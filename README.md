# Speech Recognition Using Tacotron


## Motivation
Tacotron is an end-to-end speech generation model which was first introduced in [Towards End-to-End Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10135). It takes as input text at the character level, and targets mel filterbanks and the linear spectrogram. Although it is a generation model, I felt like testing how well it can be applied to the speech recognition task.

## Requirements
  * NumPy >= 1.11.1
  * TensorFlow == 1.1
  * librosa

## Data

[The World English Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_English_Bible) is a public domain update of the American Standard Version of 1901 into modern English. Its text and audio recordings are freely available [here](http://www.audiotreasure.com/webindex.htm). Unfortunately, however, each of the audio files matches a chapter, not a verse, so is too long for many machine learning tasks. I had someone slice them by verse manually. You can download [the audio data](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42868014/WEB.zip) and its [text](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42868014/text.csv) from my dropbox.

## File description
  * `hyperparams.py` includes all hyper parameters.
  * `prepro.py` creates training and evaluation data to `data/` folder.
  * `data_load.py` loads data and put them in queues so multiple mini-bach data are generated in parallel.
  * `utils.py` has some operational functions.
  * `modules.py` contains building blocks for encoding and decoding networks.
  * `networks.py` defines encoding and decoding networks.
  * `train.py` executes training.
  * `eval.py` executes evaluation.

## Training
  * STEP 1. Adjust hyper parameters in `hyperparams.py` if necessary.
  * STEP 2. Download and extract [the audio data](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42868014/WEB.zip) and its [text](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42868014/text.csv).
  * STEP 3. Run `train.py`. Or you can download my [pretrained file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/n55aqjx6mge96pb/logdir.zip?dl=0)

## Evaluation
  * Run `eval.py` to get speech recognition results for the test set.
