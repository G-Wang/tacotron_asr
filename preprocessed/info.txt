VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_001.wav	2.05	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_002.wav	4.06	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_003.wav	7.81	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_004.wav	4.41	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_005.wav	6.53	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_006.wav	7.77	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_007.wav	6.19	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_008.wav	8.07	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_009.wav	5.59	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_010.wav	3.54	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_011.wav	9.35	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_012.wav	8.52	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_013.wav	5.76	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_014.wav	6.66	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_016.wav	7.85	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_017.wav	5.12	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_018.wav	6.36	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_019.wav	7.17	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_020.wav	7.17	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_021.wav	12.84	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_022.wav	7.56	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_023.wav	13.14	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_024.wav	7.44	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_025.wav	3.54	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_026.wav	2.56	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_027.wav	3.12	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_028.wav	3.16	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_029.wav	1.80	What do we do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_030.wav	4.53	People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_033.wav	6.66	It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_035.wav	6.23	A hostile bid is prevented for another nine months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_036.wav	4.01	It was a close call.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_037.wav	3.97	In fact, they are the future of investment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_038.wav	3.89	Diving is no part of football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_039.wav	6.40	However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_040.wav	2.52	You'd better believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_044.wav	8.45	It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_045.wav	5.38	People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_046.wav	3.80	No details of the talks were given.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_049.wav	2.26	I have learned from him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_051.wav	2.60	We are committed to the ban.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_052.wav	4.70	Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_053.wav	3.16	I have made that offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_054.wav	3.37	Four other charges were dropped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_056.wav	3.50	Clearly, it can go either way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_057.wav	6.49	However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_058.wav	3.80	However, the problem is the timing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_059.wav	5.29	But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_060.wav	3.11	Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_061.wav	5.00	Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_062.wav	3.38	I was very pleased with them today, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_063.wav	3.16	Both sides have been hit by injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_064.wav	1.80	It could take some time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_065.wav	2.99	There is no pressure on us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_066.wav	3.42	It is a job creation scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_067.wav	3.67	Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_070.wav	3.16	That is bound to happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_071.wav	2.35	He is in the queue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_072.wav	3.46	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_073.wav	2.78	So, did she meet him ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_081.wav	3.12	I had no intention of misleading anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_082.wav	4.40	That view is held by many others within the industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_083.wav	4.40	Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_084.wav	4.31	He is delighted, and he has every right to be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_086.wav	3.93	In fact, he should never have been in the field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_089.wav	3.59	Officers recovered a second body in the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_090.wav	4.31	I did not have a bet on myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_092.wav	5.81	There is a contract in existence for Allan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_094.wav	1.62	That's as it should be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_103.wav	2.79	Everyone deserves to share in this success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_104.wav	3.37	His is a success story by any standard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_108.wav	4.83	Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_109.wav	2.56	That might help a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_110.wav	3.97	Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_111.wav	2.99	It isn't a happy memory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_113.wav	3.29	The big issue for us is the review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_114.wav	5.72	I told him I was a long time ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_115.wav	4.48	Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_116.wav	5.38	Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_117.wav	5.89	We have no influence on the Government's policy on the euro.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_118.wav	3.93	We suffered a lot for seven years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_120.wav	3.42	The industry is not well organised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_121.wav	2.35	You get a lot for your money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_122.wav	2.56	I didn't feel under any pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_123.wav	3.59	It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_124.wav	2.90	As for the warning, it was not needed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_126.wav	1.68	The squad is too small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_127.wav	1.65	It is a common problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_128.wav	2.86	Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_131.wav	3.19	Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_133.wav	2.00	I think he's the favourite.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_135.wav	3.37	We have seen a copy of the report.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_136.wav	3.89	But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_141.wav	2.88	Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_142.wav	2.65	Well, you can have a tree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_143.wav	3.89	Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_144.wav	3.37	She will do for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_145.wav	2.01	Why change it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_147.wav	2.78	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_149.wav	4.95	Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_150.wav	5.33	But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_151.wav	3.59	Nothing has been put into action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_152.wav	3.03	The weather forecast isn't good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_153.wav	2.99	We have a clean bill of health.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_156.wav	4.70	I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_157.wav	4.74	He was asked to quit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_158.wav	3.80	Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_159.wav	3.72	Neither side can win this war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_165.wav	4.61	The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_166.wav	5.46	Like last month, it is simply too early to make a call.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_169.wav	6.19	Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_171.wav	6.53	The report was criticised by the Scottish Consumer Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_172.wav	2.56	Nobody did in those days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_173.wav	5.51	But the story of the play is worth a play in itself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_174.wav	4.74	He was a big influence on our decision to make this show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_175.wav	5.25	At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_176.wav	4.40	Treatment is not an issue with these people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_177.wav	5.55	The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_179.wav	3.12	They know no other way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_182.wav	2.52	We are just glad to be alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_191.wav	2.43	People will ask about us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_192.wav	3.84	However, this idea is never developed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_193.wav	3.42	It's very difficult to find a buyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_195.wav	2.43	It is hard to tell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_196.wav	3.54	I think, therefore I am ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_197.wav	2.43	Who was she ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_199.wav	2.48	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_200.wav	1.86	It looked like a river.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_201.wav	4.18	The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_202.wav	6.83	The occasion was the New Labour conference in Brighton last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_203.wav	4.57	They have the cash and the fire power.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_208.wav	2.99	You are a great player.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_210.wav	3.93	Scotland will play its part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_211.wav	4.44	He added that he was very sad about O Neill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_212.wav	4.14	After that nothing could save him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_218.wav	3.29	We used to live with dignity in our country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_219.wav	4.01	They did not attack the themes of the book.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_220.wav	6.15	He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_221.wav	2.72	It's all change at Kilmarnock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_222.wav	4.35	In each case they were a goal down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_223.wav	2.95	The police have an awful lot to explain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_224.wav	5.85	He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_225.wav	2.35	It is good for our team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_235.wav	8.54	I always felt that I was in control of the match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_236.wav	6.27	That will be the criteria for the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_237.wav	4.44	Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_238.wav	4.44	Paterson can afford to be generous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_239.wav	8.36	In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_240.wav	2.99	We are in the hat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_241.wav	4.53	Well, they were the unlucky ones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_242.wav	6.02	The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_243.wav	2.99	The irony was not lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_244.wav	3.20	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_248.wav	2.82	Does that put pressure on us ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_253.wav	5.51	Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_254.wav	2.99	The problem was a social problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_257.wav	3.16	My son was too young to die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_258.wav	3.63	We were not allowed to go to help them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_264.wav	4.48	That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_265.wav	4.91	It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_266.wav	5.00	No other vehicle was involved in the crash.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_268.wav	4.14	I realised I was lucky to have it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_273.wav	6.40	He has not created a Festival resource.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_274.wav	4.78	We have not reached the point of no return.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_275.wav	5.12	Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_276.wav	3.97	He will make an excellent chief inspector.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_277.wav	5.68	It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_279.wav	6.74	Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_280.wav	4.95	Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_281.wav	4.57	They were not at the property yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_282.wav	4.74	It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_285.wav	3.20	We have to break that cycle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_286.wav	4.27	I wanted to change the formula.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_287.wav	6.02	She said the charity would continue to monitor the case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_289.wav	4.78	Motherwell have no such good fortune.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_290.wav	3.89	Scotch beef is badly missed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_291.wav	5.89	We would hope to make progress on that next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_293.wav	5.46	It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_294.wav	4.61	However, we had no failures in our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_295.wav	4.40	Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_296.wav	3.03	It goes back a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_297.wav	4.83	Innocent people have a right to live in safety.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_298.wav	3.50	It was deployed in the Gulf War.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_299.wav	4.53	They had to learn to work from the consumer back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_300.wav	2.61	I can hardly believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_301.wav	2.90	I must do something about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_302.wav	4.36	Three hours later, the man was free.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_303.wav	5.17	And it had been a marvellous occasion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_305.wav	3.55	Cast Away now on general release.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_308.wav	2.56	I thought his speech was a disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_309.wav	1.92	Are they free ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_310.wav	1.84	What are they for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_312.wav	2.91	Do they think anyone else wants them ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_314.wav	4.66	We believe the world has too many refugees already.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_315.wav	5.47	The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_316.wav	4.06	It is beyond the government to deal with this tragedy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_317.wav	5.80	At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_318.wav	3.61	The problem was he thought you were a big man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_319.wav	3.54	There's still a bit to go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_320.wav	4.06	We have a good healthy debate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_322.wav	4.91	Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_323.wav	2.31	It is a court case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_324.wav	2.27	There is no plan B.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_325.wav	4.69	The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_326.wav	2.18	He will go a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_328.wav	4.02	It is just a tax on employment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_329.wav	5.08	There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_330.wav	4.70	We are a peaceful people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_331.wav	5.85	Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_332.wav	3.63	It's difficult to predict the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_334.wav	4.37	Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_335.wav	2.86	We are in the end game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_336.wav	4.27	I came into this world with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_337.wav	3.50	But they have the sound.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_346.wav	3.24	It wasn't a flight of fancy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_347.wav	3.67	Boy is the town a mess.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_348.wav	1.88	Does it matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_349.wav	2.31	How do you take them away ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_350.wav	4.22	However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_351.wav	2.99	After the match, do you ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_352.wav	2.99	He was then replaced by Ross.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_353.wav	3.76	THE pain was almost too much to bear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_354.wav	5.46	This action reflects a slump in bookings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_355.wav	6.23	Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_356.wav	3.50	I said he was set to retire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_357.wav	3.12	It is a sign of hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_358.wav	5.04	The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_359.wav	3.20	But we welcome this document.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_363.wav	3.08	There is The Beautiful Game to write.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_365.wav	2.09	You did not see it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p225\p225_366.wav	5.30	It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_001.wav	4.57	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_002.wav	4.74	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_003.wav	8.36	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_004.wav	6.23	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_005.wav	8.28	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_006.wav	8.75	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_007.wav	6.96	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_008.wav	11.52	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_009.wav	6.32	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_010.wav	4.18	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_011.wav	9.99	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_012.wav	5.38	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_013.wav	6.53	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_014.wav	6.79	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_015.wav	7.77	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_016.wav	8.62	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_017.wav	5.16	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_018.wav	8.11	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_019.wav	9.60	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_020.wav	5.29	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_021.wav	11.69	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_022.wav	8.28	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_023.wav	14.72	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_024.wav	9.09	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_025.wav	3.80	He has not been named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_026.wav	2.69	That's no bad thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_027.wav	5.64	They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_028.wav	5.04	Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_029.wav	5.42	We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_030.wav	3.93	Because we do not need it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_031.wav	3.25	This is the window.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_032.wav	3.08	I was an athlete.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_033.wav	5.21	From that day on we started to look for another full back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_034.wav	5.68	Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_036.wav	4.95	It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_037.wav	4.01	It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_039.wav	2.43	It has failed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_040.wav	2.01	It was clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_041.wav	3.20	It is not for any other purpose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_042.wav	5.85	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_043.wav	4.53	Is there a new way forward?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_044.wav	5.89	Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_045.wav	3.89	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_046.wav	6.15	Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_047.wav	2.82	We need to chat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_048.wav	2.18	It's a blessing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_049.wav	2.57	But it might have done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_050.wav	6.40	Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_051.wav	4.23	It has been a horrible, horrible time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_052.wav	2.74	It is the whole package.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_053.wav	2.77	He had no enemies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_054.wav	5.29	I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_055.wav	5.38	However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_056.wav	4.44	For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_057.wav	2.74	It's the big omission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_058.wav	3.93	Next league matches Celtic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_059.wav	2.35	She's a spy!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_060.wav	1.93	It is unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_061.wav	5.63	It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_062.wav	4.05	This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_063.wav	2.91	It's a real challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_064.wav	3.08	It is not great art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_065.wav	3.71	You do not change overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_066.wav	2.39	Art is extra.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_067.wav	2.35	It's a matter of balance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_068.wav	3.37	Scotland had great assets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_069.wav	3.50	I've spent a lot of time on buses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_070.wav	6.49	There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_071.wav	6.53	I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_072.wav	6.70	Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_073.wav	3.76	The script was funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_074.wav	3.50	You need a trademark.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_075.wav	4.27	Painful, but only because it's true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_076.wav	3.42	Help is needed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_077.wav	3.67	Tommy is not a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_078.wav	2.61	There could be a way back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_079.wav	2.82	Neither it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_080.wav	7.09	The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_082.wav	3.46	It is a terrible place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_083.wav	3.08	It works for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_084.wav	5.55	I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_085.wav	2.99	It can be halted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_086.wav	3.46	This is the way things should be handled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_088.wav	3.42	Detection is often difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_089.wav	4.01	He seems to be pleased with the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_090.wav	3.84	New Zealand rugby is totally different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_091.wav	3.93	Someone who cares
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_092.wav	2.35	It's just awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_093.wav	2.18	It's never too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_094.wav	4.83	Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_095.wav	3.97	That will come after the game on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_096.wav	3.33	However, it did not end that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_097.wav	2.99	We could not get any possession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_098.wav	3.20	If you could find it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_099.wav	4.65	He is hungry for success and I am the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_100.wav	5.68	They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_101.wav	3.08	It was mayhem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_102.wav	3.84	I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_103.wav	3.16	They were outside the circle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_104.wav	5.68	However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_105.wav	3.37	May not have been at fault?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_106.wav	4.57	It was some time before she found out he was safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_107.wav	3.12	It was a good performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_108.wav	3.42	That time is not now, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_109.wav	3.72	Oil embargo endorsed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_110.wav	4.14	Before the game we went for a pint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_111.wav	2.78	It was an adventure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_112.wav	4.53	The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_113.wav	5.03	The Prime Minister was very saddened to hear about this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_114.wav	3.93	It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_115.wav	4.36	I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_116.wav	3.80	It is normal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_117.wav	3.08	I don't have many friends.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_118.wav	6.32	We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_119.wav	4.27	Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_120.wav	5.29	It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_121.wav	4.40	Maybe this battle has been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_122.wav	7.21	Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_124.wav	6.23	This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_125.wav	3.20	She's got to say something.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_126.wav	5.12	It is a delight on every level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_127.wav	6.49	We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_128.wav	5.68	I felt very strongly that England should have it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_129.wav	3.37	She has been shot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_130.wav	3.72	I thought it was a fantastic game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_131.wav	2.18	I was furious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_132.wav	3.25	Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_133.wav	3.67	She really suffered for her art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_134.wav	5.30	It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_135.wav	3.97	I do not think this family will ever get over this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_136.wav	4.95	Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_137.wav	3.07	It will be too hot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_138.wav	4.48	The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_139.wav	3.46	I am now unemployed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_140.wav	4.95	They made such decisions in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_141.wav	3.59	Our intentions are real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_142.wav	3.29	Government will intervene.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_143.wav	5.55	Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_144.wav	5.72	Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_145.wav	6.87	On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_146.wav	6.87	It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_148.wav	3.76	Three penalties were given.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_149.wav	4.70	In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_150.wav	3.33	We just had a go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_151.wav	3.33	We have seen a copy of the report.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_152.wav	4.57	That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_153.wav	4.52	That group reported just before Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_154.wav	5.38	Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_155.wav	4.01	It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_156.wav	5.51	The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_157.wav	6.06	Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_158.wav	3.72	We will turn the corner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_159.wav	5.68	The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_160.wav	3.63	They should stop the bombing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_161.wav	4.06	These days are long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_162.wav	3.80	It is an attitude of mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_163.wav	4.02	I've learned from my mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_164.wav	5.55	They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_165.wav	4.06	We have to move forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_166.wav	6.32	However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_167.wav	3.59	They will do their own thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_168.wav	3.41	It is too much for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_169.wav	3.33	Nobody did in those days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_171.wav	5.16	A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_172.wav	3.88	It became a book by itself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_173.wav	3.97	His team management was protective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_174.wav	3.50	It's quite a routine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_175.wav	5.04	It is not either national standards or local control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_176.wav	4.70	If that's the case, he will struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_177.wav	2.95	I took the gun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_178.wav	4.91	Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_179.wav	4.69	No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_180.wav	4.78	I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_181.wav	2.14	I've been there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_183.wav	3.85	I have no sympathy with her at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_184.wav	5.85	It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_185.wav	3.80	It is not fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_186.wav	4.27	It just came into my head that day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_187.wav	3.80	I had a train to catch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_188.wav	5.00	Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_189.wav	4.74	The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_190.wav	4.31	Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_191.wav	6.40	Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_192.wav	3.29	People will ask about us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_193.wav	5.04	The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_194.wav	3.16	It is a case of taking a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_195.wav	4.40	It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_197.wav	3.71	There was no option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_198.wav	2.05	Is that it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_199.wav	2.99	We live by the rule of law.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_200.wav	2.95	Is that success?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_201.wav	3.46	The service from the other players was super.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_202.wav	2.31	They are in the euro.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_203.wav	4.65	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_204.wav	3.55	The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_205.wav	4.18	I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_206.wav	5.55	Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_207.wav	3.46	It's a mixture of everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_208.wav	2.95	I don't want to use it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_209.wav	3.42	Now, it's all right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_210.wav	3.33	It's like a garage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_211.wav	3.24	But I am a worried man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_212.wav	5.51	They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_213.wav	2.43	Feel the heat?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_214.wav	3.89	I'm pleased about one thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_215.wav	3.50	I am delighted for Simon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_216.wav	3.46	His third goal was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_217.wav	2.61	It's not ideal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_218.wav	2.95	I was so nervous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_219.wav	2.73	I might come back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_220.wav	6.49	For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_221.wav	6.28	Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_223.wav	5.21	But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_224.wav	3.89	It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_225.wav	4.57	A career as a doctor is on hold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_226.wav	5.34	At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_227.wav	5.93	Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_228.wav	3.29	I am immensely sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_229.wav	3.88	I'd never seen a play about me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_230.wav	6.70	The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_231.wav	4.78	The track is currently covered in snow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_232.wav	3.85	My wife and family are the support system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_233.wav	5.59	Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_234.wav	4.61	Stewart will travel with some confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_235.wav	5.85	Police later said the scheme would end in November.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_236.wav	3.55	It is set in Paris.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_237.wav	5.12	It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_238.wav	4.06	Hospitals are for the ill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_239.wav	5.08	It would still have been a good film, but very different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_240.wav	3.88	She is well balanced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_241.wav	4.44	They are all bright and different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_242.wav	2.82	It's only fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_243.wav	5.55	We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_244.wav	6.87	It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_245.wav	5.08	I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_246.wav	3.12	His body was never found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_247.wav	4.74	We did not compete with any other local farmer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_248.wav	2.52	I was shocked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_249.wav	2.39	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_251.wav	2.61	There's the mix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_252.wav	4.61	There will be widespread support on all sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_253.wav	4.10	I was never going to play against Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_254.wav	4.27	At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_255.wav	5.08	That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_256.wav	4.70	Blair is very positive at European Councils.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_257.wav	5.89	Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_258.wav	5.85	That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_259.wav	6.91	Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_260.wav	5.04	It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_261.wav	5.98	He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_262.wav	5.76	Today we can say that a new era has begun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_263.wav	4.61	I would have the hammer in the crowd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_264.wav	5.21	This court has made an order which has not been observed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_265.wav	5.47	The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_266.wav	3.42	The warning is timely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_267.wav	6.06	George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_268.wav	5.25	That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_269.wav	3.25	They are never here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_270.wav	4.14	We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_271.wav	3.03	He was popular.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_272.wav	4.14	Frankly, we should all have such problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_273.wav	5.04	It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_274.wav	5.42	She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_276.wav	2.61	It's a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_278.wav	2.86	I feel pretty good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_279.wav	4.74	In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_280.wav	3.33	He has a wealth of experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_281.wav	2.69	It happens from time to time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_283.wav	2.73	He looked very sharp.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_284.wav	5.34	Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_285.wav	2.39	It was a virus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_286.wav	2.44	Yet, it worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_287.wav	2.35	Who will perform?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_288.wav	5.68	The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_289.wav	3.16	This is a national crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_290.wav	3.07	Scotland were beaten again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_291.wav	4.82	It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_292.wav	3.03	It goes back a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_293.wav	4.99	He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_294.wav	3.12	The results are sometimes contentious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_295.wav	2.01	He should have won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_296.wav	6.87	If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_297.wav	2.22	There's a pause.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_298.wav	5.55	The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_299.wav	3.37	There was no hint of scandal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_300.wav	3.84	I thought it was my only chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_301.wav	4.61	However, the snow was welcomed by some.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_302.wav	4.14	Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_303.wav	2.31	One was a lawyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_304.wav	3.07	Our task is to complete the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_305.wav	5.46	A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_306.wav	4.91	We believe the world has too many refugees already.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_307.wav	4.57	The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_308.wav	3.20	This is a war over our home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_309.wav	5.29	In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_310.wav	5.46	It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_311.wav	4.44	I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_312.wav	4.53	It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_313.wav	3.29	The minister is the engineer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_314.wav	2.82	I did not name it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_315.wav	3.08	It was a question of patience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_316.wav	3.08	The whole region is in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_317.wav	3.80	It's about my time as a guitarist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_318.wav	2.18	Kids are terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_319.wav	3.59	Craig is a major concern for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_320.wav	3.46	The home team had an amazing start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_321.wav	3.59	My body is clearly capable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_322.wav	3.07	Referees are easy targets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_323.wav	2.69	He said she was mad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_324.wav	2.60	We are in the end game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_325.wav	3.37	I am very happy to be here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_326.wav	3.42	The airport was even different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_327.wav	2.43	We do the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_328.wav	2.43	That's the law of the land.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_329.wav	4.66	But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_330.wav	4.14	The weekly average was three hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_331.wav	2.91	Donald was his friend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_332.wav	2.30	I am so upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_333.wav	4.48	It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_334.wav	5.85	On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_335.wav	3.20	The boat was fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_336.wav	3.03	It is a time bomb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_337.wav	2.95	I'd like to take the plunge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_338.wav	4.01	Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_339.wav	4.74	My view has now completely changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_340.wav	5.33	You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_341.wav	3.93	In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_342.wav	2.91	Three years ago he would have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_343.wav	4.44	I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_344.wav	5.42	He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_345.wav	4.61	They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_346.wav	4.61	But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_347.wav	4.48	It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_348.wav	2.43	Look at the witnesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_349.wav	3.33	He's been the key to everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_350.wav	4.57	That is the very reason why it was so vital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_351.wav	6.74	This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_352.wav	3.80	His contract was then not renewed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_353.wav	5.04	A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_354.wav	5.08	That is a break with tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_355.wav	5.80	A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_356.wav	2.35	She is free.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_357.wav	2.78	I kept going for her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_358.wav	4.01	You must have a government and a good civil service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_359.wav	2.73	He's very explosive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_360.wav	4.10	No other job in world football can compare to this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_361.wav	2.60	Our numbers are small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_362.wav	5.80	Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_363.wav	5.04	Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_364.wav	3.12	This is a club on the rise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_365.wav	2.82	I have got a wife to feed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_366.wav	4.65	It's not pretty, but it's effective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_367.wav	4.01	Equity declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_368.wav	5.76	All the investment is possible through the public sector.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_369.wav	3.16	He took over our lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p226\p226_370.wav	6.06	Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_001.wav	4.70	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_002.wav	6.83	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_003.wav	8.79	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_004.wav	5.46	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_005.wav	8.11	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_006.wav	7.26	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_008.wav	8.61	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_009.wav	6.02	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_010.wav	5.04	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_011.wav	9.09	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_012.wav	5.97	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_013.wav	5.46	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_014.wav	6.23	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_015.wav	7.08	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_016.wav	8.02	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_017.wav	4.14	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_018.wav	7.43	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection in the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_019.wav	8.79	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_020.wav	5.29	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_021.wav	10.54	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_022.wav	7.90	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_023.wav	13.53	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_024.wav	8.24	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_025.wav	3.63	Meetings will also remain private.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_026.wav	2.82	Movement has to take place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_027.wav	3.03	I feel I did not have enough time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_028.wav	2.18	We will look into it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_029.wav	2.69	This is a central issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_030.wav	3.50	Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_031.wav	3.46	The Premier League has been a huge success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_032.wav	2.86	There, you were just a body.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_033.wav	2.77	It is not for any other purpose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_034.wav	3.16	President Bush is at war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_035.wav	3.08	I became a widow overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_036.wav	3.55	Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_037.wav	3.59	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_038.wav	3.33	She hopes to study in Britain one day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_039.wav	3.08	Among them are many criminals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_040.wav	3.63	Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_041.wav	2.60	He looks like an Afghan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_042.wav	3.67	It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_043.wav	2.73	I'd come back from London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_044.wav	2.13	If I was a woman.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_045.wav	2.86	He was a home referee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_046.wav	2.52	There was no safety net.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_047.wav	3.55	The casting of her husband was an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_048.wav	3.59	We have to look beyond the very short term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_049.wav	3.12	I expect a rapid response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_050.wav	3.16	That is very hard, alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_051.wav	3.54	The motive for the shooting was not known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_052.wav	4.31	In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_053.wav	3.12	Four other charges were dropped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_054.wav	2.65	I could not do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_055.wav	2.82	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_056.wav	2.18	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_057.wav	2.44	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_058.wav	2.44	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_059.wav	2.39	What do we do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_060.wav	4.82	The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_061.wav	4.78	There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_062.wav	3.72	They have to come up with a solution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_063.wav	2.86	We will pay their bills.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_064.wav	7.34	Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_065.wav	4.74	He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_066.wav	4.14	Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_067.wav	3.16	I have proved that in the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_068.wav	2.61	He had been a singer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_069.wav	4.65	They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_070.wav	3.46	Then followed a bout of flu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_071.wav	3.46	Both sides have been hit by injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_072.wav	4.35	Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_073.wav	2.90	It is a terrible place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_074.wav	2.99	Even the one she loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_075.wav	3.97	After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_076.wav	2.99	There may be reasons for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_077.wav	3.12	I first met him last summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_078.wav	3.54	Last week, he was taken into hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_079.wav	4.01	Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_080.wav	3.97	Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_081.wav	3.46	By then, he was walking on water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_082.wav	4.44	We have to offer value for money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_083.wav	4.06	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_084.wav	5.74	Potions said he would drive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_085.wav	3.59	The latter is due to be finished in February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_086.wav	3.71	This is a complex and detailed report.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_087.wav	4.44	The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_088.wav	3.33	We will deal with the refugees.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_089.wav	2.69	You might not make it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_090.wav	3.59	It is open season on the Old Firm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_091.wav	3.25	That is the important thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_092.wav	3.76	For once, you should believe the hype.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_093.wav	4.57	Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_094.wav	2.65	Their attitude is all wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_095.wav	2.44	You are like an animal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_096.wav	3.12	No, the equipment is extra.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_097.wav	3.63	The following are the principal provisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_098.wav	5.08	It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_099.wav	4.18	While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_100.wav	2.82	I had a fortunate war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_101.wav	3.93	I did not see any reason to change the captain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_102.wav	2.73	Saddam Hussein is a devil.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_103.wav	3.07	It was never a starter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_104.wav	3.42	And the match was not too bad, either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_105.wav	3.84	Such actions are rarely popular.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_106.wav	3.25	It is safe in our hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_107.wav	3.59	Then came the farewell to Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_108.wav	3.59	It is much as it has been described.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_109.wav	3.38	You can spend money on housing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_110.wav	3.76	That admission is not surprising.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_111.wav	4.14	Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_112.wav	3.59	It has removed a bit of guilt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_113.wav	3.37	However, we have to be cautious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_114.wav	3.67	But we could only help a handful of people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_116.wav	4.27	It is just a tax on employment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_117.wav	4.48	This should begin in October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_118.wav	2.82	My life has changed a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_119.wav	2.86	We did what we had to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_120.wav	2.95	Why do it otherwise ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_121.wav	4.61	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_122.wav	4.23	So, did she meet him ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_123.wav	3.59	So what is the campaign about ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_124.wav	3.50	And does it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_125.wav	3.16	You've got to be vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_126.wav	5.76	We are amazed that the current trading figures were so weak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_127.wav	4.87	Any success would have been an improvement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_128.wav	6.66	On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_129.wav	4.35	And I have some advice for my old friend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_130.wav	4.22	He is a great addition to our team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_131.wav	5.34	However, this move is dependent upon the sale of the existing site.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_132.wav	2.95	I felt he was excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_133.wav	2.56	They could use a boost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_134.wav	2.69	It is a vicious circle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_135.wav	2.99	We could easily have lost that game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_136.wav	2.90	This is a limited market.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_137.wav	3.46	Our position is quite simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_138.wav	4.40	Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_139.wav	4.23	Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_140.wav	3.49	Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_141.wav	2.82	He's not a Celtic man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_142.wav	3.89	It opens the door to the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_143.wav	2.86	So I got a blood test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_144.wav	4.87	It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_145.wav	3.80	These men are a part of India.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_146.wav	3.16	Like the others, he was arrested.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_147.wav	3.25	There's only one team in Ayrshire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_148.wav	3.50	It was deployed in the Gulf War.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_149.wav	4.10	That was the difference between the sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_150.wav	5.85	Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_151.wav	3.24	I was shaking on the blocks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_152.wav	3.24	She had gone to the Catholic school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_153.wav	4.23	This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_154.wav	4.27	The strong pound also took its toll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_155.wav	2.60	It was a funny feeling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_156.wav	3.16	I'd love to be like Peter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_157.wav	3.50	Adams is surely worth a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_158.wav	2.22	It is difficult to say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_159.wav	3.12	He was in great spirits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_160.wav	3.84	Seven people were later detained by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_161.wav	1.49	They want to see him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_162.wav	4.31	Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_163.wav	3.33	Nobody did in those days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_164.wav	3.59	There is no signature on this document.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_165.wav	2.78	We've made a couple of albums.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_166.wav	2.52	What happened in that game ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_167.wav	2.30	Are you going to win ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_168.wav	2.82	Was it the wife ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_169.wav	2.18	Why change it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_170.wav	3.67	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_171.wav	3.24	The people are the hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_172.wav	4.44	One season, they might do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_173.wav	3.80	They made such decisions in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_174.wav	4.74	The second aspect was the fear of failure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_175.wav	3.16	The jury is still out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_176.wav	3.03	But he has a lifeline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_177.wav	5.16	The expansions will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_178.wav	3.71	I'm just going to hit the shot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_179.wav	4.53	It makes no influence on the public.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_180.wav	6.62	That will apply to both sets of fans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_181.wav	2.73	I think it's a good sign.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_183.wav	2.69	I have spoken to head office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_184.wav	2.95	Well, you can have a tree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_186.wav	3.54	They bought the property four years ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_187.wav	2.99	He is believed to live in Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_188.wav	2.73	We've just had it confirmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_189.wav	4.02	A copy of the report will be sent to them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_190.wav	3.16	This is the time to use it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_191.wav	2.95	You know the sort of thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_192.wav	5.68	They were seriously after him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_193.wav	5.34	It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_194.wav	4.48	Trading conditions have not been that bad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_195.wav	3.54	I'm interested in interesting work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_196.wav	3.89	It will be reviewed in The Herald tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_197.wav	3.41	The force is with them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_198.wav	3.12	If the director is with you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_199.wav	3.29	He made no order on costs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_200.wav	3.29	I guess I was lucky, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_201.wav	5.89	This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_203.wav	3.63	It was served by sheriff officers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_204.wav	2.86	This will be our new beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_205.wav	3.24	They have the cash and the fire power.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_206.wav	2.99	My heart is with the artist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_207.wav	3.16	That might mean another delay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_208.wav	3.20	However, it is not as simple as this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_209.wav	4.10	The sanctions are about collective punishment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_210.wav	2.56	This is a holy place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_211.wav	2.48	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_212.wav	2.95	how do you get it back ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_213.wav	4.01	What are you not good at ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_214.wav	3.33	I think, therefore I am ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_215.wav	2.74	Who was she ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_216.wav	4.10	You have caught a serial killer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_217.wav	4.14	It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_218.wav	4.01	The move follows a review of the Singapore
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_219.wav	5.89	They make a selective perception process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_220.wav	4.91	There is no quick fix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_222.wav	3.80	They have known the hard times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_223.wav	3.16	That might help a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_226.wav	2.90	I'm just a regular person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_227.wav	2.86	My daughter is an adult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_228.wav	4.31	He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_229.wav	2.90	It's just a normal life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_230.wav	3.33	He must get to know himself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_231.wav	4.78	And the World Cup has not even begun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_232.wav	5.17	He remains a main board director of Royal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_233.wav	2.35	The fight is under way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_235.wav	3.42	It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_236.wav	4.57	They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_237.wav	3.29	We can certainly build on this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_238.wav	3.38	William Hague delighted his party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_239.wav	2.90	There is a world of difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_240.wav	2.99	We played them off the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_241.wav	3.03	If it doesn't, it doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_242.wav	2.48	I can't wait to meet him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_243.wav	3.80	My wife and family are the support system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_244.wav	5.29	They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_245.wav	3.42	It is the voice of the survivors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_246.wav	2.65	She died in middle age.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_247.wav	2.60	It is set in Paris.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_248.wav	2.78	You will have seen the adverts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_249.wav	3.93	It is possible to be too good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_250.wav	4.14	Moreover, it must be for all sports.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_251.wav	3.71	They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_252.wav	2.95	The irony was not lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_253.wav	3.76	Three weeks later, he resigned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_254.wav	2.26	It is a court case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_255.wav	4.53	It might be sad, but it's a fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_256.wav	2.69	She took them for a term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_257.wav	3.16	Kingfisher can afford to wait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_258.wav	3.12	Nato was not a love affair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_259.wav	4.74	We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_260.wav	4.74	Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_261.wav	3.42	You can feel at home in China.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_262.wav	3.50	Our decision making was poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_263.wav	4.44	The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_264.wav	3.93	The baby deserves the credit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_265.wav	3.29	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_266.wav	3.76	Was everything done to save people ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_267.wav	3.12	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_268.wav	3.25	Do I think about them often ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_269.wav	2.99	Is it in the right place ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_270.wav	2.31	Did he trip ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_271.wav	4.36	In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_272.wav	3.29	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_273.wav	3.89	No production contract is yet in sight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_274.wav	3.50	The capital costs are modest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_275.wav	3.59	This is no reflection on Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_276.wav	2.65	I told you I was ill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_277.wav	2.26	I can't get a job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_278.wav	4.06	That could be in place by next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_279.wav	2.99	On the contrary they stand to gain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_280.wav	4.27	Blair is very positive at European Councils.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_281.wav	3.62	I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_282.wav	3.42	It does not work that way in Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_283.wav	2.69	Every one is a winner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_284.wav	3.33	There's not much money in cycling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_285.wav	4.31	This court has made an order which has not been observed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_286.wav	3.63	Not many companies can say that these days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_287.wav	2.77	They can leave at any time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_288.wav	3.25	You get a lot for your money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_289.wav	3.84	As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_290.wav	4.35	It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_291.wav	3.20	It was an easy decision to come here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_292.wav	4.52	Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_293.wav	4.87	He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_294.wav	2.74	But the plot is not the point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_295.wav	2.91	It was never a free kick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_296.wav	2.35	My body is a wreck.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_297.wav	3.42	It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_298.wav	3.93	She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_299.wav	2.74	She failed in her action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_300.wav	2.95	Stephen will get his first cap.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_301.wav	2.56	It's hard to see it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_302.wav	3.25	Her appeal is to be heard this week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_303.wav	3.50	We have to be very, very careful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_304.wav	3.84	The partnership was set up during the summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_305.wav	4.95	There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_306.wav	2.95	It is an amazing response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_307.wav	2.18	Size is not the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_308.wav	3.12	He will address the nation this evening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_309.wav	2.69	We have the easy part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_310.wav	2.73	We are not increasing the number.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_311.wav	4.66	I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_312.wav	3.88	They do not reflect the quality of the brand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_313.wav	2.78	It could well be military.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_314.wav	3.76	And that culture is everywhere in Dublin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_315.wav	3.20	His job was not advertised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_316.wav	2.78	This is a big step up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_317.wav	2.48	It goes back a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_318.wav	2.95	The weather forecast isn't good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_319.wav	2.65	We have a clean bill of health.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_320.wav	3.42	In that case, the children were not missing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_321.wav	2.26	I have got a victim.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_322.wav	2.35	The judge was really nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_323.wav	4.01	If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_324.wav	2.90	McNaughton was not so sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_326.wav	3.07	The dealer is on notice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_327.wav	4.06	It is hoped to complete the merger in the summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_328.wav	3.07	The party lasted all night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_329.wav	2.56	He would help me with the form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_330.wav	2.82	There's still a bit to go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_331.wav	2.95	I'm not worried about the critics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_332.wav	2.69	I would do away with the dress code.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_333.wav	2.99	It is so easy to be negative.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_334.wav	4.65	What form did that take ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_335.wav	2.05	Are they free ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_336.wav	2.95	What are they for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_337.wav	2.82	Is there a waiting list ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_338.wav	3.46	Do they think anyone else wants them ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_339.wav	2.31	So what happens next ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_340.wav	4.14	The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_341.wav	2.91	I am not obsessed with sex.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_342.wav	2.95	Have a look at this lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_343.wav	4.14	That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_344.wav	3.16	Public opinion was split on the proposal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_345.wav	3.03	The king is delighted by the honour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_347.wav	2.73	I've got a sense of humour, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_348.wav	3.07	In the old days, it was easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_349.wav	3.46	I came into this world with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_350.wav	4.31	This is a trend which will be encouraged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_351.wav	4.02	There will have to be a full inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_352.wav	2.60	There was no time scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_353.wav	3.59	In his absence, the council adopted the change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_354.wav	3.59	Whether this return was too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_355.wav	4.57	The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_356.wav	3.37	They were the acts of men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_357.wav	4.83	Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_358.wav	2.61	Of course, we want to go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_359.wav	3.46	I am very interested in the subject.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_360.wav	3.72	He is not very big, either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_361.wav	3.03	A report is expected next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_363.wav	3.97	We are encouraged by the news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_364.wav	3.12	Had this been common practice ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_365.wav	3.08	What do they want us to do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_366.wav	2.35	Is it worth it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_367.wav	2.05	Does it matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_368.wav	3.84	A crucial moment has arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_369.wav	4.01	Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_370.wav	3.80	We need to be prepared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_371.wav	4.70	Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_372.wav	3.20	His views are hardly surprising.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_373.wav	5.51	The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_374.wav	4.02	It has been made to entertain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_375.wav	3.07	It is a stroke of genius.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_376.wav	3.42	Italy was just behind the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_377.wav	3.54	It was forced to divert.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_378.wav	3.12	Alex Ferguson is the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_379.wav	4.01	I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_380.wav	2.99	We are still getting over it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_382.wav	3.37	This will impact on us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_383.wav	3.76	From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_384.wav	2.09	He is in the queue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_385.wav	3.67	The salary changes are long overdue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_386.wav	2.73	I do not like to lose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_387.wav	3.46	I am a member of the Labour Party staff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_388.wav	2.73	There is no deal as yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_389.wav	3.42	In due course the deal was done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_390.wav	3.16	Celtic were pleased to help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_391.wav	2.91	They will fight for everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_392.wav	3.33	That's not like us at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_393.wav	3.71	You have to rely on each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_394.wav	3.29	I wanted to go out on a high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_395.wav	4.23	I felt the head was very like me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_396.wav	3.42	It is a terrible equation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_397.wav	4.27	They have not got anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_398.wav	2.78	I can hardly believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_399.wav	2.65	How do you take them away ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_400.wav	3.24	However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_401.wav	4.06	After the match, do you ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p227\p227_402.wav	3.29	Persuaded to change his mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_001.wav	2.69	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_002.wav	5.30	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_003.wav	9.77	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_004.wav	6.96	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_005.wav	7.72	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_006.wav	6.53	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_007.wav	5.59	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_008.wav	10.41	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_009.wav	7.13	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_010.wav	4.35	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_011.wav	8.54	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_012.wav	5.21	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_013.wav	5.16	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_014.wav	5.85	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_015.wav	7.22	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_016.wav	8.19	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_018.wav	5.63	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_019.wav	8.11	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_020.wav	4.66	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_021.wav	10.24	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_022.wav	9.31	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_023.wav	13.10	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_024.wav	7.51	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_025.wav	2.26	It's nice to hear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_026.wav	5.04	So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_027.wav	2.18	Because we do not need it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_028.wav	4.06	There's a story, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_029.wav	3.07	I feel I did not have enough time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_030.wav	2.61	Life was like a timetable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_031.wav	2.99	He took me on a tour of the wards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_032.wav	4.40	We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_033.wav	3.97	However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_034.wav	3.50	In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_035.wav	1.62	It was clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_036.wav	2.22	The problem is the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_037.wav	1.62	Indeed, he does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_038.wav	2.35	President Bush is at war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_039.wav	3.08	She is believed to be in South Africa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_040.wav	2.09	My whole life has changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_041.wav	3.50	On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_042.wav	2.90	No meaningful response was issued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_043.wav	1.62	It is urgent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_044.wav	4.35	Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_045.wav	4.22	Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_046.wav	1.67	We need to chat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_047.wav	4.49	We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_048.wav	4.10	The Scottish Parliament is also looking at similar measures.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_049.wav	2.26	But it might have done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_050.wav	3.03	Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_051.wav	3.63	Mary Archer is almost too clever.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_052.wav	2.43	He looks like an Afghan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_053.wav	1.96	Here's a clue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_054.wav	2.60	It had been in place since last July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_055.wav	4.14	However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_056.wav	2.26	That's the day job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_057.wav	3.93	For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_058.wav	1.75	That's the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_059.wav	2.90	That is very hard, alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_060.wav	3.63	He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_061.wav	2.99	Four other charges were dropped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_062.wav	1.96	They're appalled by that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_063.wav	2.22	There was a battle there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_064.wav	2.78	Scotland had great assets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_065.wav	2.22	It's that kind of place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_066.wav	5.21	Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_067.wav	5.04	An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_068.wav	3.20	And if he hadn't become a musician ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_069.wav	2.95	He is a young man with a new deal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_070.wav	3.97	Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_071.wav	2.31	The script was funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_072.wav	1.88	Try to save us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_073.wav	2.86	Sounds like The Sixth Sense ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_074.wav	3.03	Painful, but only because it's true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_075.wav	3.76	They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_076.wav	3.50	It's all I can do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_077.wav	3.63	They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_078.wav	6.02	Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_079.wav	2.82	I had my suspicions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_081.wav	3.59	People must remain vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_082.wav	3.03	Today she has been released.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_083.wav	4.91	That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_084.wav	4.87	He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_085.wav	2.43	But she might be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_086.wav	2.77	Nothing is yet confirmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_087.wav	3.89	Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_088.wav	4.99	It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_089.wav	5.21	Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_090.wav	4.27	Now the system is right behind us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_091.wav	4.82	Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_092.wav	2.86	Today I couldn't run on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_093.wav	3.63	However, it did not end that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_094.wav	3.80	This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_095.wav	2.86	Safety was also an issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_096.wav	3.33	It is an old family habit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_097.wav	5.59	I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_098.wav	3.50	The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_099.wav	2.48	It is annoying.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_100.wav	2.95	We could not get any possession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_101.wav	2.60	I love the Dome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_102.wav	5.46	We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_103.wav	3.80	I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_104.wav	4.02	He is hungry for success and I am the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_105.wav	5.68	Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_106.wav	5.17	Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_107.wav	3.93	It is a good day for the coalition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_108.wav	4.66	A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_109.wav	6.23	However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_110.wav	4.83	We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_111.wav	6.74	Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_112.wav	4.78	We have an election in eight days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_113.wav	4.01	For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_114.wav	3.55	They will want to perform well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_115.wav	3.54	The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_116.wav	4.10	However, they will only be found in the wild.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_117.wav	5.85	It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_118.wav	3.16	Further protests are likely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_119.wav	2.48	It's in his blood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_120.wav	2.73	I don't want to use the term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_121.wav	3.80	The picture is the same across Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_122.wav	5.25	Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_123.wav	2.82	It is so sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_124.wav	5.17	It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_125.wav	5.55	Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_126.wav	3.50	Who would be a referee ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_127.wav	3.12	They've got to account for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_128.wav	3.63	It is a delight on every level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_129.wav	5.25	An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_130.wav	4.44	Here, again, they were denied a voice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_131.wav	4.65	I felt very strongly that England should have it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_132.wav	5.68	It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_133.wav	4.48	This plan is an agenda for action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_134.wav	4.40	Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_135.wav	4.95	Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_136.wav	4.18	Offered the gold medal, he declined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_137.wav	2.82	Who will attend ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_138.wav	2.90	We had a reunion last week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_139.wav	4.61	Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_140.wav	5.68	We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_141.wav	3.42	I was the last man to touch the ball.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_142.wav	4.14	He was in a great deal of pain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_143.wav	4.31	Nobody in the world can get away from him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_144.wav	4.02	She hopes to study in Britain one day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_145.wav	3.25	Wallace was a prisoner of war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_146.wav	3.84	I think he's the favourite, no question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_147.wav	2.86	Who would be right ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_148.wav	2.57	It is difficult for Ali.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_149.wav	5.59	Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_150.wav	4.01	Had she enjoyed the experience ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_151.wav	2.26	That should do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_152.wav	4.61	That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_153.wav	2.90	It is not just about pay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_154.wav	3.12	I am just trying to do my job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_155.wav	4.22	It opens the door to the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_156.wav	3.97	The home side didn't stand a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_157.wav	4.48	The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_158.wav	3.25	The weather forecast isn't good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_159.wav	6.36	The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_160.wav	4.44	There's a sense of excess in the novel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_161.wav	4.05	We also enjoyed a lot of support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_162.wav	3.08	It was by the numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_163.wav	3.16	I was in daily contact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_164.wav	4.78	The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_165.wav	4.53	Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_166.wav	4.35	It was so new, so exciting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_167.wav	4.53	But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_168.wav	4.95	I've put my own money into this project.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_169.wav	4.35	Eight months later, he was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_170.wav	4.44	They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_171.wav	2.90	We have to move forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_172.wav	4.95	By then, however, both men were already in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_173.wav	3.54	We have to sort it out ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_174.wav	2.77	The post will be unpaid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_175.wav	5.55	As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_176.wav	3.88	And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_177.wav	3.80	We've made a couple of albums.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_178.wav	3.97	They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_179.wav	4.74	Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_180.wav	3.72	One season, they might do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_181.wav	5.17	However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_182.wav	5.08	It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_183.wav	3.46	The hotel was now for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_184.wav	2.86	I drove the ball well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_185.wav	2.27	I took the gun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_186.wav	2.82	We knew nothing about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_187.wav	2.73	They will run a mile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_188.wav	4.19	It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_189.wav	5.25	Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_190.wav	2.82	Miller was every bit as happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_191.wav	2.78	I put the drawing down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_192.wav	4.91	The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_193.wav	3.55	It was an odd affair, in many respects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_194.wav	4.23	Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_195.wav	4.48	We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_196.wav	5.38	We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_197.wav	4.74	The procedure is the same in all cases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_198.wav	5.93	But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_199.wav	5.68	The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_200.wav	4.01	I wanted to put myself on the line.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_202.wav	2.99	It's the same old story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_203.wav	5.00	It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_204.wav	2.78	Is that success ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_205.wav	2.52	I have a cold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_206.wav	3.42	They are in the euro.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_207.wav	3.03	Ferguson should take note.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_208.wav	4.27	I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_209.wav	3.12	Who will pay for this ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_210.wav	3.76	They've got three-quarters of the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_211.wav	3.50	He had suffered a heart attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_212.wav	3.33	A deadline is still essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_213.wav	5.12	Yet she is still the woman behind the famous man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_214.wav	4.82	We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_215.wav	5.38	After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_216.wav	2.90	That will be vital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_217.wav	4.48	Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_218.wav	4.70	That is an important part of our role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_219.wav	3.16	She should not be blamed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_220.wav	3.71	I had decided to quit the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_221.wav	3.33	His third goal was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_222.wav	2.95	It's been a good year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_223.wav	5.33	The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_224.wav	5.29	He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_225.wav	4.57	Women were mostly notable by their absence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_226.wav	5.25	The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_227.wav	3.12	Clearly, the stakes are high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_228.wav	2.09	It is a gamble.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_229.wav	2.48	It's so special.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_230.wav	2.95	You take a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_231.wav	2.52	He is severe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_232.wav	2.95	We just had a go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_233.wav	2.86	We are in the hat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_234.wav	2.90	We were a load of rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_235.wav	3.42	Well, they were the unlucky ones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_236.wav	5.98	On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_237.wav	4.83	The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_238.wav	4.78	I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_239.wav	4.19	He claimed the government had lost the plot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_240.wav	3.08	She was well balanced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_241.wav	2.52	It's only fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_242.wav	5.72	He says that he is no different from any other man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_243.wav	4.14	You can feel at home in China.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_244.wav	5.85	In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_245.wav	5.21	It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_246.wav	4.31	Washington is consumed by the crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_247.wav	2.52	He's a lovely young man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_248.wav	2.86	It was a hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_249.wav	4.48	He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_250.wav	2.82	I can't get a job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_251.wav	5.16	He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_252.wav	5.51	It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_253.wav	5.08	That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_254.wav	5.38	Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_255.wav	4.31	That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_256.wav	5.04	One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_257.wav	2.82	Is that a serious question ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_258.wav	2.44	They are real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_259.wav	2.99	They must play for each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_260.wav	4.10	I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_261.wav	3.50	His contract was then not renewed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_262.wav	4.70	He thought he had a month to cross the street.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_263.wav	5.93	Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_264.wav	5.38	That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_265.wav	5.16	Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_266.wav	5.64	Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_267.wav	5.76	It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_268.wav	2.73	I was rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_269.wav	4.06	He's been here on numerous occasions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_270.wav	6.11	Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_271.wav	3.37	It's a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_272.wav	6.53	The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_274.wav	5.30	It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_275.wav	2.69	They were too hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_276.wav	4.95	There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_277.wav	5.21	Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_278.wav	2.61	All options are open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_279.wav	4.36	He will address the nation this evening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_280.wav	4.23	We want to see the maximum of change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_281.wav	4.36	Mr Campbell received a phone call.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_282.wav	3.59	He was obviously very genuine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_283.wav	4.70	She said she could not believe that they had run away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_284.wav	3.03	It changed my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_285.wav	3.37	The songs are just so good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_286.wav	5.30	I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_287.wav	4.53	Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_288.wav	3.37	It became a book by itself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_289.wav	4.40	The home was now under new management.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_290.wav	3.12	Graeme was prepared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_291.wav	4.53	Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_292.wav	6.83	He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_293.wav	3.93	Our task is to complete the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_294.wav	2.99	They are wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_295.wav	4.74	It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_296.wav	6.57	They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_297.wav	3.08	You are the glory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_298.wav	2.86	It's certainly different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_299.wav	5.63	A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_300.wav	3.71	We want to play at the worlds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_301.wav	3.33	We have waited a long time for this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_302.wav	3.46	Is there on his hands ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_303.wav	4.74	This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_304.wav	2.99	It's not even finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_305.wav	2.99	We are a peaceful people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_306.wav	2.82	Kids are terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_307.wav	3.84	The problems began a long time ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_308.wav	4.02	This film will be totally awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_309.wav	5.00	He said she was mad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_310.wav	2.76	There was some merit in that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_311.wav	3.08	I am very happy to be here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_312.wav	3.03	We do the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_313.wav	4.61	In his absence, the council adopted the change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_315.wav	2.95	It's not long enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_316.wav	3.12	Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_317.wav	4.87	It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_318.wav	3.59	He was then replaced by Ross.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_319.wav	2.78	Is that an issue ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_320.wav	4.44	My first concern is for the safety of the public.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_321.wav	3.80	Robert is a special talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_322.wav	5.63	A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_323.wav	5.38	You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_324.wav	3.03	There was no option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_325.wav	4.91	The same things will happen with GM foods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_326.wav	3.25	It is a sign of hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_327.wav	4.95	Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_328.wav	5.04	It has moved on in the last week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_329.wav	4.87	The train was on time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_330.wav	2.86	It is so unfair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_331.wav	2.39	He has to learn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_332.wav	4.78	But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_333.wav	3.33	I've got no secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_334.wav	3.76	Tiger is the exception.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_335.wav	3.54	A great deal has been achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_336.wav	4.19	It was forced to divert.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_337.wav	4.91	In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_338.wav	3.67	This is a friendly match ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_339.wav	5.38	I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_340.wav	2.52	He's a genius.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_341.wav	4.23	They should take their mobile phones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_342.wav	4.57	It is not like working for a living.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_343.wav	3.29	It's the last thing on my mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_344.wav	5.00	The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_345.wav	5.93	He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_346.wav	4.44	That is a break with tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_347.wav	2.13	She is free.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_348.wav	3.54	Everyone was in tears.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_349.wav	4.87	You must have a government and a good civil service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_350.wav	3.33	As, indeed, they would be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_351.wav	6.53	No other job in world football can compare to this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_352.wav	4.14	I expected these kind of questions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_353.wav	5.68	It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_354.wav	5.38	He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_355.wav	3.84	It's not pretty, but it's effective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_356.wav	2.65	Equity declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_357.wav	5.34	He later became a respected High Court judge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_358.wav	3.67	The play is based on a real-life event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_359.wav	5.93	We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_360.wav	5.59	The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_361.wav	4.14	He put some colour into Scottish history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_362.wav	5.00	It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_363.wav	4.91	I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_364.wav	3.84	It is a simple equation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_365.wav	2.95	So there, we won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_366.wav	2.52	But I managed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_367.wav	4.10	By that time, however, it was already too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_368.wav	4.49	I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_369.wav	3.63	There is no signature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_370.wav	3.95	It's a record label, not a form of music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p228\p228_371.wav	3.54	It became a national network.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_001.wav	2.14	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_002.wav	4.01	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_003.wav	7.17	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_004.wav	4.87	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_005.wav	6.23	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_006.wav	5.38	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_007.wav	3.93	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_008.wav	7.08	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_009.wav	4.10	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_010.wav	3.37	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_011.wav	6.70	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_012.wav	4.40	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_013.wav	4.65	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_014.wav	4.83	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_015.wav	5.42	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_016.wav	6.06	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_017.wav	3.50	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_018.wav	5.89	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_019.wav	8.07	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_020.wav	4.27	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_021.wav	9.09	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_022.wav	6.49	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_023.wav	11.27	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_024.wav	7.77	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_025.wav	1.62	Johnson was pretty low.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_026.wav	3.38	He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_027.wav	1.80	It's nice to hear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_028.wav	4.74	Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_029.wav	1.71	I have a theory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_030.wav	3.38	It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_031.wav	4.40	So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_032.wav	2.48	Because we do not need it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_033.wav	1.92	And we have a singer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_034.wav	3.84	A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_035.wav	3.89	It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_036.wav	2.86	I'd like to continue that record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_037.wav	3.72	However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_038.wav	3.33	In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_039.wav	1.93	They're just different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_040.wav	4.61	Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_041.wav	2.56	It is not for any other purpose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_042.wav	2.39	He did not know his daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_043.wav	3.93	People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_044.wav	1.96	I was scared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_045.wav	2.39	It will come all right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_046.wav	2.52	But it took a lot of bottle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_047.wav	2.95	But it is all by design.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_048.wav	2.39	I am just going to go for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_050.wav	1.92	We need to chat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_051.wav	2.73	It is difficult for Ali.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_052.wav	3.93	The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_053.wav	3.29	A recording contract is on the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_054.wav	4.31	Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_055.wav	3.08	It has been a horrible, horrible time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_056.wav	3.03	We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_057.wav	1.88	She's a spy !
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_058.wav	2.78	What was the main difference ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_059.wav	2.22	My mother is a widow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_060.wav	2.31	And a film maker was born.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_061.wav	2.14	Art is extra.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_062.wav	2.61	Scotland had great assets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_063.wav	2.99	I've spent a lot of time on buses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_064.wav	1.96	We should have known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_065.wav	3.25	It is like a river running by my home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_066.wav	1.88	Try to save us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_067.wav	2.86	That was the easy election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_068.wav	2.90	I was as strong as a horse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_069.wav	2.65	Ferguson should take note.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_070.wav	2.69	The girls are so lucky to be alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_071.wav	2.10	Neither it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_072.wav	3.03	She died in hospital two hours later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_073.wav	1.75	It was chaotic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_074.wav	2.82	It is a job creation scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_075.wav	2.09	It works for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_076.wav	2.13	I've not thought about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_077.wav	4.65	Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_078.wav	5.04	Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_079.wav	4.61	Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_080.wav	3.97	That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_081.wav	3.12	He seems to be pleased with the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_082.wav	2.82	Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_083.wav	1.97	Someone who cares
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_084.wav	2.10	He can do everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_085.wav	2.73	By then, he was walking on water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_086.wav	4.35	It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_087.wav	3.54	Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_088.wav	2.13	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_089.wav	2.31	It is a lifeline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_090.wav	2.78	However, it did not end that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_091.wav	2.01	We must look forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_092.wav	2.82	It is an old family habit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_093.wav	2.86	Well, the big day has arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_094.wav	5.12	I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_095.wav	2.73	Until you hit the big games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_096.wav	4.01	The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_097.wav	3.50	The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_098.wav	2.26	She's got to say something.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_099.wav	3.41	He is hungry for success and I am the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_100.wav	3.80	They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_101.wav	2.56	She has so much to offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_102.wav	3.76	The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_103.wav	2.91	It is a good day for the coalition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_104.wav	2.31	We work on the same level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_105.wav	2.56	They were outside the circle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_106.wav	2.73	Two of the team became ill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_108.wav	2.56	I didn't play well last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_109.wav	2.78	Before the game we went for a pint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_110.wav	2.01	I'm not depressed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_111.wav	1.88	It is normal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_112.wav	4.10	He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_113.wav	2.48	I don't have many friends.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_114.wav	2.94	He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_115.wav	2.18	I came to complete.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_116.wav	1.62	I was angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_117.wav	2.22	They were behind the wheel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_118.wav	2.56	The fire was above the hole.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_119.wav	1.84	It's not fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_120.wav	4.57	We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_121.wav	3.50	On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_122.wav	2.31	Maybe this battle has been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_123.wav	2.05	I'm delighted about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_124.wav	1.84	I joined a group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_125.wav	1.79	It is rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_126.wav	2.48	Who would be a referee ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_127.wav	3.76	It was my own fault and I lost a lot of belief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_128.wav	3.59	The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_129.wav	4.48	An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_130.wav	3.50	Here, again, they were denied a voice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_131.wav	4.01	There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_132.wav	4.74	It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_133.wav	2.65	She really suffered for her art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_134.wav	4.31	Next season for every manager is a long time away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_135.wav	2.52	It's an amazing landscape !
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_136.wav	3.71	So the European elections are extremely important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_137.wav	2.31	He is slightly confused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_138.wav	3.12	Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_139.wav	3.20	If not, a deal could take many months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_140.wav	1.75	They took a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_141.wav	2.39	Government will intervene.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_142.wav	2.48	What will happen then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_143.wav	3.42	We never said that we would walk through the third division.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_144.wav	4.36	On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_145.wav	3.03	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_146.wav	2.65	I was the last man to touch the ball.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_147.wav	2.90	Nobody in the world can get away from him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_148.wav	2.52	Three penalties were given.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_149.wav	4.27	In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_150.wav	4.65	We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_151.wav	1.88	Who would be right ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_152.wav	2.05	We just had a go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_153.wav	4.61	He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_154.wav	5.34	Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_155.wav	4.07	He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_156.wav	5.08	Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_157.wav	4.27	It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_158.wav	2.90	The home side didn't stand a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_159.wav	4.06	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_160.wav	4.82	Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_161.wav	2.73	We also enjoyed a lot of support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_162.wav	3.54	It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_163.wav	2.22	It was by the numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_164.wav	1.84	I knew he was good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_165.wav	3.80	He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_166.wav	3.84	This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_167.wav	3.33	Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_168.wav	3.29	Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_169.wav	2.78	Was this element always there ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_170.wav	3.25	Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_171.wav	3.55	A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_172.wav	1.96	I will tell you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_173.wav	3.50	A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_174.wav	3.29	It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_175.wav	4.10	Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_176.wav	2.01	We have to move forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_177.wav	2.14	It's that sort of night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_178.wav	4.87	Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_179.wav	4.57	It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_180.wav	2.31	The post will be unpaid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_181.wav	2.44	Does that put pressure on us ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_182.wav	2.35	It is a memorial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_183.wav	4.57	It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_184.wav	2.52	They thought they had found a home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_185.wav	2.86	One season, they might do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_186.wav	2.39	Is Saddam a threat ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_187.wav	3.38	The home was now under new management.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_188.wav	2.65	He asked me in a tolerance zone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_189.wav	2.35	The hotel was now for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_190.wav	2.10	I drove the ball well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_191.wav	2.10	It is the whole package.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_192.wav	3.76	I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_193.wav	2.14	We knew nothing about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_194.wav	1.71	It is minute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_195.wav	4.70	Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_196.wav	2.99	Four policemen were wounded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_197.wav	3.07	What has caused the demise of singing ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_198.wav	4.49	Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_199.wav	2.86	Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_200.wav	3.29	I've got good news and bad news for you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_201.wav	3.71	We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_202.wav	2.43	People will ask about us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_203.wav	4.23	The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_204.wav	2.69	Last night was a key episode.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_205.wav	4.52	Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_206.wav	2.18	It wasn't to be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_207.wav	2.99	I wanted to put myself on the line.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_209.wav	2.44	I came home by ambulance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_210.wav	5.12	It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_211.wav	2.35	It's the same old story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_212.wav	2.90	But we are not immune to the problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_213.wav	4.31	He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_214.wav	4.74	The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_215.wav	3.12	The procedures were not in place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_216.wav	2.69	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_217.wav	4.14	We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_218.wav	4.14	After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_219.wav	2.65	Saddam Hussein is a devil.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_220.wav	3.08	That is an important part of our role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_221.wav	2.61	She should not be blamed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_222.wav	4.83	We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_223.wav	2.48	I am delighted for Simon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_224.wav	2.82	I had decided to quit the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_225.wav	2.99	The FBI could become involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_226.wav	4.70	However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_227.wav	4.10	For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_228.wav	4.01	On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_229.wav	4.82	The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_230.wav	2.39	Who was on the panel ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_231.wav	2.10	We've got the bronze.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_232.wav	2.05	Saturday is gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_233.wav	4.06	At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_234.wav	2.52	If it doesn't, it doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_235.wav	2.48	The boy is no longer with us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_236.wav	4.01	The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_237.wav	2.99	The track is currently covered in snow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_238.wav	3.93	I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_239.wav	4.57	You should always be able to get out in some direction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_240.wav	1.97	We are so proud.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_241.wav	2.69	We were a load of rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_242.wav	3.63	The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_243.wav	1.79	It's an idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_244.wav	4.14	On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_245.wav	3.37	The sanctions are about collective punishment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_246.wav	3.67	We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_247.wav	3.76	The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_248.wav	3.21	The problem in Norway is outside the National.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_249.wav	2.44	The letters are going out today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_250.wav	1.84	It's only fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_251.wav	2.86	Chambers said he would accept the place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_252.wav	4.01	Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_253.wav	4.19	It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_254.wav	2.26	It was a hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_255.wav	4.10	A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_256.wav	2.48	This year I understood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_257.wav	3.72	He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_258.wav	2.39	Kirkwood was arrested.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_259.wav	1.88	This is a big club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_260.wav	4.36	That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_261.wav	2.52	I was happily surprised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_262.wav	2.22	They must play for each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_263.wav	2.69	The pensioners did not want to know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_264.wav	3.80	He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_265.wav	3.80	Today we can say that a new era has begun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_266.wav	2.52	That is highly unfair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_267.wav	2.31	The warning is timely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_268.wav	4.87	Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_269.wav	4.23	That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_270.wav	2.35	They are never here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_271.wav	4.48	I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_272.wav	2.90	He was also married with two children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_273.wav	3.67	It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_274.wav	1.84	We're in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_275.wav	2.95	Our objective is to tackle poverty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_277.wav	1.96	It's a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_278.wav	3.72	She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_279.wav	4.06	He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_280.wav	2.69	I am an estate agent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_281.wav	2.22	People have no choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_282.wav	2.65	They were on holiday in Egypt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_283.wav	2.78	It was a privilege to work for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_284.wav	3.46	In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_285.wav	2.56	If not, he should go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_286.wav	3.55	For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_287.wav	2.31	I saw it at a ruck.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_288.wav	2.31	I felt like I was a child.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_289.wav	2.95	What would be the timetable for withdrawal ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_290.wav	3.76	The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_292.wav	1.97	We have other options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_293.wav	3.58	I do not think this family will ever get over this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_294.wav	3.20	It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_295.wav	2.44	These figures are truly awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_296.wav	2.48	Sunday's game was not a trial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_297.wav	2.69	Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_298.wav	3.84	The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_300.wav	2.69	I was brought up in a mining background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_301.wav	2.57	I thought it was my only chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_302.wav	4.65	Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_303.wav	4.61	The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_304.wav	3.54	The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_305.wav	2.48	There is no openness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_306.wav	2.48	This is a war over our home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_307.wav	3.97	In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_308.wav	2.48	It's just not funny !
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_309.wav	4.01	It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_310.wav	4.95	The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_311.wav	2.26	You are the glory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_312.wav	4.31	However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_313.wav	3.63	Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_314.wav	2.22	It's certainly different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_315.wav	3.55	O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_316.wav	2.65	This is the culture change in medicine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_318.wav	2.39	It's about my time as a guitarist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_319.wav	3.71	There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_320.wav	2.01	It's not even finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_322.wav	1.79	It should be equal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_323.wav	4.10	Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_324.wav	2.99	We are very strongly behind the bid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_325.wav	3.80	In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_326.wav	2.13	I am very happy to be here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_328.wav	2.86	It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_329.wav	5.04	On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_330.wav	2.22	It could have gone either way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_331.wav	2.56	He was then replaced by Ross.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_332.wav	2.35	I'd like to take the plunge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_333.wav	2.48	She did not attend the courtroom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_334.wav	3.42	It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_335.wav	2.18	He told the court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_336.wav	2.95	The team for the first game could be this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_337.wav	2.05	They haven't got a hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_338.wav	2.43	It has moved on in the last week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_339.wav	2.86	Gaelic provision continued to be good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_340.wav	1.88	He did a good job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_341.wav	2.90	I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_342.wav	2.18	Today she has been released.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_343.wav	2.48	These days are long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_344.wav	3.16	They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_345.wav	3.80	But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_346.wav	2.22	Indeed, it was magical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_347.wav	1.97	I've got no secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_348.wav	2.14	Look at the witnesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_349.wav	3.50	The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_350.wav	1.62	I'm very lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_351.wav	2.73	They may yet have the last laugh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_352.wav	1.88	Everything was an effort.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_353.wav	4.78	This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_354.wav	2.99	Like his acting, it was an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_355.wav	1.88	It is long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_356.wav	2.43	It's the last thing on my mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_357.wav	1.80	Tell us about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_358.wav	2.56	There is a cup final at stake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_359.wav	2.90	That is a break with tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_360.wav	2.01	It was very formal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_361.wav	3.59	They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_362.wav	3.37	In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_363.wav	2.22	It benefits the whole family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_364.wav	2.13	It was fit for royalty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_365.wav	2.14	We are looking for perfection.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_366.wav	4.06	It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_367.wav	3.84	The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_368.wav	1.93	I am a star.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_369.wav	3.54	We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_370.wav	2.26	He could make it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_371.wav	3.33	He later became a respected High Court judge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_373.wav	2.99	For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_374.wav	2.78	It is not too late to get on board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_376.wav	2.86	It is a simple equation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_377.wav	2.31	Talks are progressing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_378.wav	2.09	They play together perfectly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_379.wav	1.67	It's a long process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_380.wav	4.61	Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_381.wav	2.56	It does not even have a staff shortage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_382.wav	3.54	However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_384.wav	3.37	It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_386.wav	2.69	Three years ago he would have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_387.wav	3.16	That team is due to be announced this morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_388.wav	2.52	It has been a lovely family occasion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_389.wav	2.31	That's the name of the game, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_390.wav	2.73	There were no casualties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_391.wav	3.84	A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p229\p229_392.wav	2.48	Yet the data is compelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_001.wav	2.22	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_002.wav	4.52	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_003.wav	7.98	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_005.wav	7.85	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_006.wav	6.66	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_007.wav	5.42	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_008.wav	9.18	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_009.wav	5.08	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_010.wav	3.08	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_012.wav	4.31	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_013.wav	5.12	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_014.wav	5.89	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_016.wav	9.00	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_017.wav	3.97	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_018.wav	6.32	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_019.wav	10.41	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_020.wav	4.52	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_021.wav	11.26	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_023.wav	15.07	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_024.wav	8.54	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_025.wav	2.35	It is on the internet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_026.wav	3.29	Smoking is also very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_027.wav	4.05	He has the courage of the unaware.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_028.wav	2.99	Life was like a timetable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_029.wav	3.51	It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_030.wav	4.91	Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_031.wav	3.07	I'm so happy that she did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_032.wav	2.78	The wedding was in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_033.wav	4.65	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_034.wav	2.82	He really is a lovely man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_035.wav	4.01	The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_036.wav	3.63	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_037.wav	2.74	The boy is no longer with us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_038.wav	3.16	They said she was stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_039.wav	3.63	This will save interest charges.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_040.wav	3.25	Well, he is an artist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_041.wav	2.74	He looks like an Afghan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_042.wav	2.86	People want to see me on the screen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_043.wav	3.20	The big problem is the lack of grass.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_044.wav	2.69	That was the theory, anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_045.wav	4.14	I was inspired by two things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_046.wav	2.99	If not, he should go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_047.wav	3.03	I must take a seat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_048.wav	2.74	It was bound to happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_049.wav	4.27	We have to bring in new players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_050.wav	4.95	In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_051.wav	3.12	I have made that offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_052.wav	3.63	None has ever been found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_053.wav	3.63	Four other charges were dropped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_054.wav	2.78	We should be able to cope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_055.wav	5.47	There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_056.wav	3.03	We will pay their bills.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_057.wav	4.10	You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_058.wav	2.82	It was exactly four months away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_059.wav	3.46	He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_060.wav	3.97	It's not covered by the insurance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_061.wav	3.33	But the challenge is in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_062.wav	3.38	Robin Williams is very subdued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_063.wav	3.29	The tournament has now been cancelled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_064.wav	4.87	They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_065.wav	3.54	Both sides have been hit by injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_066.wav	4.14	He also received a medal of honour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_068.wav	5.59	It may be that lifestyle is behind it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_069.wav	4.83	It is a job creation scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_070.wav	2.31	It looks like a hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_071.wav	1.88	What do we do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_072.wav	2.77	Why do it otherwise ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_073.wav	3.67	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_074.wav	6.06	However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_075.wav	4.95	After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_076.wav	2.69	Consumer confidence remains an issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_077.wav	3.20	Last week, he was taken into hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_078.wav	2.69	This is a true story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_079.wav	3.07	By then, he was walking on water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_080.wav	2.05	It's so hard to shift.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_081.wav	2.18	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_083.wav	2.73	It might change your life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_084.wav	3.67	You are a great player.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_085.wav	2.99	However, it did not end that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_086.wav	3.55	We will deal with the refugees.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_087.wav	3.55	It was not an insult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_088.wav	3.03	You might not make it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_089.wav	5.34	However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_090.wav	4.74	I did not have a bet on myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_091.wav	2.78	The conclusion is the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_092.wav	2.48	He was prepared for this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_093.wav	2.43	But I know the course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_094.wav	2.56	You are like an animal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_095.wav	2.86	We intend to change the model.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_096.wav	6.40	It was some time before she found out he was safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_097.wav	3.76	Two of the team became ill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_099.wav	5.42	It has been a nightmare of frustration.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_100.wav	5.16	But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_101.wav	3.58	Before the game we went for a pint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_102.wav	3.16	This was a good move for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_103.wav	5.72	It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_104.wav	4.57	I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_105.wav	1.91	It is close to call.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_106.wav	3.54	It is an impressive record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_107.wav	4.35	It is a total and utter change of culture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_108.wav	4.06	He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_109.wav	3.72	Abbey National is an option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_110.wav	5.81	The arrival of the Scottish Premier League has also presented a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_112.wav	2.95	We have the mental strength.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_113.wav	3.16	You can spend money on housing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_114.wav	3.46	That admission is not surprising.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_115.wav	3.93	I can't even get into the A team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_116.wav	4.99	Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_117.wav	3.97	Which can happen any time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_118.wav	4.23	It is too pretty, it is too small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_119.wav	4.36	But this time we can have no excuses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_120.wav	4.23	They are very happy with the new settlement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_121.wav	4.06	The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_122.wav	3.76	Something will be done by corporate bodies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_123.wav	3.59	We did what we had to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_124.wav	4.01	She was also very brave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_125.wav	5.12	On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_126.wav	4.01	We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_127.wav	2.95	The opposite is the case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_128.wav	2.31	He was a home referee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_129.wav	3.97	This is a successful outcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_130.wav	4.91	Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_131.wav	3.33	She died at her home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_132.wav	5.38	Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_133.wav	4.40	Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_134.wav	3.12	It was a piece of art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_135.wav	2.95	I would relish the prospect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_137.wav	3.37	These men are a part of India.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_138.wav	2.99	I was caught out a little bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_139.wav	6.06	The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_140.wav	4.10	I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_141.wav	2.05	It has to be an event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_142.wav	3.59	It was deployed in the Gulf War.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_143.wav	3.97	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_144.wav	5.46	The first thing is to assess the damage that has been done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_145.wav	2.99	She has gone to the Catholic school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_146.wav	3.37	It was by the numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_147.wav	4.31	I am not going to make any further comment, apart from that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_148.wav	4.70	This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_149.wav	4.82	However, he was later released without charge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_150.wav	3.46	This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_151.wav	2.99	These days are long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_152.wav	2.73	I'm afraid to say anything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_153.wav	2.74	We are still getting over it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_154.wav	2.69	It has to be now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_155.wav	3.20	It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_156.wav	4.74	You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_157.wav	2.99	They will do their own thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_158.wav	2.86	You had to go and see him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_159.wav	3.33	So what is the campaign about ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_160.wav	2.48	And does it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_161.wav	2.91	Are you from the rugby ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_162.wav	2.48	Had I heard ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_163.wav	4.36	Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_164.wav	3.29	Our position remains the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_165.wav	2.78	Nobody did in those days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_166.wav	3.41	We believe in the medium term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_167.wav	2.13	It's nice to be nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_168.wav	5.29	To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_169.wav	4.82	On the month the weakness was across the board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_170.wav	2.74	One season, they might do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_171.wav	5.08	Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_172.wav	4.31	First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_173.wav	3.54	But he has a lifeline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_174.wav	3.63	Phase one was a shambles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_175.wav	4.82	City sentiment is in his favour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_176.wav	4.95	I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_177.wav	5.08	At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_178.wav	2.60	Tomorrow is a new day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_179.wav	3.33	It makes no influence on the public.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_180.wav	2.52	She has left the island.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_181.wav	3.16	He played it like a veteran.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_182.wav	3.67	I have spoken to head office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_183.wav	2.39	They will run a mile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_184.wav	4.74	It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_185.wav	4.05	Our destiny is in our own hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_186.wav	2.73	He prefers to play for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_188.wav	2.82	He lives in a neighbouring village.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_189.wav	3.89	It was an odd affair, in many respects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_190.wav	5.25	It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_191.wav	4.44	We represent a wide range of society.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_192.wav	3.24	We always felt we could win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_194.wav	4.61	This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_195.wav	5.72	It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_196.wav	4.44	Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_198.wav	2.69	I made a terrible start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_199.wav	3.80	The result is called a patent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_200.wav	3.54	We played them off the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_201.wav	4.02	Racism has no place in any sport.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_202.wav	2.78	Tommy is not a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_203.wav	4.23	The sanctions are about collective punishment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_204.wav	2.86	This is a holy place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_205.wav	2.86	He had suffered a heart attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_206.wav	3.97	The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_207.wav	4.48	We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_208.wav	2.73	This will take several weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_209.wav	4.27	The research is published in the journal, Nature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_210.wav	4.40	We have an election in eight days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_211.wav	6.66	Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_212.wav	1.92	There is no quick fix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_213.wav	3.38	All will be revealed in due course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_214.wav	3.63	We used to live with dignity in our country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_215.wav	4.10	The most exciting room is the final one of the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_216.wav	3.63	He has made his base in Spain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_217.wav	2.73	My life is in the ballet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_218.wav	4.99	Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_219.wav	2.99	It's all change at Kilmarnock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_220.wav	3.55	His second was a beauty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_221.wav	2.69	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_222.wav	2.48	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_223.wav	3.33	How do you get it back ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_224.wav	3.80	What are you not good at ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_225.wav	3.59	The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_226.wav	4.06	However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_227.wav	2.18	It was a day for records.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_228.wav	4.18	He remains a main board director of Royal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_230.wav	3.46	That has been the easy part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_231.wav	3.63	Things were so intense in the studio.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_232.wav	3.24	I was not sure whether I had won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_233.wav	3.37	If it doesn't, it doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_234.wav	3.76	So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_235.wav	2.95	It is the voice of the survivors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_236.wav	3.37	It had so much to do with output.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_237.wav	3.37	Must have been at the bar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_238.wav	2.91	She died in middle age.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_239.wav	5.04	No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_240.wav	3.20	They need to win a trophy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_241.wav	4.83	Half the young people had had contact with the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_242.wav	3.88	It is possible to be too good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_243.wav	4.02	In many ways, that is as important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_244.wav	2.61	Here is a question for you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_245.wav	2.52	I was just a kid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_246.wav	4.27	Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_247.wav	3.29	Hospitals are for the ill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_248.wav	5.12	However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_249.wav	5.34	Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_250.wav	3.63	We have to compete at our own level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_251.wav	2.94	They showed a lot of heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_252.wav	3.84	This gives a financial incentive to switch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_253.wav	3.63	It might be sad, but it's a fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_254.wav	3.63	She took them for a term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_255.wav	3.25	Kingfisher can afford to wait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_257.wav	3.80	Nato was not a love affair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_258.wav	4.57	Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_259.wav	5.76	Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_260.wav	3.50	In fact, we were all over the shop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_261.wav	2.82	You can feel at home in China.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_262.wav	2.90	Persuaded to change his mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_263.wav	5.38	Either way, the investor retains the premium.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_264.wav	5.34	It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_265.wav	5.89	In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_266.wav	3.54	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_267.wav	3.20	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_268.wav	5.04	Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_269.wav	4.95	I've had no discussions with the chairman of the board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_270.wav	3.07	I was ready for this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_271.wav	3.85	On the contrary they stand to gain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_272.wav	4.35	They are interior designers and architects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_273.wav	4.44	That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_274.wav	3.38	We feel very good about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_276.wav	6.44	It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_277.wav	3.37	It is also very valuable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_278.wav	4.06	None of this work is guaranteed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_279.wav	2.86	There is a case to answer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_280.wav	4.35	We're trying to get rounded performers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_281.wav	4.06	They can leave at any time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_282.wav	2.73	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_283.wav	3.59	was everything done to save people ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_284.wav	4.66	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_285.wav	3.63	Do I think about them often ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_286.wav	4.48	That was a gold medal for certain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_287.wav	3.54	You get a lot for your money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_288.wav	5.76	Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_289.wav	3.33	In that moment, I was happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_290.wav	3.49	The actor has met with Mandela.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_291.wav	4.91	It was never a free kick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_292.wav	3.89	It is a recipe for success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_293.wav	3.84	I would rather look at him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_295.wav	4.36	It's got to come from me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_296.wav	3.24	It took a month and a half to film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_297.wav	4.10	The cause of the accident remained unclear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_298.wav	3.80	It is a symbolic concert.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_299.wav	6.44	There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_300.wav	3.67	Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_302.wav	3.59	He is at war with his knee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_303.wav	4.65	Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_304.wav	2.99	I was there five months ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_305.wav	3.16	You have to see it like this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_306.wav	3.80	Rugby is now just like football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_307.wav	3.37	It could well be military.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_308.wav	3.20	His job was not advertised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_309.wav	5.04	There is an element of racism in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_310.wav	2.86	We have a clean bill of health.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_311.wav	3.29	And we can do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_312.wav	2.65	The songs are just so good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_313.wav	3.84	The casting is as perfect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_314.wav	2.77	I can hardly believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_315.wav	3.76	I must do something about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_316.wav	6.02	Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_317.wav	5.08	If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_318.wav	2.90	They are not left wing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_319.wav	4.99	McNaughton was not so sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_321.wav	3.97	It is a road of death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_322.wav	3.50	The party lasted all night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_323.wav	5.98	The group is not paying a dividend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_324.wav	2.65	We were on our way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_325.wav	2.91	I was as strong as a horse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_326.wav	2.95	That meant the search was unlawful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_327.wav	4.48	We have a good healthy debate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_328.wav	3.50	I would do away with the dress code.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_329.wav	4.31	We are on a four-year mission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_330.wav	3.37	This is a historic occasion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_331.wav	2.99	This ruling is a farce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_332.wav	3.25	I can see their argument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_333.wav	3.16	After some discussion they did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_334.wav	2.01	It was always an option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_335.wav	3.12	Does that put pressure on us ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_336.wav	1.67	Did it work ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_337.wav	4.91	Do you think we are a top nation ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_338.wav	3.84	Public opinion was split on the proposal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_339.wav	3.93	The election is total confusion and chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_340.wav	2.91	You may have a short memory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_341.wav	5.33	Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_342.wav	3.33	In the old days, it was easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_343.wav	3.03	There was some merit in that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_344.wav	4.61	That is a trend which will be encouraged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_345.wav	3.29	The airport was even different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_346.wav	4.61	Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_347.wav	4.61	We think all other measures are not exhausted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_348.wav	2.94	There was no time scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_349.wav	3.42	Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_350.wav	5.51	On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_351.wav	2.95	He is not very big, either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_352.wav	2.90	I have a moral dilemma.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_353.wav	3.29	Even the one she loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_354.wav	4.01	You have no chance of planning permission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_355.wav	3.07	We are encouraged by the news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_356.wav	4.66	In addition, certain areas closed at certain times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_357.wav	3.06	The professor said the results were positive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_358.wav	3.50	In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_359.wav	3.12	Three years ago he would have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_360.wav	5.12	Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_361.wav	6.02	The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_362.wav	2.61	I am a lucky man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_363.wav	2.77	Nobody else was with me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_364.wav	3.54	We put our bid in last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_365.wav	4.14	Alex Ferguson is the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_366.wav	4.31	George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_367.wav	3.97	But BA said the prediction was premature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_368.wav	4.74	Like his acting, it was an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_369.wav	3.03	They have broken the promise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_370.wav	3.84	We are really good friends.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_371.wav	2.56	My goal is quite simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_372.wav	3.33	This is a major championship.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_373.wav	2.52	It's going to be fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_374.wav	4.57	She is now on the back benches.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_375.wav	4.27	Scrutiny by European Parliament is limited.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_376.wav	4.02	This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_377.wav	4.78	Both of those promises have already been honoured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_378.wav	2.78	We are a Scottish company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_379.wav	2.52	We will win the argument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_380.wav	3.89	Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_381.wav	4.27	It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_382.wav	3.18	I always knew she was funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_383.wav	3.50	He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_384.wav	3.63	The marshall at the turn was great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_385.wav	2.39	If you can get it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_386.wav	4.36	On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_387.wav	4.01	There was a substantial explosion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_388.wav	4.52	The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_389.wav	2.86	He could face a jail sentence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_390.wav	5.38	That is the consistent approach of the Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_391.wav	4.44	This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_392.wav	3.03	Clark is back on top form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_393.wav	5.51	Motion described it as a unique event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_394.wav	3.84	I had a fortunate war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_395.wav	2.22	Are they free ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_396.wav	2.01	What are they for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_397.wav	2.95	Is there a waiting list ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_398.wav	3.12	Do they think anyone else wants them ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_399.wav	4.27	That investment has now been secured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_400.wav	2.31	It is a large number.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_401.wav	2.73	You will not feel a thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_402.wav	3.25	I've never seen a game like it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_404.wav	4.01	It does not even have a staff shortage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_405.wav	3.16	It was a bank holiday, after all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_406.wav	3.20	We're obviously disturbed by this case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_407.wav	2.82	The casualties were not named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_408.wav	4.70	It is a temptation which should be resisted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_409.wav	1.93	It had been on the cards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_410.wav	2.39	The second goal was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_411.wav	3.84	Treatment is not an issue with these people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_413.wav	5.38	Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_414.wav	3.46	It is the old story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_415.wav	3.03	This should put downward pressure on inflation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_416.wav	4.01	No date has been set for a meeting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p230\p230_417.wav	4.95	We have to build a new team in the minimum of time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_001.wav	2.14	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_002.wav	3.25	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_003.wav	5.76	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_004.wav	4.01	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_005.wav	4.81	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_006.wav	4.53	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_007.wav	3.85	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_008.wav	6.44	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_009.wav	4.31	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_010.wav	2.65	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_011.wav	6.23	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_012.wav	3.84	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_013.wav	3.67	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_014.wav	4.23	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_015.wav	4.86	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_016.wav	5.76	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_017.wav	3.07	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_018.wav	4.78	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_019.wav	6.32	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_020.wav	3.84	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_021.wav	7.30	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_023.wav	9.35	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_024.wav	5.55	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_025.wav	3.42	On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_026.wav	2.18	I'd just like to play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_027.wav	2.18	Because we do not need it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_028.wav	2.01	There was a rush of water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_029.wav	3.29	Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_030.wav	1.97	That deal is a joke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_031.wav	2.56	The Premier League has been a huge success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_032.wav	3.80	If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_033.wav	2.09	It carried a double message.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_034.wav	2.22	That means an extra two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_035.wav	2.31	I became a widow overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_036.wav	2.05	But he can turn on the charm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_037.wav	2.94	You must always attempt to raise the bar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_038.wav	2.22	The man became a reporter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_039.wav	3.67	Mr Blair last night attended his weekly audience with the Queen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_040.wav	2.09	Last year, I was pretty bad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_041.wav	2.69	Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_042.wav	2.27	Among them are many criminals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_043.wav	2.35	He looks like an Afghan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_044.wav	3.63	He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_045.wav	1.92	I guess I was lucky, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_046.wav	1.96	I was inspired by two things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_047.wav	1.71	A win is a win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_048.wav	1.80	There was no safety net.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_049.wav	1.97	There's nothing we could do about this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_050.wav	1.55	It is a symbolic concert.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_051.wav	1.88	We keep an eye on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_052.wav	1.22	We have not given up hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_053.wav	2.65	The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_054.wav	1.93	She said she was really sorry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_055.wav	2.86	In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_056.wav	2.48	Italy is a beautiful place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_057.wav	2.35	Four other charges were dropped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_058.wav	1.97	We should be able to cope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_059.wav	2.22	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_061.wav	2.22	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_062.wav	1.54	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_063.wav	1.84	What do we do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_064.wav	1.88	It was a lovely experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_065.wav	3.59	The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_066.wav	2.22	We will pay their bills.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_067.wav	2.18	Only water is currently allowed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_068.wav	3.16	He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_069.wav	2.31	We need to increase the membership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_070.wav	2.48	This is an exciting new venture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_071.wav	2.31	He highlighted a lack of staff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_072.wav	2.31	Then followed a bout of flu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_073.wav	2.69	Both sides have been hit by injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_074.wav	2.73	Both men were on one-year contracts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_076.wav	2.05	That would be too easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_078.wav	3.16	After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_079.wav	3.03	Both agreed on the success of the event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_080.wav	2.99	Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_081.wav	2.78	On Saturday, it was much the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_082.wav	2.26	It's so hard to shift.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_083.wav	2.13	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_085.wav	2.52	However, it did not end that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_086.wav	2.65	Strathclyde Police declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_087.wav	3.03	It is an old family habit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_088.wav	2.05	He's been hit by it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_089.wav	3.25	However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_090.wav	1.92	I saw the whole thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_091.wav	2.01	But I know the course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_092.wav	1.92	Their attitude is all wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_093.wav	2.05	We must stop it with the golf ball.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_094.wav	2.01	You are like an animal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_095.wav	2.77	This is the logic of punishment assaults.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_097.wav	2.42	We should recognise others have done a good job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_098.wav	2.73	We live by the rule of law.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_099.wav	2.56	Two of the team became ill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_100.wav	2.61	No, the equipment is extra.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_101.wav	2.90	That time is not now, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_102.wav	2.18	It's not a quick fix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_103.wav	2.35	Why do it otherwise ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_104.wav	2.91	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_105.wav	1.88	So, did she meet him ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_106.wav	2.48	So what is the campaign about ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_107.wav	1.75	And does it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_108.wav	2.65	Before the game we went for a pint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_109.wav	3.16	We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_110.wav	2.31	You'd better believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_111.wav	2.14	New Year will be very busy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_112.wav	2.18	There's still plenty time left.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_113.wav	2.56	It proved a good decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_114.wav	1.71	Maybe this battle has been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_115.wav	2.43	January is a bad time of year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_116.wav	2.94	I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_117.wav	3.16	It is much as it has been described.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_118.wav	2.44	Then again, we could have.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_119.wav	2.35	It is a delight on every level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_120.wav	2.52	There were no grounds for his action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_121.wav	2.22	I was just a child.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_122.wav	2.14	We should not be surprised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_123.wav	2.99	It was not a finale he would want to remember.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_124.wav	2.86	Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_125.wav	2.05	That period was a struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_126.wav	2.52	It is too pretty, it is too small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_127.wav	2.31	This should begin in October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_128.wav	2.48	That is far too high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_129.wav	2.69	If not, a deal could take many months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_130.wav	2.69	It plans to return to this field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_131.wav	2.52	They made such decisions in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_132.wav	2.69	Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_133.wav	1.92	It is a common problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_134.wav	1.96	You're a gambling man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_135.wav	2.78	We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_136.wav	2.52	He is a great addition to our team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_137.wav	2.48	This is a successful outcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_138.wav	3.29	In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_139.wav	2.78	Put yourself in the position of being a referee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_140.wav	2.69	I think he's the favourite, no question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_141.wav	2.65	I miss the freedom that I had.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_142.wav	2.56	It only increased the support for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_143.wav	2.44	Anyone can do the sums.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_144.wav	3.33	Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_145.wav	2.82	It opens the door to the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_146.wav	2.27	It has become a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_147.wav	2.39	The whole industry is a shambles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_148.wav	2.31	There's only one team in Ayrshire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_149.wav	2.43	It was deployed in the Gulf War.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_150.wav	2.56	We have a clean bill of health.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_151.wav	2.52	It is not normal practice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_152.wav	3.50	The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_153.wav	2.31	He was asked to quit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_154.wav	2.65	A new school will be built.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_155.wav	2.99	The strong pound also took its toll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_156.wav	2.27	It is a terrible tragedy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_157.wav	3.20	He was right into football from an early age.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_158.wav	2.14	It is not like us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_159.wav	2.35	What happened in that game ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_160.wav	1.97	Are you going to win ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_161.wav	1.71	Was it the wife ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_162.wav	1.54	Why change it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_163.wav	2.31	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_164.wav	2.35	He was in great spirits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_165.wav	2.05	We have a budget in March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_166.wav	2.22	You've been a great audience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_167.wav	1.92	It is simply not true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_168.wav	2.39	Well, this article is a bit like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_169.wav	2.31	It is really good news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_170.wav	2.14	We've made a couple of albums.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_171.wav	3.42	To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_172.wav	2.27	My life has been destroyed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_173.wav	2.43	I always felt they played for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_174.wav	2.35	One season, they might do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_175.wav	2.99	First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_176.wav	2.01	This much I can tell you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_177.wav	2.48	The Hibs manager is no fool.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_178.wav	2.43	We are the gateway to justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_179.wav	2.18	But one was not enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_180.wav	2.01	I have spoken to head office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_181.wav	2.27	I am not ready to walk away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_183.wav	2.86	The shooting created panic in the street.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_184.wav	2.39	So many people will be affected by this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_185.wav	2.57	As many as the market will support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_186.wav	2.69	They need to look after themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_188.wav	1.81	This is the time to use it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_189.wav	2.13	You know the sort of thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_190.wav	2.65	I'm interested in interesting work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_191.wav	2.90	We represent a wide range of society.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_192.wav	2.09	People will ask about us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_193.wav	3.03	Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_194.wav	2.61	This should put downward pressure on inflation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_195.wav	4.05	On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_196.wav	2.18	I came home by ambulance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_197.wav	2.01	I suggest a new plan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_198.wav	2.56	It was a moment of madness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_199.wav	3.50	Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_200.wav	2.48	Libya is an easy target.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_201.wav	1.84	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_202.wav	1.97	how do you get it back ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_203.wav	2.01	What are you no good at ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_205.wav	2.05	Who was she ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_206.wav	2.18	It gave no further details.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_207.wav	2.61	You've caught a serial killer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_208.wav	2.82	I won't make an official complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_209.wav	2.09	We are a new department.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_210.wav	1.97	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_211.wav	2.31	They are looking at flotation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_212.wav	2.57	Which isn't a bad idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_213.wav	2.56	We have an election in eight days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_214.wav	2.86	He also presented You Bet!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_215.wav	2.22	That might help a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_216.wav	2.56	I had decided to quit the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_217.wav	2.10	He has a lot of skill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_218.wav	3.03	I've wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_219.wav	3.42	However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_220.wav	2.77	And the World Cup has not even begun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_221.wav	2.86	The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_222.wav	2.05	That you can do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_223.wav	2.90	It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_224.wav	3.37	They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_225.wav	2.65	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_226.wav	3.55	This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_228.wav	2.48	We played them off the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_229.wav	2.69	So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_230.wav	2.65	They are the innocent victims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_231.wav	2.65	Paterson can afford to be generous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_232.wav	1.92	She died in middle age.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_233.wav	2.35	I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_234.wav	1.79	It is set in Paris.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_235.wav	2.48	The irony was not lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_236.wav	2.35	Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_237.wav	2.35	Hospitals are for the ill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_238.wav	2.22	The minister is the engineer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_239.wav	2.35	My future is in the marathon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_240.wav	2.01	It is now the big brother.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_241.wav	2.18	The parties have no contact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_242.wav	2.35	She took them for a term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_243.wav	2.22	Nato was not a love affair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_244.wav	1.96	He is due in Israel tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_245.wav	2.35	You can feel at home in China.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_246.wav	2.60	His is a global perspective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_247.wav	2.56	Persuaded to change his mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_248.wav	2.99	Either way, the investor retains the premium.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_249.wav	2.14	This ruling is a farce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_250.wav	2.31	The baby deserves the credit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_251.wav	2.52	Washington is consumed by the crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_252.wav	2.48	But they were never expected to last.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_253.wav	2.09	It was a cry for help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_254.wav	3.29	No production contract is yet in sight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_255.wav	3.03	Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_256.wav	3.72	A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_257.wav	2.60	He admitted that he knew nothing about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_258.wav	2.52	It seems a shame to leave it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_259.wav	2.52	It was the climax of the thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_260.wav	2.27	The concerns are the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_261.wav	1.75	I can't get a job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_262.wav	2.44	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_263.wav	2.73	was everything done to save people ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_264.wav	2.95	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_265.wav	2.82	Do I think about them often ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_266.wav	2.27	Is it in the right place ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_267.wav	1.97	Did he trip ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_268.wav	2.35	I've had the time of my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_269.wav	3.42	The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_270.wav	2.61	On the contrary they stand to gain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_271.wav	2.14	I thought he might have been a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_272.wav	3.63	This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_273.wav	2.18	I'd never run for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_274.wav	2.86	It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_275.wav	2.95	It does not work that way in Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_276.wav	2.39	These figures are truly terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_277.wav	3.07	Share prices have fallen for three years in a row.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_278.wav	2.44	The joint bid is still on course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_279.wav	2.61	At first I thought I was gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_280.wav	3.46	The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_281.wav	1.84	They can leave at any time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_282.wav	2.43	That view has not altered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_283.wav	1.88	You get a lot for your money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_284.wav	2.74	Blair also had a penalty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_285.wav	3.03	It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_286.wav	2.43	Frankly, we should all have such problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_288.wav	3.63	The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_289.wav	2.73	She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_290.wav	2.35	They were on holiday in Egypt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_291.wav	3.54	It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_292.wav	2.14	I've lost all confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_293.wav	2.31	This could be a mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_294.wav	2.48	Once again, they would be wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_295.wav	3.97	There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_296.wav	3.20	It's all designed to speed up the service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_297.wav	2.48	He will address the nation this evening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_298.wav	3.08	They have shown a great desire and attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_299.wav	2.86	I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_300.wav	2.05	But it is up again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_301.wav	3.55	Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_302.wav	2.22	It could well be military.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_303.wav	2.39	I was just so determined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_304.wav	2.26	That was the difference between the sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_305.wav	2.22	The judge was really nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_307.wav	2.14	You are a different people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_308.wav	2.52	Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_309.wav	1.88	He is still in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_310.wav	2.39	McNaughton was not so sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_312.wav	2.31	I thought it was my only chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_313.wav	2.14	I thought he did very well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_314.wav	2.44	I'm not making any comment at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_315.wav	3.50	Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_316.wav	2.82	We're on our way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_317.wav	3.38	They come to enjoy themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_318.wav	2.65	That meant the search was unlawful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_319.wav	4.44	They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_320.wav	3.50	However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_322.wav	2.22	We want to play at the worlds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_323.wav	3.72	However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_324.wav	2.73	We have got no money to go anywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_325.wav	1.92	Have a look at this lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_326.wav	3.42	That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_327.wav	2.48	The king is delighted by the honour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_328.wav	3.55	It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_329.wav	3.03	The problems began a long time ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_330.wav	2.61	I am not sure about the rate of progress.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_331.wav	3.03	To beat the European champion is quite nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_332.wav	2.44	In the old days, it was easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_333.wav	2.43	However, the groups denied the claims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_334.wav	2.31	She is now on the back benches.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_336.wav	2.14	I think it's about time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_337.wav	2.22	The airport was even different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_338.wav	2.18	There was no time scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_339.wav	3.07	In his absence, the council adopted the change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_340.wav	2.82	At first, the youngster was not keen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_341.wav	3.54	The figures are bad, but not that bad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_342.wav	2.95	Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_343.wav	3.88	Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_344.wav	2.52	He was then replaced by Ross.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_345.wav	2.35	Finally came the moment of truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_346.wav	2.26	We are encouraged by the news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_347.wav	2.05	What form did that take ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_348.wav	1.62	Are they free ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_349.wav	1.58	What are they for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_350.wav	1.80	Is there a waiting list ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_351.wav	2.39	Do they think anyone else wants them ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_352.wav	1.88	So what happens next ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_353.wav	2.39	The units will not be replaced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_354.wav	2.94	Neither man has been charged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_355.wav	2.86	Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_357.wav	2.22	Look at the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_358.wav	1.97	I am a lucky man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_359.wav	2.31	But they have taken the lesson to heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_360.wav	2.05	I've always been a sensitive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_361.wav	2.18	Glasgow is a friendly city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_362.wav	1.79	You did not see it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_363.wav	1.88	We live on an island.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_364.wav	2.05	It is not real life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_365.wav	2.09	Neither woman has been named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_366.wav	2.69	They should take their mobile phones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_367.wav	2.22	You need a licence to run a pub.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_368.wav	2.99	We regret that they're brought in the first place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_369.wav	3.25	Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_370.wav	2.22	This is a major championship.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_371.wav	2.52	The result is called a patent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_372.wav	2.27	But we finished the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_373.wav	3.37	They were to blame for the first two goals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_374.wav	2.14	There is no deal as yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_375.wav	2.65	Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_376.wav	1.92	We were given a break.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_377.wav	2.39	In due course the deal was done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_378.wav	2.35	to have products for their needs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_379.wav	2.26	The pair are very much in love.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_380.wav	2.31	We will win the argument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_381.wav	1.97	Had this been common practice ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_382.wav	2.65	What do they want us to do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_383.wav	1.62	Is it worth it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_384.wav	1.71	Does it matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_385.wav	2.39	You have to rely on each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_386.wav	3.20	The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_387.wav	2.26	I wanted to go out on a high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_388.wav	3.58	Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_389.wav	2.82	That time may never be broken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_390.wav	2.09	It was fit for royalty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_391.wav	2.60	The response from them was good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_392.wav	2.82	There was a substantial explosion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_393.wav	2.05	But we are very near.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_394.wav	2.22	That's as good as it gets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_395.wav	2.27	A review is under way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_396.wav	3.03	He put some colour into Scottish history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_397.wav	3.03	This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_398.wav	2.22	They have failed to deliver.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_399.wav	2.18	Clark is back on top form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_400.wav	1.88	I had a fortunate war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_401.wav	2.52	She is in their hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_402.wav	1.96	It is a large number.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_403.wav	2.78	It does not even have a staff shortage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_404.wav	2.31	It is hard to understand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_405.wav	2.43	It was a bank holiday, after all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_406.wav	3.03	Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_407.wav	2.61	There was an element of frustration.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_408.wav	2.69	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_409.wav	2.86	How do you take them away ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_411.wav	1.96	After the match, do you ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_412.wav	2.61	I will always remember the horrible images.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_414.wav	1.97	They are looking for profit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_415.wav	2.27	I remain a buyer of the shares.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_416.wav	2.18	There is some light in the tunnel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_417.wav	2.69	He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_418.wav	3.12	There will be widespread support on all sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_419.wav	2.18	The case will now go to appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_420.wav	3.50	Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_421.wav	2.57	There is a solution, she believes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_422.wav	2.35	Yet the data is compelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_423.wav	3.03	It was important to win the singles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_424.wav	3.12	The road was closed for several hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_426.wav	2.61	My aim is a top six finish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_427.wav	3.20	I would love to think that she could win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_428.wav	2.78	Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_429.wav	2.01	He is on the wrong side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_430.wav	2.73	It was a breathtaking moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_431.wav	2.82	I was in jail for five years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_432.wav	2.39	I never had a childhood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_433.wav	2.73	It is based on a true story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_434.wav	2.01	But it can be done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_435.wav	3.20	I never won a penny throughout my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_436.wav	2.86	There will be no excuses on Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_437.wav	2.39	The growth potential is enormous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_438.wav	2.01	They are not left wing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_439.wav	2.82	The British government does not want to know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_440.wav	2.18	They said they were only young men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_441.wav	2.39	We shall not forget him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_442.wav	1.79	The people are the hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_443.wav	2.39	They made a huge impression on me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_444.wav	3.03	It's never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_445.wav	2.22	It sounded like a bomb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_446.wav	2.77	Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_447.wav	2.69	We've got a good management record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_448.wav	3.41	Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_449.wav	2.18	And we might go back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_450.wav	2.82	We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_451.wav	2.43	We went straight into the bedroom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_452.wav	2.82	Its future is no longer in question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_453.wav	2.22	We put our bid in last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_454.wav	3.37	Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_456.wav	1.75	They have to be met.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_457.wav	2.56	We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_458.wav	2.56	She has reached the top of her profession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_459.wav	2.26	But he has a lifeline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_460.wav	2.94	A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_461.wav	2.91	They were good years for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_462.wav	2.52	Let that be their memorial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_463.wav	3.12	Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_464.wav	2.05	Driving has been the key.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_465.wav	2.95	She has now been registered as disabled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_466.wav	2.61	He is well respected by his colleagues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_467.wav	2.95	Classes must be reduced by half.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_468.wav	2.14	War is not the action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_469.wav	4.14	However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_470.wav	2.60	It is too early to speculate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_471.wav	2.26	Dennis was not so sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_472.wav	2.35	He felt it was the right time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_473.wav	2.48	It was clear on Thursday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_474.wav	2.99	The casting of her husband was an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_475.wav	2.95	It was all in a short period of time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p231\p231_476.wav	3.16	That was the first time I worked with Richard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_001.wav	2.56	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_002.wav	3.25	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_003.wav	8.06	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_004.wav	4.44	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_005.wav	7.26	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_006.wav	6.06	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_007.wav	4.83	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_008.wav	7.08	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_009.wav	5.04	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_010.wav	3.03	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_011.wav	6.83	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_012.wav	5.21	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_013.wav	4.65	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_014.wav	5.17	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_015.wav	6.32	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_016.wav	6.15	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_017.wav	3.29	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_018.wav	5.08	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_019.wav	7.73	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_020.wav	4.19	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_021.wav	9.22	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_022.wav	6.44	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_023.wav	10.03	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_024.wav	6.66	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_025.wav	2.65	Johnson was pretty low.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_026.wav	1.45	But it failed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_027.wav	4.31	Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_028.wav	2.43	They should be so lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_029.wav	3.72	Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_030.wav	4.44	They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_031.wav	2.56	It's a matter of balance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_032.wav	3.67	They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_033.wav	1.67	I would love it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_034.wav	1.62	It is marvellous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_035.wav	3.59	Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_036.wav	3.24	But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_037.wav	4.57	Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_038.wav	2.35	It was fit for royalty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_039.wav	2.09	I was scared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_040.wav	2.18	Dancing was her life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_041.wav	2.18	I suspect the latter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_042.wav	2.90	You must always attempt to raise the bar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_043.wav	2.22	But it took a lot of bottle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_044.wav	1.41	We will push.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_045.wav	1.37	It is urgent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_046.wav	1.63	The judge said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_047.wav	2.44	It is difficult for Ali.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_048.wav	2.48	But it might have done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_049.wav	3.80	The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_050.wav	1.96	They had to explain it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_051.wav	1.80	Here's a clue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_052.wav	2.48	We were surprised to see the photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_053.wav	2.09	It's the big omission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_054.wav	4.36	Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_055.wav	1.80	It's very odd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_056.wav	2.39	Because we do not need it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_057.wav	2.74	It's not pretty, but it's effective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_058.wav	4.40	This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_059.wav	1.58	That's the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_060.wav	3.12	That is very hard, alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_061.wav	4.06	The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_062.wav	3.54	The problems are a result of that shortfall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_063.wav	2.56	You do not change overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_064.wav	2.56	People love to see this stuff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_065.wav	1.92	He was popular.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_066.wav	3.76	I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_067.wav	3.08	Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_068.wav	3.16	It is like a river running by my home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_069.wav	3.12	We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_070.wav	3.20	There is an element of racism in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_071.wav	3.12	Painful, but only because it's true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_072.wav	2.65	That was the easy election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_073.wav	2.31	There could be a way back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_074.wav	2.65	Then followed a bout of flu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_075.wav	2.61	The price cuts are really exciting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_076.wav	2.01	I had my suspicions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_077.wav	1.92	It was chaotic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_078.wav	2.99	It is a job creation scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_079.wav	2.94	He is now resident in England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_080.wav	2.35	I've got the shirt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_081.wav	2.10	Today she has been released.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_082.wav	1.88	What has changed ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_083.wav	2.05	That is bound to happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_084.wav	1.54	I will miss him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_085.wav	2.65	It's all going to clear the debt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_086.wav	2.52	She had kept the news from him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_087.wav	2.14	No progress has been made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_088.wav	3.07	Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_089.wav	2.90	Now the system is right behind us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_090.wav	4.52	Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_091.wav	2.22	It is a lifeline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_092.wav	2.65	Today I couldn't run on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_093.wav	2.69	However, it did not end that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_094.wav	3.72	This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_095.wav	4.01	I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_096.wav	2.14	Then came the crunch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_097.wav	2.90	The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_098.wav	3.24	I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_099.wav	3.24	They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_100.wav	1.71	It was mayhem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_101.wav	2.14	They were outside the circle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_102.wav	2.09	It was a good performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_103.wav	3.93	We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_104.wav	4.65	There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_105.wav	2.31	That is no use.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_106.wav	3.25	It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_107.wav	3.16	While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_108.wav	1.88	He pleaded for caution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_109.wav	4.14	He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_110.wav	2.30	I don't have many friends.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_111.wav	1.84	He was jailed for a year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_112.wav	1.96	You had better believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_113.wav	1.50	It's not fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_114.wav	3.93	We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_115.wav	3.58	Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_116.wav	2.26	Maybe this battle has been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_117.wav	3.67	Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_118.wav	3.67	Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_119.wav	4.27	This is the end of a chapter, and this is very sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_120.wav	1.75	It is rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_121.wav	3.71	That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_122.wav	3.50	The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_123.wav	4.23	An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_124.wav	1.88	That's all right then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_125.wav	1.84	I'm so angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_126.wav	2.26	Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_127.wav	2.39	It has removed a bit of guilt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_128.wav	3.16	Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_129.wav	3.97	The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_130.wav	3.58	Offered the gold medal, he declined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_131.wav	3.54	That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_132.wav	2.05	I am now unemployed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_133.wav	2.86	If not, a deal could take many months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_134.wav	2.13	You've got to be vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_135.wav	2.13	Our intentions are real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_136.wav	1.84	They took a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_137.wav	2.01	The goals were good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_138.wav	1.75	What will happen then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_139.wav	2.44	I am totally devoted to this job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_140.wav	1.80	He is severe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_141.wav	1.84	She died at her home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_142.wav	3.07	I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_143.wav	2.13	They did very well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_144.wav	2.69	The home side didn't stand a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_145.wav	3.12	We want to see the maximum of change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_146.wav	2.52	It was deployed in the Gulf War.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_147.wav	3.21	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_148.wav	3.97	The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_149.wav	2.73	We also enjoyed a lot of support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_150.wav	2.14	She had gone to the Catholic school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_151.wav	3.25	It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_152.wav	2.10	It was by the numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_153.wav	2.39	I was in daily contact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_154.wav	2.69	They were later discharged from hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_155.wav	3.03	This latter point is hugely important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_156.wav	2.44	It is an attitude of mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_158.wav	3.37	They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_159.wav	2.14	We have to move forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_160.wav	4.18	Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_161.wav	3.37	We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_162.wav	2.61	Tell it like it was ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_163.wav	2.60	It is not too late to get on board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_164.wav	2.86	That must be left to the Parole Board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_165.wav	1.88	Again, we were lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_166.wav	3.08	Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_167.wav	3.20	Waiting times for these services are too long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_168.wav	1.75	That will do for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_169.wav	3.93	It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_170.wav	2.56	We've made a couple of albums.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_171.wav	2.26	My life has been destroyed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_172.wav	2.82	They thought they had found a home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_173.wav	2.48	It became a book by itself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_174.wav	2.39	I always felt they played for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_175.wav	3.25	You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_176.wav	3.29	First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_177.wav	2.65	Blair's response was weak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_178.wav	2.10	It's the real thing, for sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_179.wav	4.10	However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_180.wav	3.80	The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_181.wav	2.94	The clarity is vital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_182.wav	3.80	I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_183.wav	2.60	Everyone can be bought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_184.wav	2.30	A career as a doctor is on hold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_185.wav	3.42	Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_186.wav	2.60	It is the whole package.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_187.wav	1.66	I've been there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_188.wav	4.44	Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_189.wav	2.69	They receive a high profile in the media.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_190.wav	2.52	We did everything by the book.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_191.wav	2.61	I wish I could say something.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_192.wav	3.76	Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_193.wav	2.99	The procedure is the same in all cases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_194.wav	4.10	But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_195.wav	2.82	I wanted to put myself on the line.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_196.wav	2.35	I came home by ambulance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_197.wav	4.31	The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_198.wav	2.69	The conference is the first test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_199.wav	3.46	The service from the other players was super.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_200.wav	4.10	He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_201.wav	2.99	On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_202.wav	3.42	The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_203.wav	2.22	A deadline is still essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_204.wav	3.89	We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_205.wav	2.05	It's a mixture of everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_206.wav	3.12	We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_207.wav	1.93	I don't want to use it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_208.wav	1.84	Now, it's all right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_209.wav	1.80	There was an e-mail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_210.wav	1.84	That's the day job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_211.wav	1.67	Feel the heat ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_212.wav	1.33	He knows a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_213.wav	2.73	He is slightly confused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_214.wav	2.73	She should not be blamed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_215.wav	2.69	His third goal was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_216.wav	3.97	He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_217.wav	2.01	It's not ideal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_218.wav	2.69	He seemed to lose his focus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_219.wav	4.44	He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_220.wav	4.01	The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_221.wav	3.89	Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_223.wav	3.07	It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_224.wav	2.48	That has been the easy part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_225.wav	2.09	We've got the bronze.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_226.wav	2.60	Mental health is a massive issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_227.wav	3.55	At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_228.wav	2.05	It was good fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_229.wav	2.47	What was the main difference ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_230.wav	2.05	I am immensely sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_231.wav	3.03	I'd never seen a play about me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_232.wav	5.29	It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_233.wav	2.65	The track is currently covered in snow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_234.wav	1.80	But she was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_235.wav	4.27	Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_236.wav	1.88	We were awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_237.wav	3.16	However, no further action was taken by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_238.wav	3.16	And thought we would get away with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_239.wav	2.35	It is set in Paris.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_240.wav	3.71	The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_241.wav	1.75	It's quite nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_242.wav	2.22	It's quite a line-up!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_243.wav	2.52	It's a lovely, lovely film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_244.wav	3.63	The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_245.wav	2.78	Broke the birdie record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_246.wav	2.99	He claimed the government had lost the plot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_247.wav	2.18	She is well balanced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_248.wav	3.93	A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_249.wav	3.38	Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_250.wav	3.59	He says that he is no different from any other man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_251.wav	3.89	Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_252.wav	3.63	We did not compete with any other local farmer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_253.wav	3.76	I was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_254.wav	3.12	Some families have even requested to leave the city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_255.wav	3.16	It's a record label, not a form of music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_256.wav	2.30	A friendship that will endure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_257.wav	2.05	I can't get a job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_258.wav	3.12	He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_259.wav	4.53	For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_260.wav	3.42	The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_261.wav	3.63	One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_262.wav	3.50	It does not appear at this stage that alcohol was a factor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_263.wav	3.29	However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_264.wav	3.54	The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_265.wav	2.22	Blood samples were taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_266.wav	2.91	They want to shut the Scottish Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_267.wav	3.89	That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_268.wav	2.61	Of course, that is not the whole story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_269.wav	3.42	The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_270.wav	3.54	Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_271.wav	3.41	Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_272.wav	2.78	He is a young man with a new deal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_273.wav	3.24	He was also married with two children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_274.wav	3.16	Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_275.wav	3.37	Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_276.wav	2.94	Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_277.wav	3.72	She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_278.wav	2.82	They wanted the club to make money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_279.wav	2.95	Finally, he paid for the movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_280.wav	3.46	Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_281.wav	2.13	It's a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_282.wav	3.97	The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_283.wav	2.22	I am an estate agent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_284.wav	3.42	The record companies have gone through the floor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_285.wav	2.69	They were on holiday in Egypt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_286.wav	2.56	It was a privilege to work for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_287.wav	2.61	It happens from time to time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_288.wav	1.97	He looked very sharp.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_289.wav	3.67	Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_290.wav	2.86	I saw it at a ruck.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_291.wav	2.95	They were also beside themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_292.wav	3.03	The attacker died in the crash.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_293.wav	3.71	The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_294.wav	3.72	A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_295.wav	3.42	Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_296.wav	2.35	He was obviously very genuine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_297.wav	2.43	These figures are truly awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_298.wav	2.01	He should have won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_299.wav	1.79	He has retired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_300.wav	2.86	What has altered ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_301.wav	3.20	I thought it was my only chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_302.wav	1.84	Nothing is safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_303.wav	4.25	He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_305.wav	1.79	They are wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_306.wav	2.27	It is a road of death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_307.wav	4.35	The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_308.wav	2.39	We are in the end game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_309.wav	2.95	We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_310.wav	1.75	He was solid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_311.wav	2.26	Special measures were needed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_312.wav	3.20	There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_313.wav	2.61	I never thought it would take this long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_314.wav	2.01	We are a peaceful people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_315.wav	1.84	Kids are terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_316.wav	1.92	It should be equal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_317.wav	2.90	Craig is a major concern for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_318.wav	2.86	The home team had an amazing start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_319.wav	3.20	For the moment, our position remains the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_320.wav	2.82	Referees are easy targets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_321.wav	3.12	Davis is very supportive, as a director.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_322.wav	2.99	However, the groups denied the claims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_323.wav	2.86	I came into this world with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_324.wav	4.27	We think all other measures are not exhausted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_325.wav	2.14	Off with their heads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_326.wav	2.01	It's not long enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_327.wav	3.07	My view has now completely changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_328.wav	3.85	They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_329.wav	3.29	We agreed to disagree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_330.wav	2.39	It could have gone either way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_331.wav	3.50	He was then replaced by Ross.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_332.wav	2.90	Horses are drawn by ballot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_333.wav	3.08	I'd like to take the plunge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_334.wav	3.50	Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_335.wav	2.90	She did not attend the courtroom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_336.wav	3.07	It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_337.wav	3.37	His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_338.wav	2.69	The team for the first game could be this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_339.wav	2.48	They haven't got a hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_340.wav	1.92	Who will do it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_341.wav	3.63	Gaelic provision continued to be good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_342.wav	3.54	That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_343.wav	4.91	He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_344.wav	2.22	He has to learn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_345.wav	1.92	Indeed, it was magical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_346.wav	2.43	Tiger is the exception.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_347.wav	3.67	Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_348.wav	4.06	That is the very reason why it was so vital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_349.wav	3.46	I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_350.wav	3.50	Chambers said he would accept the place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_351.wav	2.01	Everything was an effort.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_352.wav	2.22	The boat was fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_353.wav	3.50	Like his acting, it was an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_354.wav	1.93	It is long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_355.wav	4.06	On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_356.wav	3.84	That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_357.wav	2.61	He had played well in that central role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_358.wav	2.65	It's not that clear-cut.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_359.wav	1.88	She is free.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_360.wav	3.37	It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_361.wav	2.27	I kept going for her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_362.wav	4.36	You must have a government and a good civil service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_363.wav	4.83	But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_364.wav	3.97	It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_365.wav	2.73	However, it was well worth the wait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_366.wav	2.18	It benefits the whole family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_367.wav	2.14	He has seen the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_368.wav	2.52	It was one in the afternoon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_369.wav	4.23	To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_370.wav	1.92	We will be homeless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_371.wav	2.86	The scene is about this ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_372.wav	3.97	Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_373.wav	3.67	Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_374.wav	3.93	The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_375.wav	3.50	It was a double tragedy for the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_376.wav	1.96	He could make it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_377.wav	3.93	For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_378.wav	4.91	The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_379.wav	3.50	They have not done so this season so far.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_380.wav	3.16	I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_381.wav	2.61	Well, the big day has arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_382.wav	2.31	Five members were disciplined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_383.wav	1.96	Talks are progressing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_384.wav	2.05	There is no signature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_385.wav	3.46	I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_386.wav	2.60	That left a bad taste in my mouth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_387.wav	3.88	It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_388.wav	3.03	Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_389.wav	2.56	It has moved on in the last week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_390.wav	2.39	That's the name of the game, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_391.wav	2.35	You thought it was a headache.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_392.wav	3.84	Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_393.wav	3.55	A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_394.wav	3.93	The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_395.wav	1.97	We're looking for justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_396.wav	2.14	I can lead by example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_397.wav	3.97	I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_398.wav	3.55	But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_399.wav	2.73	Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_400.wav	3.20	It will probably take me just days to spend it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_401.wav	2.05	It is legally binding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_402.wav	2.01	We knew nothing about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_403.wav	2.56	My house was shaking at the time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_404.wav	3.03	This is a huge confidence boost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_405.wav	3.80	We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_406.wav	2.09	He was a crazy man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_407.wav	1.84	We should have known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_408.wav	2.27	Feel the air, the space.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_409.wav	5.04	Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_410.wav	3.58	I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_411.wav	2.43	You wanted the evidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_412.wav	3.63	Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_413.wav	2.86	It was that bad, that low.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_414.wav	2.01	I was very young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p232\p232_415.wav	3.24	We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_001.wav	3.80	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_002.wav	5.04	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_003.wav	9.47	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_004.wav	6.49	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_005.wav	7.64	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_006.wav	6.79	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_007.wav	5.85	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_008.wav	8.92	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_009.wav	6.49	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_011.wav	7.64	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_012.wav	4.82	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_013.wav	4.95	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_014.wav	5.04	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_015.wav	5.93	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_016.wav	7.51	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_017.wav	5.16	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_018.wav	5.81	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_019.wav	7.85	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_020.wav	4.91	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_021.wav	9.31	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_022.wav	6.66	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_023.wav	10.88	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_024.wav	7.47	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_025.wav	3.16	We are a service industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_026.wav	2.27	But we will have to wait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_027.wav	4.87	Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_028.wav	4.23	I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_029.wav	3.80	However, the following year the cancer returned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_030.wav	4.48	On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_032.wav	4.14	Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_033.wav	2.86	This is a central issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_037.wav	3.71	However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_038.wav	2.95	Victory was never in doubt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_039.wav	4.78	Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_040.wav	4.74	We are the party of the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_041.wav	2.53	I have never been a member of the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_042.wav	2.35	He was in his element.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_043.wav	3.03	That means an extra two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_044.wav	5.21	At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_045.wav	3.97	All businesses continue to trade.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_046.wav	2.86	The man became a reporter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_047.wav	4.70	It depends on the decisions of the member states.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_048.wav	3.93	It is all starting to come together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_049.wav	3.76	Part of the complex is historic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_050.wav	3.21	The strategy is not without risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_051.wav	4.44	But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_052.wav	3.29	I was released after six days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_053.wav	3.84	Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_054.wav	2.27	We are working on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_055.wav	4.40	I've never been one for complaining about the press.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_056.wav	3.42	This trend is likely to strengthen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_057.wav	4.05	Still, he did not let himself down this week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_058.wav	3.93	For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_059.wav	2.61	There was no safety net.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_060.wav	3.76	He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_061.wav	2.78	You have to be patient.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_062.wav	2.82	That is all in the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_063.wav	2.82	That could be a mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_064.wav	2.91	It was an amazing result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_065.wav	2.91	Indeed, it is only the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_066.wav	2.39	He has not been dropped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_067.wav	4.70	Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_068.wav	5.38	Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_070.wav	4.27	This time, it might be for real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_071.wav	3.41	She did that for the rest of her life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_072.wav	4.40	Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_073.wav	2.99	It starts with the script.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_074.wav	3.03	We were under a bit of pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_075.wav	5.76	The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_076.wav	2.78	We can all make a mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_077.wav	4.31	Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_079.wav	4.36	However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_080.wav	3.20	On the night, it was not enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_081.wav	4.06	It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_082.wav	4.44	However, a ruling will not come before next week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_083.wav	3.03	They were badly prepared for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_084.wav	2.86	It is not a story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_085.wav	2.69	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_086.wav	2.69	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_087.wav	3.80	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_088.wav	3.46	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_089.wav	2.78	What do we do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_090.wav	3.03	Why do it otherwise ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_091.wav	4.40	However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_092.wav	3.37	They have a further report to make in March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_093.wav	4.22	He is in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_094.wav	3.80	The Festival is prepared to help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_095.wav	4.95	By then, he was walking on water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_096.wav	4.31	I had a bit in hand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_097.wav	4.01	We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_098.wav	3.67	I cannot wait to get started on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_099.wav	2.78	That is the fact of the matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_100.wav	4.78	It should be a condition of employment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_101.wav	3.50	I had no intention of misleading anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_102.wav	3.84	It is much as it has been described.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_103.wav	4.10	Police said the family was helping with the search.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_104.wav	4.01	She was there for the start of the campaign.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_105.wav	3.16	He has become a monster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_106.wav	3.89	In fact, he should never have been in the field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_107.wav	2.65	Everyone had to play the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_108.wav	3.97	In London today, it was business as usual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_109.wav	3.20	It is not affected by the sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_110.wav	3.50	We are currently working on the details.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_111.wav	4.18	According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_112.wav	2.95	I thought it was a fantastic game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_113.wav	3.50	The picture is the same across Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_114.wav	2.31	It was the eighties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_115.wav	3.59	We do not expect any surplus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_116.wav	2.69	You had better believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_117.wav	3.54	Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_118.wav	3.20	It's not a new concept in jazz.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_119.wav	2.48	My office is bare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_120.wav	2.43	I'm delighted about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_121.wav	1.92	I joined a group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_122.wav	4.87	They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_123.wav	3.03	Who would be a referee?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_125.wav	2.18	That's all right then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_126.wav	2.69	There were no grounds for his action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_127.wav	4.70	It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_128.wav	4.52	It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_129.wav	3.97	His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_130.wav	4.06	Next season for every manager is a long time away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_131.wav	3.97	It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_132.wav	3.50	He's been the key to everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_133.wav	2.82	It's an amazing landscape!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_134.wav	3.33	Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_135.wav	3.80	Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_136.wav	4.10	The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_137.wav	2.43	I am now unemployed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_138.wav	4.95	Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_139.wav	3.54	Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_140.wav	4.48	Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_141.wav	3.20	Mr Hall is believed to have broken a leg.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_142.wav	4.66	It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_143.wav	1.67	Is that it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_144.wav	2.87	I saw some terrible things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_146.wav	3.37	It seems so long since I did the exams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_147.wav	4.23	We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_148.wav	2.18	Who would be right ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_149.wav	2.44	She died at her home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_150.wav	4.99	He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_151.wav	4.14	That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_152.wav	2.52	It is like a football team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_153.wav	2.73	It would be a last resort.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_154.wav	4.61	Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_155.wav	3.29	He will emerge as a world leader.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_156.wav	3.42	It opens the door to the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_157.wav	3.33	The home side didn't stand a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_158.wav	4.36	The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_159.wav	3.89	But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_160.wav	2.99	I was so nervous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_161.wav	4.27	Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_162.wav	2.86	It was deployed in the Gulf War.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_163.wav	2.65	It is not normal practice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_164.wav	2.99	We also enjoyed a lot of support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_165.wav	3.46	The attacker has been put in foster care.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_166.wav	4.18	She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_167.wav	3.25	Neither side can win this war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_168.wav	3.63	Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_169.wav	2.18	It is so unfair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_170.wav	2.27	I will tell you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_171.wav	4.44	Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_172.wav	3.76	They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_173.wav	2.65	I have got a wife to feed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_174.wav	2.44	It's that sort of night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_175.wav	3.89	Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_176.wav	4.48	Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_177.wav	2.99	The release attracted little attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_178.wav	3.33	Waiting times for these services are too long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_179.wav	3.37	And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_180.wav	2.56	We've made a couple of albums.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_181.wav	2.78	They thought they had found a home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_182.wav	2.69	He will feel the pain again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_183.wav	2.78	I always felt they played for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_184.wav	2.31	Is Saddam a threat ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_185.wav	3.12	I feel like my game has come a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_186.wav	4.14	The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_187.wav	2.91	If that's the case, he will struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_188.wav	3.63	There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_189.wav	3.33	We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_190.wav	2.26	I was totally wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_191.wav	3.12	There is no point in looking any further.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_192.wav	1.93	I've been there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_193.wav	3.76	It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_194.wav	3.67	It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_195.wav	2.09	It's a joke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_196.wav	2.43	I had a train to catch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_197.wav	3.67	It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_198.wav	3.97	We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_199.wav	3.16	However, this idea is never developed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_200.wav	2.82	It's very difficult to find a buyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_201.wav	1.96	He may need it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_203.wav	4.52	It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_204.wav	1.96	It wasn't to be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_208.wav	3.84	It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_209.wav	2.05	I have a cold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_210.wav	2.73	He had suffered a heart attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_211.wav	3.80	A deadline is still essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_212.wav	3.89	I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_213.wav	2.27	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_214.wav	2.01	That will be vital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_215.wav	2.01	We need to handle it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_216.wav	4.01	The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_217.wav	2.01	I had relied on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_218.wav	2.74	His third goal was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_220.wav	2.94	In each case they were a goal down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_221.wav	3.08	The FBI could become involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_222.wav	2.05	Work has started.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_223.wav	4.40	The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_224.wav	3.50	He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_225.wav	3.42	The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_226.wav	4.06	Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_228.wav	3.33	Mental health is a massive issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_229.wav	2.78	You have to do your research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_230.wav	2.65	We played them off the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_231.wav	4.40	The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_232.wav	4.53	Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_233.wav	4.01	It's a question of creating a future awareness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_234.wav	3.12	My neighbours are horrified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_235.wav	3.71	But he failed to win the committee's support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_236.wav	2.99	I can't wait to meet him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_237.wav	3.29	Broke the birdie record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_238.wav	5.16	Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_239.wav	3.88	The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_240.wav	4.10	The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_241.wav	4.52	A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_242.wav	2.90	We were extremely poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_243.wav	4.65	I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_244.wav	4.23	Chambers said he would accept the place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_245.wav	4.14	I know I'm in a very special position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_246.wav	4.10	We did not compete with any other local farmer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_247.wav	3.80	The salary changes are long overdue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_248.wav	4.95	The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_249.wav	4.14	It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_250.wav	2.18	There wasn't a goal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_251.wav	2.73	It was a cry for help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_252.wav	2.99	A friendship that will endure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_253.wav	3.16	This year I understood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_254.wav	3.33	Her presence was almost everywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_255.wav	4.95	For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_256.wav	4.14	The distinction is also supported by doctors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_257.wav	2.90	I watched a game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_258.wav	3.93	There will be tough opponents to this report.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_259.wav	5.17	One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_260.wav	2.86	I was happily surprised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_261.wav	5.12	He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_262.wav	2.90	It is also very valuable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_263.wav	3.16	I've spent a lot of time on buses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_264.wav	3.84	This court has made an order which has not been observed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_265.wav	2.91	It is not just about pay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_266.wav	4.27	Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_267.wav	5.47	George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_268.wav	2.69	Blood samples were taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_269.wav	2.82	They are never here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_270.wav	4.40	That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_271.wav	3.37	It looks as though he will be right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_272.wav	3.33	We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_273.wav	3.03	Immediate action must be taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_274.wav	2.99	He is a young man with a new deal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_275.wav	3.12	It was an easy decision to come here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_276.wav	2.48	It is the same in Sweden.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_277.wav	2.52	And Michael was just great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_278.wav	3.93	It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_279.wav	3.71	Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_280.wav	3.89	She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_281.wav	5.16	Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_282.wav	4.19	However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_283.wav	2.09	I feel pretty good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_284.wav	2.61	They were on holiday in Egypt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_285.wav	2.86	It was a privilege to work for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_286.wav	4.10	It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_288.wav	2.26	They were too hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_289.wav	2.31	He looked very sharp.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_290.wav	2.31	All options are open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_291.wav	2.86	The attacker died in the crash.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_292.wav	2.13	It was a virus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_294.wav	4.35	I do not think this family will ever get over this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_295.wav	3.33	Like his acting, it was an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_296.wav	3.41	Sunday's game was not a trial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_297.wav	2.22	Who can predict ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_298.wav	3.33	This is a huge confidence boost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_299.wav	4.87	I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_300.wav	3.16	We have to sort it out ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_301.wav	6.27	That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_302.wav	3.20	I thought it was my only chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_303.wav	3.03	One was a lawyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_304.wav	4.31	Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_305.wav	2.82	They should be swept away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_306.wav	3.67	This is a war over our home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_307.wav	4.74	Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_308.wav	2.99	I was in daily contact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_309.wav	3.07	We want to play at the worlds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_310.wav	3.50	This is the culture change in medicine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_311.wav	2.91	Is there on his hands ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_312.wav	3.54	We have got no money to go anywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_313.wav	3.24	The election is total confusion and chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_314.wav	4.99	It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_315.wav	3.12	The problems began a long time ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_316.wav	2.95	My body is clearly capable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_317.wav	3.29	We are very strongly behind the bid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_319.wav	5.00	But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_320.wav	3.03	My view has now completely changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_321.wav	4.27	It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_322.wav	2.86	We agreed to disagree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_323.wav	5.55	On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_324.wav	2.39	I saw some good things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_325.wav	4.74	Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_326.wav	2.90	Robert is a special talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_327.wav	2.73	It added to the spectacle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_328.wav	2.86	Who was the mystery MP ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_329.wav	3.12	He told the court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_330.wav	4.01	The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_331.wav	1.92	Who will do it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_332.wav	3.63	However, Sharon rejected the claims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_333.wav	2.50	Gaelic provision continued to be good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_334.wav	4.23	He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_335.wav	4.66	Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_336.wav	4.48	The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_337.wav	4.40	Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_338.wav	2.65	Nobody else was with me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_339.wav	2.56	I've learned from my mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_340.wav	3.07	I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_341.wav	2.95	The composer will conduct.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_342.wav	3.46	I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_343.wav	5.00	This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_344.wav	3.42	His contract was then not renewed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_345.wav	3.16	Eight months later, he was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_346.wav	4.23	On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_347.wav	3.59	He had played well in that central role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_348.wav	3.29	The decision is an absolute disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_349.wav	2.99	Tyson is overwhelmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_350.wav	3.55	However, it was well worth the wait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_351.wav	3.03	He agreed with my proposal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_352.wav	2.09	Hartley should know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_353.wav	4.14	Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_354.wav	3.80	The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_355.wav	4.06	It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_356.wav	3.54	Also, it is the season of goodwill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_357.wav	2.60	Equity declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_358.wav	4.06	You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_359.wav	2.10	He could make it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_360.wav	3.54	The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_361.wav	3.59	They have not done so this season so far.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_362.wav	3.16	This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_363.wav	2.35	Safety was also an issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_364.wav	3.25	They received a reply from their own managers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_365.wav	1.84	But I managed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_366.wav	2.44	They play together perfectly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_367.wav	3.63	In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_368.wav	2.99	Colour was at the core of his life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_369.wav	3.93	It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_370.wav	3.55	Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_371.wav	2.65	We shall not be moved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_373.wav	2.56	It was a hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_374.wav	2.35	He's a nice guy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_375.wav	3.38	Treatment is not an issue with these people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_376.wav	3.93	Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_377.wav	4.95	Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_378.wav	2.95	The mood was defiant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_379.wav	2.31	Yet the data is compelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_381.wav	2.39	It's just outrageous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_382.wav	2.95	The road was closed for several hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_383.wav	1.97	It is unusual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_384.wav	3.33	That will come after the game on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_385.wav	4.06	The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_386.wav	2.18	That set the tone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_387.wav	2.48	It was a breathtaking moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_388.wav	2.86	I was in jail for five years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_389.wav	2.26	What happened in the summer ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_390.wav	4.10	The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_391.wav	4.53	Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p233\p233_392.wav	5.46	He has not created a Festival resource.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_001.wav	3.25	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_002.wav	3.97	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_003.wav	6.87	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_004.wav	4.87	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_005.wav	7.25	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_006.wav	5.97	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_007.wav	5.42	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_008.wav	7.38	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_009.wav	5.34	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_010.wav	3.50	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_012.wav	4.61	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_013.wav	4.44	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_014.wav	4.61	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_015.wav	5.89	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_016.wav	6.66	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_017.wav	4.02	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_018.wav	6.36	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_019.wav	7.64	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_020.wav	5.25	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_021.wav	9.60	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_022.wav	6.70	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_023.wav	9.56	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_024.wav	6.96	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_025.wav	3.07	We are a service industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_026.wav	2.31	But we will have to wait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_027.wav	3.67	Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_028.wav	3.84	I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_029.wav	3.63	However, the following year the cancer returned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_030.wav	5.12	On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_031.wav	2.35	It is on the internet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_032.wav	3.50	Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_033.wav	2.56	This is a central issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_034.wav	4.74	It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_035.wav	3.08	History is in the making.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_036.wav	2.95	It was sold at a loss.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_037.wav	4.35	However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_038.wav	2.39	Victory was never in doubt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_039.wav	5.76	Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_040.wav	3.03	We are the party of the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_041.wav	2.86	I have never been a member of the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_042.wav	2.18	He was in his element.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_043.wav	2.52	That means an extra two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_044.wav	2.92	At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_045.wav	2.95	All businesses continue to trade.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_046.wav	2.73	The man became a reporter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_047.wav	3.37	It depends on the decisions of the member states.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_048.wav	3.20	It is all starting to come together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_049.wav	3.03	Part of the complex is historic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_050.wav	3.46	The strategy is not without risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_051.wav	4.14	But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_052.wav	3.59	I was released after six days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_053.wav	4.65	Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_054.wav	2.31	We are working on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_055.wav	4.69	I've never been one for complaining about the press.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_056.wav	3.38	This trend is likely to strengthen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_057.wav	4.18	Still, he did not let himself down this week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_058.wav	3.84	For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_059.wav	2.44	There was no safety net.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_060.wav	3.37	He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_061.wav	2.56	You have to be patient.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_062.wav	2.43	That is all in the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_063.wav	2.35	That could be a mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_064.wav	2.52	It was an amazing result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_065.wav	2.82	Indeed, it is only the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_066.wav	2.35	He has not been dropped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_067.wav	4.06	Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_068.wav	4.87	Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_069.wav	3.42	The market is appalling for initial public offerings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_070.wav	2.65	This time, it might be for real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_071.wav	2.74	She did that for the rest of her life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_072.wav	2.90	Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_073.wav	2.43	It starts with the script.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_074.wav	2.56	We were under a bit of pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_075.wav	4.48	The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_076.wav	2.39	We can all make a mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_077.wav	4.10	Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_079.wav	3.63	However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_080.wav	2.86	On the night, it was not enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_081.wav	4.36	It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_082.wav	3.54	However, a ruling will not come before next week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_083.wav	3.71	They were badly prepared for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_084.wav	2.82	It is not a story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_085.wav	2.99	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_086.wav	2.30	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_087.wav	2.56	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_088.wav	2.27	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_089.wav	2.09	What do we do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_090.wav	2.18	Why do it otherwise ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_091.wav	3.71	However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_092.wav	3.80	They have a further report to make in March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_093.wav	2.90	He is in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_094.wav	2.69	The Festival is prepared to help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_095.wav	2.91	By then, he was walking on water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_096.wav	2.31	I had a bit in hand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_097.wav	4.10	We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_098.wav	3.03	I cannot wait to get started on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_099.wav	3.20	That is the fact of the matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_100.wav	3.46	It should be a condition of employment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_101.wav	3.67	I had no intention of misleading anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_102.wav	2.93	It is much as it has been described.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_103.wav	3.80	Police said the family was helping with the search.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_104.wav	3.41	She was there for the start of the campaign.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_105.wav	2.69	He has become a monster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_106.wav	3.29	In fact, he should never have been in the field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_107.wav	2.86	Everyone had to play the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_108.wav	3.63	In London today, it was business as usual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_109.wav	2.52	It is not affected by the sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_110.wav	2.82	We are currently working on the details.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_111.wav	4.40	That would be decided at the interim results in November, he added.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_112.wav	3.20	That would be a serious problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_113.wav	3.71	Our action is not the end, but the beginning of a process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_114.wav	3.29	People have been placed in a state of alarm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_115.wav	2.86	She is not a victim.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_116.wav	3.76	A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_117.wav	2.99	And we had a good response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_118.wav	2.65	When we looked at the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_119.wav	2.86	No, the equipment is extra.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_120.wav	3.12	For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_121.wav	3.93	The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_122.wav	2.99	That admission is not surprising.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_123.wav	3.71	While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_124.wav	3.80	According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_125.wav	2.48	There was a lot of resentment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_126.wav	2.90	He wanted to record the group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_127.wav	3.33	However, it was a different story in the final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_128.wav	2.69	The end result is the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_129.wav	2.86	Three days later, he was killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_130.wav	2.61	We are committed to the ban.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_131.wav	3.84	However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_132.wav	5.64	The problem was a social problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_133.wav	2.95	He had no money left to run the club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_134.wav	2.65	It is not so simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_135.wav	3.07	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_136.wav	2.39	So, did she meet him ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_137.wav	2.61	So what is the campaign about ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_138.wav	1.97	And does it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_139.wav	2.39	Are you from the rugby ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_140.wav	3.12	Actors like to be in the centre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_141.wav	3.54	When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_142.wav	3.54	They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_143.wav	3.42	Here, again, they were denied a voice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_144.wav	3.29	Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_145.wav	2.95	I can't even get into the A team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_146.wav	3.12	In addition, investor choice is reduced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_147.wav	3.08	She does not want to speak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_148.wav	2.91	It is expected to last a week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_149.wav	3.76	Full consent is expected by the end of next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_150.wav	3.80	It is too pretty, it is too small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_151.wav	3.46	As for the warning, it was not needed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_152.wav	3.63	But it is different in different regions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_153.wav	4.06	That is the nature of the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_154.wav	2.88	There is a spring in the step.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_155.wav	1.99	We want to get there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_156.wav	3.42	He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_157.wav	3.16	I have a lot of confidence in this team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_158.wav	2.91	The players were under pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_159.wav	4.22	Not that the occasion was without restraint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_160.wav	2.95	There is no common ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_161.wav	4.78	In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_162.wav	2.86	In that case, the children were not missing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_163.wav	2.73	Frankly, it was worth the booking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_164.wav	3.93	Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_165.wav	2.22	Anyone can do the sums.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_166.wav	3.29	At the moment we do not understand it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_167.wav	3.50	So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_168.wav	3.12	It is not about the money, it is about everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_169.wav	4.48	Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_170.wav	3.67	Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_171.wav	2.78	Much of the equipment was new.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_172.wav	2.30	I have had a good life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_173.wav	2.90	Three hours later, the man was free.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_174.wav	2.99	That was the difference between the sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_175.wav	2.65	They have not been named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_176.wav	1.84	I was in a hole.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_177.wav	2.99	It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_178.wav	2.39	I was always in control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_179.wav	3.89	I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_180.wav	4.74	For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_181.wav	2.69	He was asked to quit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_182.wav	4.83	There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_183.wav	3.20	Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_184.wav	3.29	They were not seeking the right to strike.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_185.wav	3.59	He called for a public inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_186.wav	3.42	Tony Blair has had a good conference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_187.wav	2.61	As, indeed, they would be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_188.wav	4.31	By then, however, both men were already in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_189.wav	2.56	It is simply not true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_190.wav	3.71	In light of things, I think I made the right decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_191.wav	2.99	It is not in the public interest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_192.wav	3.12	Well, this article is a bit like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_193.wav	2.73	The performance is not there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_194.wav	3.55	It would make a lot of sense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_195.wav	3.63	At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_196.wav	2.95	Clearly, they had other problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_197.wav	2.65	He has defended the system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_198.wav	3.50	If that's the case, he will struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_199.wav	2.91	I could not sit in the stands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_200.wav	4.78	At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_201.wav	3.37	They have to get that sorted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_202.wav	4.36	Yet the performance was not entirely convincing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_203.wav	2.52	We can take the city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_204.wav	2.22	Are you going to win ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_205.wav	1.92	Was it the wife ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_207.wav	2.74	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_208.wav	2.13	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_209.wav	2.43	I will be in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_210.wav	3.42	It was the story of the second half.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_211.wav	2.82	The trading conditions are not good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_212.wav	3.80	It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_213.wav	4.06	Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_214.wav	2.39	This is an interesting link.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_216.wav	3.20	It was a management problem in the hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_217.wav	3.46	Being investor ready is a good start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_218.wav	3.41	Last night, the company could not be contacted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_219.wav	4.31	I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_220.wav	3.38	This conference was never confirmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_221.wav	3.59	However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_222.wav	4.10	We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_223.wav	2.95	He must have a crack at it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_224.wav	2.77	The force is with them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_225.wav	3.24	Her experience is certainly limited.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_226.wav	3.50	The deal is expected to be completed by September.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_227.wav	3.54	However, he said the money had not been wasted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_228.wav	2.39	Mr Blair was ready for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_229.wav	3.12	We are waiting for the Minister to come back with an answer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_230.wav	3.50	He intends to restart in the spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_231.wav	2.18	He is a good friend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_232.wav	2.65	It is the strength of the school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_233.wav	2.69	But it may not be all bad news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_234.wav	3.80	It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_235.wav	2.69	The conference is the first test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_236.wav	4.31	Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_237.wav	3.54	But we are not immune to the problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_238.wav	5.34	I was not overly concerned about this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_239.wav	4.44	However, it is not as simple as this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_240.wav	4.53	On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_241.wav	3.25	A deadline is still essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_242.wav	3.03	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_243.wav	3.20	Was everything done to save people ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_244.wav	3.80	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_245.wav	2.99	Do I think about them often ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_246.wav	3.37	Is it in the right place ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_247.wav	2.31	Did he trip ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_248.wav	3.93	I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_249.wav	4.01	You can buy them over the counter, anywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_250.wav	4.01	We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_251.wav	3.16	We have an election in eight days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_252.wav	3.11	It was far from business as usual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_253.wav	2.95	It was just another play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_254.wav	4.35	From there, they can go anywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_255.wav	2.74	The world is a good place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_256.wav	4.01	This is a sensible and common sense approach.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_257.wav	2.99	The matter is under appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_258.wav	3.12	I am delighted for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_259.wav	4.01	It was a great experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_260.wav	4.31	They are difficult awards to decide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_261.wav	4.40	Anyway, the job will be part-time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_262.wav	2.56	His second was a beauty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_263.wav	5.47	However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_264.wav	5.93	Scotland played a major part in the project.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_265.wav	5.42	Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_266.wav	3.41	Not in this production he doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_267.wav	3.67	We can certainly build on this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_268.wav	3.84	Then was the summer of their discontent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_269.wav	3.88	There is a world of difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_270.wav	5.16	This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_271.wav	3.12	Well, it was certainly different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_272.wav	3.37	We want this place to work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_273.wav	2.65	Clearly, the stakes are high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_274.wav	3.93	So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_275.wav	3.25	The statement contained no surprises.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_276.wav	3.20	The performance continues to improve.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_277.wav	2.52	That would be a danger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_278.wav	3.25	Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_279.wav	4.31	However, no further action was taken by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_280.wav	3.42	It depends on Labour, not on us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_281.wav	2.69	I had to be into it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_282.wav	3.46	My view has always been the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_283.wav	3.67	In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_284.wav	2.18	It is set in Paris.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_285.wav	2.69	Do you think we're a top nation ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_286.wav	2.95	Is our children learning ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_287.wav	2.43	How independent is that ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_288.wav	2.86	What form did that take ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_289.wav	2.39	Are they free ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_290.wav	3.24	The party has never fully recovered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_291.wav	3.11	In many ways, that is as important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_292.wav	2.78	His leader wanted to celebrate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_293.wav	3.54	It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_294.wav	3.08	Of further privacy, he had no need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_295.wav	2.69	He was good, but not that good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_296.wav	2.73	The results are expected within days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_297.wav	3.89	The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_298.wav	3.38	Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_299.wav	2.78	We were well worth the win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_300.wav	2.43	And it was this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_301.wav	2.73	But that's another story for another day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_302.wav	2.22	But it was also hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_303.wav	3.59	If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_304.wav	2.86	We're looking for unity in the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_305.wav	4.18	By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_306.wav	2.95	They are not going the length of the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_307.wav	4.23	However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_308.wav	2.78	The concerns are the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_309.wav	5.46	That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_310.wav	3.21	Scotland won by six wickets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_311.wav	2.44	It has to be enforced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_312.wav	1.75	And we can do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_313.wav	2.22	Every one is a winner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_314.wav	4.23	Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_315.wav	2.14	They have set the standard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_316.wav	3.16	This is a major property in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_317.wav	3.80	It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_318.wav	3.42	The existing structure is in trouble.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_319.wav	3.37	It all started with a visiting rugby club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_320.wav	3.46	He refused to reveal the reasons for the split.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_321.wav	3.16	You have to count on other people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_322.wav	3.71	Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_323.wav	2.39	And he's the real thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_324.wav	2.95	What are they for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_325.wav	2.22	Is there a waiting list ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_326.wav	3.08	Do they think anyone else wants them ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_327.wav	3.12	But it is important for a number of reasons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_328.wav	3.37	All of the management has invested in the firm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_329.wav	3.67	The family is not interested in the value of the house.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_330.wav	5.08	It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_331.wav	4.44	Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_332.wav	2.05	But it can be done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_333.wav	3.24	Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_334.wav	2.95	We have to be very, very careful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_335.wav	3.42	In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_336.wav	2.14	This could be a mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_337.wav	2.86	Hopefully, this week will be good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_338.wav	4.01	Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_339.wav	3.12	I think the overall picture is still strong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_340.wav	3.33	That is always a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_341.wav	3.12	We will deliver at director level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_342.wav	2.52	We did something about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_343.wav	2.48	The market is the market.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_344.wav	2.26	We do not have the papers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_345.wav	3.08	However, the devil is in the detail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_346.wav	3.33	For the moment, however, the position is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_347.wav	3.12	The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_348.wav	2.39	The answer was in space.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_349.wav	2.99	We are not interested in dividends.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_350.wav	4.10	Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_351.wav	2.90	His concern is only for the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_352.wav	2.39	And it's a goodbye from him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_353.wav	2.48	They have to be addressed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_354.wav	3.50	If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_355.wav	2.77	However, a bid was never made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_356.wav	2.77	That is the lesson of the last three weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_357.wav	2.56	The City welcomed the numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_358.wav	2.52	Something is going to have to give.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_359.wav	2.05	There's still a bit to go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_360.wav	3.88	They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p234\p234_361.wav	2.65	We never played at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_002.wav	3.46	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_003.wav	6.15	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_004.wav	4.87	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_005.wav	7.21	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_006.wav	5.68	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_007.wav	4.31	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_009.wav	4.61	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_010.wav	2.82	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_011.wav	6.83	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_012.wav	4.06	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_013.wav	4.06	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_014.wav	4.57	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_015.wav	5.25	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_016.wav	6.45	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_017.wav	3.50	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_018.wav	5.25	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_019.wav	6.44	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_020.wav	3.80	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_021.wav	8.24	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_023.wav	10.45	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_024.wav	6.36	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_025.wav	3.16	A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_026.wav	3.03	In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_027.wav	2.73	Meetings will also remain private.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_028.wav	1.88	Because we do not need it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_029.wav	2.52	It's going to have a hell of an effect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_030.wav	1.75	And we have a singer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_031.wav	2.69	He was jailed for four years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_032.wav	2.10	He should emerge as the winner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_033.wav	2.39	This is a central issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_034.wav	2.09	He works at the airport.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_035.wav	2.35	It is not for any other purpose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_036.wav	3.46	If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_037.wav	2.13	It carried a double message.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_038.wav	2.48	That means an extra two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_039.wav	2.60	That was the case with David.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_040.wav	3.93	The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_041.wav	2.90	I needed a change, a new challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_042.wav	2.65	Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_043.wav	2.39	Their campaign is in disarray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_044.wav	3.29	But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_045.wav	2.09	We are working on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_046.wav	1.97	He looks like an Afghan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_047.wav	2.31	Everything else is a bonus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_048.wav	2.74	Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_049.wav	2.78	This is the interesting part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_050.wav	2.18	I haven't been ill at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_051.wav	3.07	They just thought it was extremely good acting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_052.wav	2.22	That was the difference today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_053.wav	1.71	We keep an eye on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_054.wav	2.74	The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_055.wav	2.30	We felt it was sufficient.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_056.wav	3.29	You must have a government and a good civil service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_057.wav	3.97	Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_058.wav	2.77	You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_059.wav	3.59	But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_060.wav	1.96	I have proved that in the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_061.wav	2.52	The tournament has now been cancelled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_062.wav	2.43	I was very pleased with them today, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_063.wav	2.01	I was as strong as a horse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_064.wav	2.09	Then followed a bout of flu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_065.wav	4.36	The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_066.wav	2.77	Both men were on one-year contracts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_068.wav	3.76	Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_069.wav	2.82	It is a job creation scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_070.wav	2.09	He was seen as the enemy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_071.wav	1.96	It looks like a hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_072.wav	2.90	These people are not big names.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_073.wav	3.71	This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_074.wav	1.71	We did it for the jersey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_075.wav	2.65	The Festival is prepared to help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_076.wav	2.65	Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_077.wav	2.69	By then, he was walking on water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_078.wav	2.22	He was just a journalist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_079.wav	2.99	On Saturday, it was much the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_080.wav	2.18	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_081.wav	2.22	We have turned the corner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_083.wav	2.01	The Queen Mother is dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_084.wav	3.20	However, the approach is not believed to be hostile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_085.wav	2.78	Change will however have to be in euros.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_086.wav	2.39	It was a big departure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_087.wav	1.71	Does it matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_088.wav	2.09	How do you take them away ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_089.wav	2.48	However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_090.wav	1.96	After the match, do you ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_091.wav	2.86	The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_092.wav	3.37	The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_093.wav	2.91	It is open season on the Old Firm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_094.wav	3.33	The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_095.wav	2.22	I had a ball today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_096.wav	2.35	He refused to name the survivors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_097.wav	2.91	That time is not now, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_098.wav	2.65	We created so many chances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_099.wav	2.61	Before the game we went for a pint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_100.wav	2.05	Our house was very small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_101.wav	4.44	It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_102.wav	2.26	It became difficult for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_103.wav	2.05	It's not a lack of effort.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_104.wav	3.12	It is a total and utter change of culture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_105.wav	2.43	He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_107.wav	2.14	They will notice a difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_108.wav	2.43	Football is a passion for many.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_109.wav	2.44	New Year will be very busy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_110.wav	2.52	There's still plenty time left.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_111.wav	2.18	The result is a vacuum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_112.wav	2.86	I've heard this stuff about the markets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_113.wav	2.22	You can spend money on housing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_114.wav	2.94	The hearing was due to continue today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_115.wav	2.52	I can't even get into the A team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_116.wav	2.99	In addition, investor choice is reduced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_117.wav	2.73	But his attendance is not guaranteed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_118.wav	2.43	Three hours later, the man was free.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_119.wav	2.18	Which can happen any time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_120.wav	2.27	The colours are very pretty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_121.wav	1.84	He is a lovely man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_122.wav	2.48	Becoming a father was wonderful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_123.wav	1.88	I was on a roll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_124.wav	3.16	The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_125.wav	3.33	Something will be done by corporate bodies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_126.wav	2.78	He said to give a local injection.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_127.wav	2.69	They made such decisions in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_128.wav	2.09	You are a gambling man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_129.wav	2.01	Before it was an ordeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_130.wav	2.48	I love the spectacle of cinema.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_131.wav	2.09	We will try to find someone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_132.wav	2.18	They could use a boost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_133.wav	2.35	She died at her home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_134.wav	2.82	I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_135.wav	2.69	I enjoy the creative process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_136.wav	3.37	But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_137.wav	3.03	Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_138.wav	2.09	It was a piece of art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_139.wav	2.39	That view has not altered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_140.wav	2.52	It's all change at Kilmarnock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_141.wav	2.43	So I got a blood test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_142.wav	2.39	It has become a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_143.wav	2.56	The whole industry is a shambles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_144.wav	2.52	Like the others, he was arrested.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_145.wav	2.48	We will provide immediate access.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_146.wav	2.44	He could do nothing about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_147.wav	2.44	We have a clean bill of health.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_148.wav	4.35	Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_149.wav	2.39	I was shaking on the blocks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_151.wav	2.99	It was by the numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_152.wav	2.52	It would seem a natural progression.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_153.wav	3.12	This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_154.wav	2.86	This action reflects a slump in bookings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_155.wav	3.16	Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_156.wav	2.22	It was a funny feeling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_157.wav	2.26	I'm afraid to say anything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_158.wav	2.05	We did what we had to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_159.wav	2.09	It's not like us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_161.wav	2.99	It is not a financial issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_162.wav	2.39	I have got a wife to feed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_163.wav	3.03	Seven people were later detained by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_164.wav	3.16	The striker needed attention before he could resume.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_165.wav	2.48	We have a budget in March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_166.wav	2.56	He is not a team captain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_167.wav	2.82	Greenwood said he was happy with that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_168.wav	3.59	Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_169.wav	3.08	It opens the door to the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_170.wav	2.18	That is not the case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_172.wav	1.96	It's nice to be nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_173.wav	1.80	They could not match it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_174.wav	1.45	Are they free ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_175.wav	1.49	What are they for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_176.wav	1.88	Is there a waiting list ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_177.wav	2.44	Do they think anyone else wants them ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_178.wav	1.67	So what happens next ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_179.wav	2.78	Had this been common practice ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_180.wav	2.27	What do they want us to do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_181.wav	2.91	At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_182.wav	2.31	One season, they might do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_183.wav	3.29	I feel like my game has come a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_184.wav	2.22	The Hibs manager is no fool.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_185.wav	3.97	It is not either national standards or local control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_186.wav	2.77	City sentiment is in his favour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_187.wav	2.43	The hotel was now for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_188.wav	2.69	We are the gateway to justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_189.wav	2.52	Tomorrow is a new day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_190.wav	2.78	It makes no influence on the public.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_191.wav	2.56	Each case is treated on merit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_192.wav	2.27	I have spoken to head office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_193.wav	2.22	Says the Duke of York.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_194.wav	2.14	I had too much to drink.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_195.wav	2.69	As many as the market will support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_196.wav	2.86	They need to look after themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_197.wav	2.35	That is a waste of energy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_198.wav	3.67	The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_199.wav	4.36	It could be argued that the council was pushed to the brink.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_200.wav	2.14	I had a train to catch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_201.wav	2.65	It shows the strength of the roots.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_202.wav	2.90	However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_203.wav	2.74	This youngster is so exciting!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_204.wav	3.58	We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_205.wav	2.43	It caused a lot of upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_206.wav	2.86	Motorists will buy passes in advance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_207.wav	2.22	My duty is to win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_208.wav	2.69	Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_209.wav	4.53	On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_210.wav	2.44	No details of the talks were given.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_211.wav	2.39	This will be our new beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_212.wav	2.90	They have the cash and the fire power.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_213.wav	2.90	The service from the other players was super.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_214.wav	3.16	The early physical reports were clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_215.wav	2.30	Tommy is not a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_216.wav	3.24	The sanctions are about collective punishment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_217.wav	2.82	John Daly has a burning ambition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_218.wav	2.52	A deadline is still essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_219.wav	2.78	You have caught a serial killer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_220.wav	2.26	You are a great player.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_221.wav	2.73	I won't make an official complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_222.wav	2.86	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_223.wav	3.03	They are looking at a flotation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_224.wav	2.60	Which isn't a bad idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_225.wav	2.69	There is no quick fix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_226.wav	2.35	There was a lot of resentment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_227.wav	2.22	That might help a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_228.wav	2.74	From there, they can go anywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_229.wav	2.73	Death is outside the language.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_230.wav	2.82	I had relied on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_231.wav	2.61	The course has helped a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_232.wav	2.60	I'm just a regular person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_233.wav	2.61	It had all been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_234.wav	3.16	His third goal was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_235.wav	3.03	Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_236.wav	2.57	I am considered a teenager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_237.wav	3.29	Anyway, the job will be part-time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_238.wav	3.38	This will secure the future of our industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_239.wav	4.18	For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_240.wav	3.67	People should make their own decisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_241.wav	2.86	They said that they stood by their statement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_242.wav	2.52	You have to do your research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_243.wav	2.56	We played them off the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_244.wav	2.22	If it doesn't, it doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_245.wav	2.65	Truth is the child of time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_246.wav	2.95	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_247.wav	2.57	Was everything done to save people ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_249.wav	2.60	Do I think about them often ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_250.wav	3.63	That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_251.wav	3.63	A small number of new jobs will also be created.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_252.wav	2.48	It's important to get it right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_253.wav	2.56	Pensions are a long-term investment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_254.wav	2.52	Those overseas offices were great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_255.wav	3.76	On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_256.wav	3.12	Half of young people had had contact with the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_257.wav	1.84	I was just a kid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_258.wav	2.56	He was good, but not that good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_259.wav	2.39	It was quite a new prescription.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_260.wav	2.14	It is very hard for her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_261.wav	3.59	He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_262.wav	3.89	It is believed the size of the settlement has not been finalised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_263.wav	3.54	We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_264.wav	3.89	Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_265.wav	2.43	You can feel at home in China.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_266.wav	3.12	Either way, the investor retains the premium.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_267.wav	3.88	The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_268.wav	3.12	Washington is consumed by the crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_269.wav	3.12	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_270.wav	2.77	But they were never expected to last.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_271.wav	3.63	However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_272.wav	2.48	The capital costs are modest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_273.wav	1.88	I told you I was ill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_274.wav	2.31	He will go on the bench.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_275.wav	2.65	That could be in place by next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_276.wav	2.48	We accept the new rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_277.wav	2.22	We run within the law.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_278.wav	2.31	We have the moral high ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_279.wav	1.97	He took over our lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_280.wav	2.44	It has all been done in secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_281.wav	2.05	They must play for each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_282.wav	3.29	Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_283.wav	2.61	She always wanted her own way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_284.wav	2.56	I realised I was lucky to have it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_285.wav	2.01	They can leave at any time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_286.wav	2.35	Much of the equipment was new.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_287.wav	2.56	Blair also had a penalty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_288.wav	3.50	Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_289.wav	2.82	Frankly, we should all have such problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_290.wav	3.54	It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_291.wav	1.97	My body is a wreck.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_292.wav	2.22	She failed in her action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_293.wav	2.48	Stephen will get his first cap.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_294.wav	2.82	The partnership was set up during the summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_295.wav	2.52	And that match was played in June.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_296.wav	2.01	I saw it at a ruck.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_297.wav	2.27	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_298.wav	2.05	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_299.wav	1.92	how do you get it back ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_300.wav	1.92	What are you not good at ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_301.wav	2.14	I think, therefore I am ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_302.wav	2.86	It's all designed to speed up the service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_303.wav	2.86	Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_304.wav	2.39	He will address the nation this evening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_305.wav	3.03	They have shown a great desire and attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_306.wav	2.69	Maloney is an engaging talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_307.wav	2.65	The rescue package is public money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_308.wav	2.52	I was there five months ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_309.wav	2.61	I am a retailer by nature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_310.wav	2.43	His job was not advertised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_311.wav	2.05	We can work all night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_312.wav	2.78	It was really very frightening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_313.wav	2.44	It was an excellent performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_314.wav	2.27	The answer is with ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_315.wav	1.71	And we can do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_316.wav	2.22	These figures are truly awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_317.wav	2.14	That is the real test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_318.wav	2.27	They have to be addressed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_319.wav	3.08	It aims to produce its report before Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_320.wav	2.65	Cast Away now on general release.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_321.wav	2.18	All winners should be tested.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_322.wav	1.75	I can live with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_323.wav	2.01	A lot has been written.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_324.wav	1.67	And he goes with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_325.wav	2.27	The law will take its course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_326.wav	2.52	This is a historic occasion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_327.wav	2.61	This ruling is a farce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_328.wav	2.39	After some discussion they did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_329.wav	2.22	I am not obsessed with sex.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_330.wav	2.44	I didn't have the reply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_331.wav	3.20	Public opinion was split on the proposal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_332.wav	2.05	These days will be back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_333.wav	2.05	You may have a short memory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_335.wav	2.31	There was no time scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_336.wav	2.60	That decision has already been made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_337.wav	3.20	In his absence, the council adopted the change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_338.wav	2.09	The game is now open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_339.wav	3.12	The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_340.wav	2.14	Even the one she loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_341.wav	2.31	Finally, he paid for the movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_342.wav	2.01	It was almost too much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_343.wav	2.99	Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_344.wav	2.78	The idea was first mooted a year ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_345.wav	2.09	Three years ago he would have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_346.wav	2.60	It's a policy which has worked for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_347.wav	2.78	We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_348.wav	2.31	The confidence isn't there now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_349.wav	2.43	We put our bid in last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_350.wav	2.69	A great deal has been achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_351.wav	2.82	He had no previous convictions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_352.wav	2.48	Alex Ferguson is the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_353.wav	1.41	What do we do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_354.wav	2.05	Why do it otherwise ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_355.wav	2.65	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_356.wav	2.14	So, did she meet him ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_357.wav	2.82	George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_358.wav	3.97	Like his acting, it was an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_359.wav	2.35	Scotland is the home of golf.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_360.wav	2.13	They have broken that promise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_361.wav	2.91	From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_362.wav	2.18	It's only a matter of scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_363.wav	2.22	We must put a marker down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_364.wav	2.05	She said they would appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_365.wav	2.14	There is no deal as yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_366.wav	2.69	It's as wide as a church in here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_367.wav	3.12	The work with Alison was a great experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_368.wav	2.26	It was like a weekly wage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_369.wav	2.27	We are a Scottish company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_370.wav	2.18	They will fight for everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_371.wav	2.22	The pair are very much in love.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_372.wav	2.78	We used to keep our business rates.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_373.wav	2.91	Everything is now in place for Manchester.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_374.wav	3.25	It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_375.wav	2.18	Everyone could see the joke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_376.wav	2.44	All would be under threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_377.wav	2.86	I understand the frustration of the fans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_378.wav	2.78	On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_379.wav	2.48	The seller was not revealed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_380.wav	2.39	People are on the alert.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_381.wav	4.10	I can confirm that Miss Deacon has received a threatening phone call.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_382.wav	3.59	We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_383.wav	2.09	A review is under way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_384.wav	2.14	They know it'll be fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_385.wav	2.95	This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_386.wav	2.52	Clark is back on top form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_387.wav	2.86	Motion described it as a unique event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_388.wav	2.31	It brought in new management.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_389.wav	2.65	My view has now completely changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_390.wav	2.18	She is in their hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_391.wav	2.69	The following day I used the story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_392.wav	2.99	However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_393.wav	2.65	The Cabinet is split over the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_394.wav	2.69	Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_395.wav	2.43	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_396.wav	2.99	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_397.wav	1.92	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_398.wav	1.71	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_399.wav	1.88	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_400.wav	2.22	It certainly appeared that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_401.wav	3.16	I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_402.wav	3.08	We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_403.wav	2.73	I will be able to say in a couple of weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_404.wav	2.35	I remain a buyer of the shares.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_405.wav	3.29	But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_406.wav	2.35	It had been on the cards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_407.wav	2.44	He seems to be used to the attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_408.wav	1.92	The trick is to try it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_409.wav	2.78	I would love to think that she could win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_410.wav	1.93	He may have a point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_411.wav	3.50	The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_412.wav	3.71	He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_413.wav	2.39	He is on the wrong side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_414.wav	2.48	My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_415.wav	2.26	I've got my own ideas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_416.wav	2.14	I never had a childhood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_417.wav	3.25	Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_418.wav	1.92	I think it's a miracle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_419.wav	4.31	They were not complacent in any way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_420.wav	2.05	They did the right thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_421.wav	2.22	He will be judged by his actions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_422.wav	2.65	The fate of the rest is unknown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_423.wav	2.52	It is an absolute nonsense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_424.wav	3.80	Young families accounted for a growing share of the trade.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_425.wav	2.90	Sadly, the surface was a nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_426.wav	2.73	Everything in golf is a balance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_427.wav	2.73	It is a case of pity for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_428.wav	2.86	I believe the gap is nearly there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_429.wav	3.16	Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_430.wav	2.60	We've got a good management record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_431.wav	2.77	It was that bad, that low.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_432.wav	2.26	Paris is not only young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_433.wav	3.59	However, the downturn has forced the overdraft request.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_434.wav	2.74	But you can go beyond that condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_435.wav	3.72	But we have built a platform for next season.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_436.wav	2.39	It looked like a war zone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_437.wav	2.82	He said current trading was strong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_438.wav	2.22	I chose to make a film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_439.wav	2.73	I can tell you Labour is fighting to win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_440.wav	2.65	But by that time, it was too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_441.wav	2.44	The damage is all inside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_442.wav	2.86	Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_443.wav	2.31	We would have concerns about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_444.wav	2.48	I know the worry over Iraq.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_445.wav	2.48	Taxes may need to rise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_446.wav	3.63	Equally the employee could claim a public interest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_447.wav	2.86	Phil Mickelson did that last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_448.wav	2.69	No options are excluded at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_449.wav	3.89	The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_450.wav	1.80	We are going for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_451.wav	3.84	Miss Jackson was not present to put her case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_452.wav	2.18	It is a cause for concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_453.wav	2.73	The weather in the area of the crash was severe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_454.wav	2.86	I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_455.wav	2.05	He deserved a red card.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_456.wav	2.57	They were not even allowed to see them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_457.wav	2.26	And she is very clear on this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_458.wav	2.27	And it covers the spectrum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_459.wav	2.22	Dennis was not so sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_460.wav	2.39	The chief constable has retired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_461.wav	2.86	It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_462.wav	2.65	It is a crisis, without a doubt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_463.wav	1.92	Not if you know the person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_464.wav	2.95	Her body was found about four miles from the car.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_465.wav	2.90	I was all image and no substance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_466.wav	2.31	The boys are mentally focused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_467.wav	2.43	It can all be done over the phone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_468.wav	1.75	The bill would be massive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_469.wav	3.12	When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_470.wav	2.52	Neither woman has been named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_471.wav	2.99	He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_472.wav	2.35	We live by the rule of law.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_473.wav	2.91	They make a selective perception process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_474.wav	2.01	He was a shooting star.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_475.wav	2.52	I could feel the blood on my face.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_476.wav	2.22	I am a committed European.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_477.wav	2.52	Analysts said the offer was fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_478.wav	2.99	These people attack the core of my beliefs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_479.wav	2.60	Then came the farewell to Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_480.wav	2.05	It is a vicious circle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_481.wav	1.96	He will be advised by me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_482.wav	2.09	Winning a medal is a dream.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_483.wav	2.10	We had to add value.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_484.wav	2.22	That is the bottom line.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_485.wav	2.30	It happens on an annual basis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_486.wav	3.67	However, he emphasised the bank was satisfied with progress.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_487.wav	1.92	We have to go for a win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_488.wav	2.05	It worked well in Monaco.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_489.wav	2.05	Something has got to change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_490.wav	2.60	I had it before the final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_491.wav	2.01	Our fans have been marvellous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_492.wav	2.22	The BBC was a disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_493.wav	2.65	I would put my money on Peter Donald.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_494.wav	2.99	It was still there, but right at the end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_495.wav	2.22	The Prime Minister has been in touch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_496.wav	2.22	They never gave up hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_497.wav	2.01	He had planned to sell it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_498.wav	1.75	I was ready for this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_499.wav	2.65	In fact, we were all over the shop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_500.wav	2.57	A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_501.wav	2.69	Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_502.wav	2.26	I stayed away from the defence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p236\p236_503.wav	3.20	Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_001.wav	3.33	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_002.wav	5.21	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_003.wav	8.83	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_004.wav	5.94	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_005.wav	6.87	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_006.wav	7.04	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_007.wav	5.34	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_008.wav	7.68	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_009.wav	6.79	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_010.wav	3.55	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_011.wav	7.30	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_012.wav	5.30	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_013.wav	5.80	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_014.wav	6.49	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_015.wav	5.85	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_016.wav	8.53	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_017.wav	5.55	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_018.wav	6.53	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_019.wav	9.13	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_020.wav	4.69	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_021.wav	8.32	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_023.wav	12.12	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_024.wav	8.15	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_025.wav	3.72	He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_026.wav	2.78	They should be so lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_027.wav	2.18	I have a theory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_028.wav	5.00	They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_029.wav	4.87	The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_030.wav	5.04	However, the following year the cancer returned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_031.wav	5.16	We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_032.wav	3.16	There's a story, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_033.wav	2.82	This is the window.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_034.wav	4.82	I think a move would create a lot of interest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_035.wav	4.65	I'd like to continue that record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_036.wav	2.48	They're just different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_037.wav	2.65	It was clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_038.wav	3.80	It is not for any other purpose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_039.wav	3.46	The problem is the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_040.wav	2.39	It's a great thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_041.wav	2.82	He did not know his daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_042.wav	3.46	This film will be totally awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_043.wav	3.71	That is a break with tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_044.wav	2.60	It's the only thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_045.wav	3.03	It is so sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_046.wav	4.57	There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_047.wav	1.67	It is urgent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_048.wav	2.43	I feel pretty good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_049.wav	4.70	We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_050.wav	1.93	It is bizarre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_051.wav	2.26	That should do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_052.wav	4.78	The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_053.wav	3.12	She looked so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_054.wav	3.80	It has been a horrible, horrible time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_055.wav	2.22	Life is good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_056.wav	4.91	No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_057.wav	4.74	I was inspired by two things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_058.wav	5.04	For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_059.wav	3.50	We were surprised to see the photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_060.wav	4.40	New York is expected to come to a standstill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_061.wav	4.23	I've had six days of rehearsal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_062.wav	3.84	None has ever been found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_063.wav	2.94	It's a real challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_064.wav	3.03	You do not change overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_065.wav	2.60	Art is extra.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_066.wav	4.36	The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_067.wav	6.57	Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_068.wav	5.55	Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_069.wav	4.95	It is like a river running by my home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_070.wav	4.78	We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_071.wav	2.95	Try to save us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_072.wav	4.49	The end result is precisely the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_073.wav	4.57	There is an element of racism in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_074.wav	4.52	Painful, but only because it's true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_075.wav	4.01	I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_076.wav	3.63	The price cuts are really exciting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_077.wav	3.46	IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_078.wav	3.58	It is a terrible place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_079.wav	4.22	Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_080.wav	3.29	It may well have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_081.wav	3.67	It's all going to clear the debt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_082.wav	3.46	I first met him last summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_083.wav	2.39	He is driven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_084.wav	4.14	Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_085.wav	2.52	Someone who cares
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_086.wav	2.05	It's never too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_087.wav	4.44	Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_088.wav	5.59	Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_089.wav	3.76	Now the system is right behind us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_090.wav	5.85	Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_091.wav	2.52	Today I couldn't run on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_092.wav	3.37	However, it did not end that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_093.wav	2.65	We must look forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_094.wav	5.42	I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_095.wav	3.76	Until you hit the big games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_096.wav	2.78	We could not get any possession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_097.wav	1.96	I love the Dome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_098.wav	3.72	I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_099.wav	4.01	By that time, however, it was already too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_100.wav	3.59	They were outside the circle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_101.wav	4.01	A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_102.wav	2.48	But it was a pleasure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_103.wav	4.27	It was some time before she found out he was safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_104.wav	3.59	We want to get to the final, anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_105.wav	3.16	I didn't play well last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_106.wav	6.40	Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_107.wav	3.80	They had to be cut from the wreckage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_108.wav	3.88	I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_109.wav	2.31	It is normal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_110.wav	2.95	Further protests are likely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_111.wav	2.22	It's in his blood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_112.wav	2.82	Who would be right ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_113.wav	1.92	It's a shame.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_114.wav	2.05	I came to complete.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_117.wav	3.93	This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_118.wav	3.50	On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_119.wav	4.10	Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_120.wav	2.18	Does this mean.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_121.wav	3.50	They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_122.wav	3.59	It is a delight on every level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_123.wav	5.33	An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_124.wav	3.20	I felt very strongly that England should have it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_125.wav	3.54	But it took a lot of bottle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_126.wav	3.33	I thought it was a fantastic game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_127.wav	2.05	I'm so angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_128.wav	3.80	Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_129.wav	3.46	She really suffered for her art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_130.wav	4.44	It's terrible that he has died the same way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_131.wav	5.08	Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_132.wav	4.10	Offered the gold medal, he declined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_133.wav	2.60	Who will attend ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_134.wav	5.38	The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_135.wav	5.12	It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_136.wav	3.80	They made such decisions in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_137.wav	2.90	It's perfectly feasible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_138.wav	2.22	They took a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_139.wav	5.08	The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_140.wav	3.80	The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_141.wav	7.26	On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_142.wav	3.16	He has the edge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_143.wav	3.72	Three penalties were given.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_144.wav	4.69	It seems so long since I did the exams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_145.wav	5.38	In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_146.wav	4.18	She hopes to study in Britain one day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_147.wav	5.59	We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_148.wav	2.61	He is severe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_149.wav	2.74	She died at her home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_150.wav	2.35	Is that Titanic ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_151.wav	2.52	The idea is simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_153.wav	3.80	He will emerge as a world leader.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_154.wav	4.10	It opens the door to the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_155.wav	3.97	It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_156.wav	2.10	It is huge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_157.wav	6.45	The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_159.wav	3.37	It is not normal practice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_160.wav	5.29	Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_161.wav	4.70	We also enjoyed a lot of support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_162.wav	5.55	It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_163.wav	2.73	We are now up against it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_164.wav	2.74	I was in daily contact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_165.wav	4.40	He was the Bill Gates of theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_166.wav	4.10	The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_167.wav	3.67	Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_168.wav	3.41	They should stop the bombing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_169.wav	4.95	Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_170.wav	3.97	It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_171.wav	3.97	I was in the train station overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_172.wav	3.59	We knew we had the goal we wanted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_173.wav	3.42	He is keen to stay in public service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_174.wav	3.97	I looked again at its vision for a Scottish Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_175.wav	3.63	Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_176.wav	3.29	Does that put pressure on us ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_177.wav	3.50	The release attracted little attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_178.wav	3.93	Waiting times for these services are too long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_179.wav	2.18	He was a crazy man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_180.wav	5.50	A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_181.wav	4.57	Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_182.wav	3.97	One season, they might do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_183.wav	4.40	First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_184.wav	2.86	This is a sad day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_185.wav	5.38	The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_186.wav	3.20	The hotel was now for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_187.wav	6.40	I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_188.wav	3.76	Government will intervene.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_189.wav	3.46	Four policemen were wounded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_190.wav	3.59	They receive a high profile in the media.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_191.wav	2.43	It's a joke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_192.wav	3.38	Miller was every bit as happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_193.wav	2.78	I wish I could say something.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_194.wav	3.37	It is tough, but possible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_195.wav	4.27	I've got good news and bad news for you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_196.wav	5.25	We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_198.wav	3.59	If the director is with you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_199.wav	5.12	The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_200.wav	4.23	It is a case of taking a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_201.wav	5.85	The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_202.wav	3.03	Our strategy is straightforward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_203.wav	2.18	Is that success ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_204.wav	4.74	Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_205.wav	2.60	Tommy is not a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_206.wav	4.70	The sisters also became the two top players in the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_207.wav	3.59	He was also married with two children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_208.wav	4.48	I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_210.wav	3.85	It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_211.wav	5.38	After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_212.wav	2.78	I don't want to use it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_213.wav	3.37	Now, it's all right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_214.wav	2.95	There was an e-mail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_215.wav	4.18	Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_216.wav	2.86	It is a gamble.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_217.wav	2.99	He is slightly confused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_218.wav	3.76	She should not be blamed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_219.wav	2.69	I began to pray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_220.wav	3.76	I had decided to quit the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_221.wav	4.70	I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_222.wav	3.72	By hard work, is the answer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_223.wav	3.16	The FBI could become involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_224.wav	5.29	However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_225.wav	5.80	On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_226.wav	5.51	He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_227.wav	3.46	You have to do your research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_228.wav	3.58	William Hague delighted his party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_229.wav	5.34	Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_230.wav	3.25	Clearly, the stakes are high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_231.wav	3.80	It's a question of creating a future awareness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_232.wav	3.08	I am immensely sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_233.wav	4.01	I'd never seen a play about me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_234.wav	4.95	It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_235.wav	3.16	I can't wait to meet him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_236.wav	5.68	Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_237.wav	3.50	They are the innocent victims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_238.wav	5.34	Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_239.wav	4.01	The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_240.wav	2.22	You take a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_241.wav	4.27	They tried to give her advice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_242.wav	4.23	Police later said the scheme would end in November.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_243.wav	2.05	It's a dead end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_244.wav	3.12	We are in the hat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_245.wav	3.54	Of course, that is not the whole story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_246.wav	2.26	They should come forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_247.wav	3.46	It is not the message alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_248.wav	4.87	Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_249.wav	4.74	He says that he is no different from any other man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_250.wav	3.29	It's quite a line-up !
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_251.wav	3.07	It's a lovely, lovely film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_252.wav	5.42	It would still have been a good film, but very different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_253.wav	3.12	We were extremely poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_254.wav	4.65	I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_255.wav	4.61	We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_256.wav	4.35	It would appear that it has not been a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_257.wav	4.01	Chambers said he would accept the place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_258.wav	4.19	Both reports appear in the British Medical Journal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_259.wav	2.91	You can feel at home in China.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_260.wav	3.71	Our decision making was poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_262.wav	5.81	The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_263.wav	3.29	They are different types.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_264.wav	2.05	There's the mix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_265.wav	3.59	There will be widespread support on all sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_266.wav	5.12	Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_267.wav	5.33	Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_268.wav	3.93	That could be in place by next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_270.wav	3.16	Special measures were needed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_271.wav	5.33	It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_272.wav	2.74	This is a big club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_273.wav	4.14	Blair is very positive at European Councils.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_274.wav	5.51	One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_275.wav	4.82	I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_276.wav	2.90	It is also very valuable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_277.wav	5.59	The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_278.wav	3.29	The warning is timely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_279.wav	5.80	It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_280.wav	5.63	That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_281.wav	2.65	There is no link.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_282.wav	3.50	This is a question of Islam.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_283.wav	5.72	That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_284.wav	5.93	Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_285.wav	3.03	Immediate action must be taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_286.wav	4.61	Frankly, we should all have such problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_287.wav	2.05	We're in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_288.wav	1.75	You know the type.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_289.wav	2.73	She failed in her action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_290.wav	6.10	He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_291.wav	5.72	However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_292.wav	3.24	They seem to get away with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_293.wav	2.78	People have no choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_294.wav	4.40	He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_295.wav	3.03	I saw it at a ruck.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_296.wav	5.46	I intended to look for another club on loan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_297.wav	3.89	Mr Campbell received a phone call.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_298.wav	4.01	Holland won by five wickets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_299.wav	5.51	She said she could not believe that they had run away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_300.wav	6.02	It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_301.wav	2.86	That could change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_302.wav	1.88	He should have won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_303.wav	2.05	Who can predict ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_304.wav	4.36	The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_305.wav	4.99	We have to sort it out ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_306.wav	2.39	I was the sheep.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_307.wav	2.82	Graeme was prepared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_308.wav	4.18	However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_309.wav	2.73	It is a road of death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_310.wav	3.24	This is a war over our home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_311.wav	4.27	In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_312.wav	5.55	The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_313.wav	3.12	They were on holiday in Egypt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_314.wav	5.04	I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_315.wav	2.73	SCOTLAND has shown the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_316.wav	5.04	It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_317.wav	2.35	It is no surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_318.wav	3.38	We want to play at the worlds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_320.wav	2.78	They were fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_321.wav	3.76	I never thought it would take this long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_322.wav	3.46	They wanted the club to make money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_323.wav	3.20	It should be equal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_325.wav	4.23	We are very strongly behind the bid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_326.wav	4.10	In the old days, it was easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_327.wav	5.34	The parents will have a great time, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_328.wav	4.87	It is a job creation scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_329.wav	3.16	I am so upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_330.wav	4.61	Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_331.wav	4.35	Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_332.wav	5.16	It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_333.wav	3.80	He was then replaced by Ross.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_334.wav	4.01	I saw some good things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_335.wav	2.31	He can do no wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_337.wav	6.53	Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_338.wav	4.31	There was a bit of urgency in the second half.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_339.wav	2.90	They haven't got a hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_340.wav	3.97	It has moved on in the last week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_341.wav	5.21	I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_342.wav	4.95	That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_343.wav	6.23	He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_344.wav	3.54	The train was on time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_345.wav	5.12	They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_346.wav	5.12	The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_347.wav	3.16	Indeed, it was magical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_348.wav	2.90	Look at the witnesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_349.wav	2.60	Nobody else was with me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_350.wav	2.73	The composer will conduct.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p237\p237_351.wav	2.91	It should be scrapped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_001.wav	3.12	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_002.wav	4.53	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_003.wav	8.32	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_004.wav	6.49	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_005.wav	8.49	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_006.wav	7.73	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_007.wav	5.68	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_008.wav	9.56	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_009.wav	6.15	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_010.wav	4.06	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_011.wav	8.88	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_012.wav	6.23	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_013.wav	5.68	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_014.wav	6.28	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_015.wav	7.94	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_016.wav	8.41	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_017.wav	4.75	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_018.wav	7.43	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_019.wav	9.39	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_020.wav	5.72	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_021.wav	10.67	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_022.wav	8.07	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_023.wav	12.98	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_024.wav	8.37	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_025.wav	4.36	Smoking is also very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_026.wav	3.63	The first appeared to be successful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_027.wav	3.54	We must convince the citizens.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_028.wav	3.25	There was a rush of water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_029.wav	4.74	Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_030.wav	3.46	Further management changes are planned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_031.wav	4.27	Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_032.wav	2.90	The staff are very good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_033.wav	4.44	Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_034.wav	4.65	Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_035.wav	5.25	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_036.wav	4.01	Let there be no doubt about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_037.wav	4.27	The ambition this year is to improve on last.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_038.wav	5.12	Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_039.wav	4.02	And so was a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_040.wav	3.46	I remember that day well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_041.wav	4.18	She became a heroine of my childhood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_042.wav	3.89	We want to get back into the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_043.wav	3.84	The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_044.wav	4.99	It is about regular committed giving which is the real attraction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_045.wav	4.31	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_046.wav	4.01	Separate approvals would be needed for these.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_047.wav	4.40	They have shown a great desire and attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_048.wav	4.48	Among them are many criminals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_049.wav	4.35	It comes from reflection or thinking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_050.wav	3.24	The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_051.wav	3.50	And they removed a Borderer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_052.wav	3.08	He is too weak to move.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_053.wav	2.48	Does it matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_054.wav	2.86	How do you take them away ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_055.wav	3.59	However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_056.wav	2.99	After the match, do you ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_057.wav	3.07	Has the conflict started ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_058.wav	2.90	Have I really come to this ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_059.wav	3.80	They desperately want some stability.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_060.wav	2.35	Well, he is an artist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_061.wav	2.78	We work for the athlete.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_062.wav	2.39	He looks like an Afghan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_063.wav	2.69	Everything else is a bonus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_064.wav	2.52	He will need that machine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_065.wav	3.84	We hadn't really taken that seriously before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_066.wav	2.61	It's the performance we want.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_067.wav	3.33	Then they scored two goals to win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_068.wav	3.08	In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_069.wav	3.76	The partnership was set up during the summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_070.wav	4.82	The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_071.wav	4.40	Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_072.wav	2.52	I had relied on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_073.wav	2.69	And then there's the racial hassle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_074.wav	2.86	We felt it was sufficient.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_075.wav	3.84	The wingers must have felt the cold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_076.wav	3.07	I am relishing the challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_077.wav	2.95	I have made that offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_078.wav	3.88	No plans for projects are yet in place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_079.wav	3.63	But the organisers refused to worry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_080.wav	3.12	We have to keep our clients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_081.wav	2.95	We should be able to cope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_082.wav	5.12	The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_083.wav	4.10	The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_084.wav	3.97	He's very young and very keen to do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_085.wav	3.25	It is somewhere to be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_086.wav	2.69	We should all be grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_087.wav	2.35	We will pay their bills.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_088.wav	3.46	It was exactly four months away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_089.wav	3.93	This is equally relevant to the landowner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_090.wav	2.90	He thought she was amazing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_091.wav	2.86	The result is utterly compelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_092.wav	3.76	Final proposals will be published in February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_093.wav	2.73	He seems to have everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_094.wav	3.50	There can be no compromise on welfare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_095.wav	3.67	It wasn't possible to relax.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_096.wav	3.12	He was at home with his pals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_097.wav	3.80	I was very pleased with them today, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_098.wav	3.16	Maybe this battle has been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_099.wav	3.20	Then followed a bout of flu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_100.wav	3.63	Both sides have been hit by injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_101.wav	4.70	It will take a few years before we see the full benefit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_102.wav	3.37	It's very dangerous for markets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_103.wav	2.61	The fans would love it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_104.wav	3.25	That would be the case with Dundee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_105.wav	6.23	Brian Wilson is a former Member to watch award winner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_106.wav	3.16	Talk of a crisis is absurd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_107.wav	3.16	Their mandate is to target inflation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_108.wav	3.46	We have thought about doing lots of things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_109.wav	4.27	England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_110.wav	6.10	This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_111.wav	4.74	After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_112.wav	3.46	Harrowing is easy, after all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_113.wav	3.54	Those people must be accountable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_114.wav	3.12	If they liked it then I'll be happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_115.wav	3.80	It's very bad timing, but it's happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_116.wav	4.65	Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_117.wav	4.69	Many others are subjected to violence by men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_118.wav	3.03	It's going to be epic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_119.wav	3.54	What form did that take ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_120.wav	2.22	Are they free ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_121.wav	2.31	What are they for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_122.wav	2.48	Is there a waiting list ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_123.wav	3.80	Do they think anyone else wants them ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_124.wav	3.03	So what happens next ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_125.wav	3.63	Had this been common practice ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_126.wav	2.90	What do they want us to do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_127.wav	4.70	Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_128.wav	4.23	He put some colour into Scottish history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_129.wav	2.77	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_130.wav	3.33	Potions said he would drive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_131.wav	3.67	This is a sizeable part of our business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_132.wav	3.12	Diversions were put in place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_133.wav	4.31	We're very interested in opening up in Germany.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_134.wav	4.44	The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_135.wav	5.00	No one person or small group could be singled out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_136.wav	5.21	Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_137.wav	3.67	I won't make an official complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_138.wav	4.06	Monty is great in his own backyard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_139.wav	4.48	Brown also believes in Walker's innocence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_140.wav	4.31	This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_141.wav	5.38	Even the winning club was within seconds of disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_142.wav	4.95	The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_143.wav	3.29	But it looks good for next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_144.wav	3.84	All the employees are redundant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_145.wav	6.23	His claims were criticised by Chief Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Smith.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_146.wav	4.10	Four meetings have previously been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_147.wav	5.89	Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_148.wav	5.72	The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_149.wav	3.12	And they all have a vote.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_150.wav	3.38	It is a vicious circle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_151.wav	3.71	Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_152.wav	4.87	Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_154.wav	3.84	They make a selective perception process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_155.wav	2.95	That's what happened against Ayr.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_156.wav	3.46	Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_157.wav	3.29	The following are the principal provisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_158.wav	4.35	But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_159.wav	4.18	Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_160.wav	4.06	His job was not advertised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_161.wav	3.67	He was just like a godfather to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_162.wav	3.71	The milk industry is in turmoil.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_163.wav	4.74	He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_164.wav	4.01	Yet the survey has been cautious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_165.wav	4.69	The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_166.wav	3.80	YOU cannot blame the turnout.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_167.wav	2.99	We can't get over it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_168.wav	3.03	They almost achieved a draw.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_169.wav	2.60	I can see it now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_170.wav	2.95	This is a step backwards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_171.wav	3.24	I've no idea how it works.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_172.wav	2.99	We continue to hold the shares.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_173.wav	3.38	The festivals will be about having fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_174.wav	4.61	Emergency services were also on stand-by outside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_175.wav	4.52	Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_176.wav	3.80	Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_177.wav	3.46	The changes took effect from June.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_178.wav	4.95	Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_179.wav	3.16	You can spend money on housing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_180.wav	3.03	Since then, things have improved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_181.wav	5.04	We're very fortunate to have these new products to focus on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_182.wav	4.70	The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_183.wav	4.06	Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_184.wav	3.16	They keep the atmosphere in mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_185.wav	3.63	But we could only help a handful of people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_186.wav	3.71	Scottish football is finally on its way back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_187.wav	3.16	This is a frightening development.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_188.wav	3.93	He is survived by his wife and two sons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_189.wav	3.12	This should begin in October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_190.wav	2.86	You just have to accept.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_191.wav	4.05	There is no evidence that these people are helpful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_192.wav	3.67	The Yugoslav army will still be there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_193.wav	2.65	The squad is too small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_194.wav	4.10	He has had success at every level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_195.wav	2.91	This Patton will also return.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_196.wav	3.54	Tiger is not the norm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_197.wav	3.33	His words were not audible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_198.wav	3.42	You are a gambling man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_199.wav	2.05	Did he trip ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_200.wav	3.12	Does that put pressure on us ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_201.wav	1.96	Did it work ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_202.wav	3.20	Do you think we are a top nation ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_203.wav	2.69	Is our children learning ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_204.wav	2.52	How independent is that ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_206.wav	2.82	Truth is the child of time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_207.wav	2.69	There was a fine line to tread.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_208.wav	3.07	The refund is fully justified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_209.wav	3.84	Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_211.wav	3.33	But experts have disputed that statistic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_212.wav	2.52	It is time for confession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_213.wav	3.50	He has many offers from the English Premiership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_214.wav	4.87	Hospital staff described his condition as serious but stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_215.wav	5.85	In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_216.wav	3.33	It was started almost by accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_217.wav	3.72	I will not take part in Edmonton.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_218.wav	2.82	We will try to find someone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_219.wav	3.24	Bottling is now the core business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_220.wav	3.33	Frankly, it was worth the booking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_221.wav	4.65	The study is expected to last until the middle of the year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_222.wav	3.54	People have been wonderful beyond belief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_223.wav	2.69	We were right to be afraid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_224.wav	4.01	The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_225.wav	3.76	That group reported just before Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_226.wav	2.60	I am considered a teenager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_227.wav	4.57	Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_228.wav	5.42	Arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_229.wav	3.50	That view has not altered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_230.wav	3.89	Its's all change at Kilmarnock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_231.wav	2.65	So I got a blood test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_232.wav	5.12	No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_233.wav	3.33	Others may have, but I'm a fighter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_234.wav	2.78	There's always the next century.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_235.wav	3.63	For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_236.wav	3.89	That proved enough to settle the home side down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_237.wav	3.42	Here was an anti supporting the Bill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_238.wav	3.89	Five years later, the deception continued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_239.wav	3.93	Analysts had a mixed reaction to the numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_240.wav	3.59	There's only one team in Ayrshire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_241.wav	4.23	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_242.wav	3.07	It is not normal practice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_243.wav	2.99	It is crucial for both teams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_244.wav	2.82	Mr Blair had done well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_245.wav	2.73	I was a lucky man tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_246.wav	3.59	Then we will face the Danish champions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_247.wav	2.86	But it couldn't happen overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_248.wav	3.33	It would seem a natural progression.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_249.wav	4.27	Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_250.wav	2.61	My Dad is a hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_251.wav	2.65	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_252.wav	3.12	was everything done to save people ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_253.wav	2.78	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_254.wav	2.77	Do I think about them often ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_255.wav	2.44	Is it in the right place ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_256.wav	3.46	This wasn't just a big crowd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_257.wav	4.10	It was a terrible combination of factors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_258.wav	2.95	This is absolutely not true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_259.wav	3.46	Arsenal refused to be evicted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_260.wav	3.97	It's about time something was done about equipment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_261.wav	2.69	They should stop the bombing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_262.wav	3.54	Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_263.wav	4.14	Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_264.wav	2.82	It is a terrible tragedy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_265.wav	3.97	The agreement remains the only show in town.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_266.wav	5.00	The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_267.wav	3.97	The strong performance is expected to continue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_268.wav	4.70	The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_269.wav	2.99	It was a bit of a tightrope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_270.wav	2.99	It's never great to finish second.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_271.wav	4.06	I'm delighted that Celtic have done so well this season.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_272.wav	3.80	Her political persuasion is no secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_273.wav	4.23	Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_274.wav	2.99	He is a right bastard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_275.wav	3.59	Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_276.wav	2.35	They could not match it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_277.wav	2.52	He is not a pathetic figure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_278.wav	4.18	The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_279.wav	2.73	I came up through the ranks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_280.wav	2.99	You've got to be vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_281.wav	3.16	First, the programme was unbalanced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_282.wav	3.07	The happiness was slightly misplaced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_283.wav	3.07	Phase one was a shambles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_284.wav	3.84	This championship is different from the other majors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_285.wav	4.10	But I was glad to see these interviews.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_286.wav	3.63	Each case is treated on merit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_287.wav	4.27	They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_288.wav	2.86	Says the Duke of York.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_289.wav	3.97	He is a serial Conservative assassin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_290.wav	3.41	We've just had it confirmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_291.wav	6.10	Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_292.wav	5.72	Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_293.wav	5.98	She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_294.wav	3.25	We've had great things in the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_295.wav	3.12	It has been recorded twice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_296.wav	2.82	But there's an upturn in the sector.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_297.wav	3.89	I'm interested in interesting work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_298.wav	2.73	They will probably come back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_299.wav	2.99	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_300.wav	2.56	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_301.wav	2.73	how do you get it back ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_302.wav	3.07	What are you not good at ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_303.wav	3.07	I think, therefore I am ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_304.wav	1.97	Who was she ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_305.wav	3.42	Motorists will buy passes in advance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_306.wav	3.41	No-one is predicting a sudden rebound.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_307.wav	3.80	Friday night was a pretty good night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_308.wav	4.70	This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_309.wav	4.40	You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_310.wav	5.29	We are trying to clarify the issues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_311.wav	4.83	I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_312.wav	3.97	Pulled a huge number of viewers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_313.wav	3.37	Movie stars are public property.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_314.wav	4.83	Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_315.wav	5.00	Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_316.wav	5.25	That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_317.wav	3.46	Here the picture is broadly stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_318.wav	3.20	Sadly, it does not end there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_319.wav	4.23	Jim has not been a problem for me at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_320.wav	4.65	Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_321.wav	4.18	We believe a third party was involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_322.wav	2.91	And we have the experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_323.wav	3.25	The early physical reports were clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_324.wav	2.95	Celtic were the losers then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_325.wav	3.20	Their conclusions were never published.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_326.wav	3.85	Confidence among the allies began to slip.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_327.wav	2.95	Little is known about them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_328.wav	3.38	Margins are also in retreat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_329.wav	2.82	Golf is not like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_330.wav	5.12	It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_331.wav	4.23	The move follows a review of the Singapore
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_332.wav	2.86	Which isn't a bad idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_333.wav	4.99	Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_334.wav	4.18	They will always be in our hearts and in our minds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_335.wav	2.95	He was admitted to hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_336.wav	3.76	Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_337.wav	3.63	Abbey National is an option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_338.wav	4.05	We've had him with us for the past six weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_339.wav	3.16	Harry Potter has lost his magic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_340.wav	4.01	Today we must not repeat that mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_341.wav	3.80	Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_342.wav	4.31	He is the son of former chairman, Lord Wolfson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_343.wav	6.14	Scottish consumer protection groups were generally receptive to the proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_344.wav	4.23	This is a sensible and common sense approach.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_345.wav	3.72	My daughter is an adult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_346.wav	2.99	His third goal was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_347.wav	3.54	I'm very relieved that I have finally won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_349.wav	3.41	My father died in childbirth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_350.wav	3.80	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_351.wav	2.69	So, did she meet him ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_352.wav	3.16	So what is the campaign about ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_353.wav	4.05	This measure is not adjusted for seasonal factors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_354.wav	3.33	They're going to open in early summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_355.wav	3.42	Anyway, the job will be part-time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_356.wav	4.65	I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_357.wav	3.50	And the World Cup has not even begun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_358.wav	3.93	He remains a main board director of Royal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_359.wav	3.20	People should make their own decisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_360.wav	2.65	I saw them last week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_361.wav	3.67	It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_362.wav	2.48	It was a good workout.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_363.wav	4.23	A small number of new jobs will also be created.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_364.wav	3.67	William Hague delighted his party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_365.wav	4.01	His background is firmly in venture capital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_366.wav	2.48	We played them off the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_368.wav	3.25	We can have no complaints.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_369.wav	3.42	The statement contained no surprises.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_370.wav	3.80	Not that Barber has been unhappy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_371.wav	3.67	We will likely look for new investors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_372.wav	2.99	But the rally was short-lived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_373.wav	3.33	But you never won any games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_374.wav	3.16	It didn't matter who was in their way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_375.wav	2.60	And he goes with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_376.wav	3.42	I have little time for analysts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_377.wav	3.42	The most important thing in theatre is to listen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_378.wav	2.86	It was really quite amazing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_379.wav	3.88	It represents a complete change in emphasis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_380.wav	3.76	It is the voice of the survivors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_381.wav	2.86	It was cynical and callous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_382.wav	2.52	He did not say that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_383.wav	2.91	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_384.wav	2.48	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_385.wav	1.80	What do we do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_386.wav	2.56	Why do it otherwise ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_387.wav	3.33	Pensions are a long-term investment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_388.wav	3.76	His successor was only appointed last month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_389.wav	3.59	I've had three shots and got nowhere near.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_390.wav	3.33	It's difficult to put a date on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_391.wav	4.44	The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_392.wav	3.84	Those overseas offices were great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_393.wav	2.90	You will have seen the adverts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_394.wav	3.50	He was dead on arrival at hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_395.wav	4.52	The problems are a result of that shortfall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_396.wav	4.31	Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_397.wav	4.48	Six games without defeat is the legacy so far.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_398.wav	4.87	Standard Life has also highlighted ambitions in this market.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_399.wav	4.01	Colin is free to speak with other teams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_400.wav	3.88	Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_401.wav	4.78	He left the hospital without receiving any medication.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_402.wav	3.33	Venus rejects the very suggestion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_403.wav	3.33	That remains the unanswered question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_404.wav	3.25	Everything has its place and purpose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_405.wav	6.40	Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_406.wav	4.40	He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_407.wav	3.03	And it had two seats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_408.wav	3.20	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_409.wav	2.56	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_410.wav	2.39	But nothing could be done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_411.wav	2.90	This is a historic occasion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_412.wav	5.03	Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_413.wav	4.02	We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_414.wav	3.63	Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_415.wav	4.14	Motherwell have no such good fortune.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_416.wav	4.53	However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_417.wav	6.02	This would discourage investment and job creation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_418.wav	3.67	We have no information on Iraq.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_419.wav	3.80	Either way, the investor retains the premium.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_420.wav	3.67	They prefer the short, intensive session.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_421.wav	3.67	Washington is consumed by the crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_422.wav	2.99	The company declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_423.wav	3.93	It also makes a habit of collecting people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_424.wav	2.90	Got to get my sunglasses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_425.wav	4.61	We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_426.wav	3.19	Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_427.wav	4.91	It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_428.wav	3.97	Messages have to be reinforced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_429.wav	3.21	Not many people like to do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_430.wav	2.86	We accept the new rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_431.wav	2.90	We go there with confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_432.wav	2.48	It was like the old days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_433.wav	3.89	They are interior designers and architects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_434.wav	4.40	They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_435.wav	4.53	I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_436.wav	3.80	The only problem was, they were on himself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_437.wav	2.86	We are aiming for early March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_438.wav	2.99	We discovered that for ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_439.wav	2.65	It is also very valuable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_440.wav	4.10	Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_441.wav	3.08	None of this work is guaranteed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_442.wav	4.27	Now we see no mention of rising rates.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_443.wav	3.72	Still, some additions are inspired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_444.wav	3.29	I believe we can handle this okay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_445.wav	5.46	The whole experience was uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_446.wav	3.67	Hard cash is needed now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_447.wav	3.29	I stayed away from the defence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_448.wav	3.89	Our performance continues to be outstanding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_449.wav	5.64	Celtic are simply trying to buy time by not paying the money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_450.wav	3.29	Either way, it's very funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_451.wav	2.95	It has become a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_452.wav	2.56	We didn't want any trouble.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_453.wav	3.25	It seemed a logical expansion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_454.wav	4.53	Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_455.wav	4.06	Stagecoach is seeking a new finance director.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_456.wav	3.08	Now it has doubled in size.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_458.wav	3.37	I have worked as a stand-up there often.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_459.wav	3.80	They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p238\p238_460.wav	2.78	It is business as usual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_001.wav	2.27	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_002.wav	3.42	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_003.wav	6.74	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_004.wav	5.00	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_005.wav	5.55	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_006.wav	4.91	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_007.wav	6.87	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_008.wav	7.38	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_009.wav	4.10	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_010.wav	2.86	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_011.wav	5.98	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_012.wav	4.70	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_013.wav	4.10	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_014.wav	4.31	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_015.wav	5.08	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_016.wav	6.23	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_017.wav	4.61	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_018.wav	4.87	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_019.wav	6.40	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_020.wav	4.10	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_021.wav	7.98	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_022.wav	5.98	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_023.wav	9.43	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_024.wav	6.23	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_025.wav	2.60	They might have asked, for goodness sake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_026.wav	3.93	The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_027.wav	2.56	And so was a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_028.wav	3.46	We are not aware of any British casualties at this stage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_029.wav	2.90	There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_030.wav	2.69	It is about control of our economy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_031.wav	2.48	There was a rush of water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_032.wav	2.48	That's all I was trying to do today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_033.wav	2.86	Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_034.wav	3.03	Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_035.wav	2.56	I might well have done so already.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_036.wav	2.82	That can cost him a fortune.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_037.wav	2.82	He works at the airport.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_038.wav	2.48	How do you take them away ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_039.wav	2.99	However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_040.wav	2.48	After the match, do you ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_041.wav	2.22	Has the conflict started ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_042.wav	2.43	Have I really come to this ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_043.wav	3.67	This matter has still to come before the European Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_044.wav	2.31	It carried a double message.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_045.wav	3.80	Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_046.wav	3.12	But not a penny has been paid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_047.wav	3.80	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_048.wav	4.23	Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_049.wav	2.56	We must learn to finish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_050.wav	2.86	You must always attempt to raise the bar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_051.wav	1.92	New York is my home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_052.wav	4.01	The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_053.wav	2.65	I remember that day well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_054.wav	2.82	Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_055.wav	2.78	He is too weak to move.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_056.wav	3.16	Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_057.wav	3.38	I feel we might now have the foundations to go forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_058.wav	2.69	Among them are many criminals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_059.wav	2.73	That's been the difference between the sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_060.wav	2.69	And they removed a Borderer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_061.wav	3.16	All manner of precaution and protection are taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_062.wav	2.56	Perhaps we should do the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_063.wav	3.97	Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_064.wav	2.52	They were on holiday in Egypt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_065.wav	2.90	They desperately want some stability.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_066.wav	2.09	Everything is possible in football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_067.wav	2.91	Everyone could see the joke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_068.wav	2.44	I'm pleased with the horse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_069.wav	3.03	He will need that machine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_070.wav	3.71	The new clubhouse was packed with people watching the game on TV.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_071.wav	2.99	Then they scored two goals to win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_072.wav	2.52	In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_073.wav	2.99	Pulled a huge number of viewers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_074.wav	3.50	The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_075.wav	2.91	Let's not be too despondent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_076.wav	2.86	The Government does not go far enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_077.wav	2.82	He phoned the number in the brochure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_078.wav	3.16	I haven't got there yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_079.wav	3.24	I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_080.wav	2.99	They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_081.wav	3.38	In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_082.wav	3.97	Labour has replaced the Tories as the party of the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_083.wav	1.80	But the organisers refused to worry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_084.wav	2.78	And it had two seats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_085.wav	2.65	Indeed, it is only the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_086.wav	2.35	Or so the theory goes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_087.wav	2.22	He has really done well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_088.wav	2.05	So what happens next ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_089.wav	1.54	Had this been common practice ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_090.wav	2.48	What do they want us to do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_091.wav	2.14	Is it worth it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_092.wav	1.84	Does it matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_093.wav	4.65	George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_094.wav	2.86	But I had never been in a theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_095.wav	2.31	It was fun, but not a living.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_096.wav	3.25	Kenny Miller might come through.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_097.wav	4.14	Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_098.wav	4.02	The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_099.wav	2.56	We will pay their bills.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_100.wav	3.63	Sales are falling after years of growth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_101.wav	2.56	It was exactly four months away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_102.wav	4.01	But they also noted a partial strengthening of survey evidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_103.wav	4.95	We have a major concern about enforcement action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_104.wav	2.01	I am so proud of him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_105.wav	2.61	This time, it might be for real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_106.wav	2.35	He will be kept informed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_107.wav	2.56	There could be a way back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_108.wav	2.14	He was a lovely man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_109.wav	2.14	People will have to be patient.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_110.wav	2.39	I can't remember a lot of it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_111.wav	2.78	Instead, another depression came in.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_112.wav	2.99	Talk of a crisis is absurd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_113.wav	2.73	We have thought about doing lots of things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_114.wav	2.05	It is sometimes like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_115.wav	2.14	The partners are looking for answers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_116.wav	2.05	I've had it for the exams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_117.wav	2.65	Those people must be accountable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_118.wav	3.80	We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_119.wav	2.65	The Festival is prepared to help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_120.wav	3.63	Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_121.wav	2.31	The error appeared in a warrant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_122.wav	3.54	They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_123.wav	3.24	Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_124.wav	2.60	He was just a journalist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_125.wav	2.56	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_126.wav	3.12	Their season has been consigned to history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_127.wav	2.61	Diversions were put in place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_128.wav	2.95	How independent is that ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_129.wav	2.14	What form did that take ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_130.wav	1.75	Are they free ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_131.wav	2.14	What are they for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_132.wav	2.26	Is there a waiting list ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_133.wav	2.86	Do they think anyone else wants them ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_134.wav	3.76	Maybe he has been away from British football for too long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_135.wav	2.90	Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_136.wav	4.35	Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_137.wav	2.82	Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_138.wav	3.67	The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_139.wav	3.37	It is the only practical access for vehicles and men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_140.wav	2.65	So it was at Easter Road.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_141.wav	3.38	A move to Manchester United would be tremendous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_142.wav	2.91	Absences should be carefully monitored.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_143.wav	3.29	He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_144.wav	4.02	The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_145.wav	1.75	We just have to adapt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_146.wav	2.18	He was forced to quit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_147.wav	3.16	Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_148.wav	3.16	People have been placed in a state of alarm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_149.wav	2.82	I was given no instructions by no-one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_150.wav	3.29	The move follows a review of the Singapore
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_151.wav	1.97	Which isn't a bad idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_152.wav	2.61	Since then, things have improved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_153.wav	2.22	That's what happened against Ayr.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_154.wav	2.86	Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_155.wav	3.16	He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_156.wav	2.48	It is a good lifestyle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_157.wav	2.52	Before the game we went for a pint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_158.wav	2.39	Our relationship has been very good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_159.wav	2.22	It was the climax of the thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_160.wav	2.95	Nato has left them with no other option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_161.wav	3.54	Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_162.wav	2.44	I think the referee was good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_163.wav	2.73	I understand the medical concerns.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_164.wav	3.20	Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_165.wav	2.30	This was a unique election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_166.wav	2.48	They exist in name alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_167.wav	3.12	We have reacted well to each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_168.wav	1.96	I can see it now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_169.wav	2.90	Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_170.wav	2.39	There's still plenty time left.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_171.wav	3.03	Those three weeks are totally lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_172.wav	4.27	This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_173.wav	2.09	She is in good spirits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_174.wav	2.39	As if that is an achievement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_175.wav	2.60	Mr Blair should be warned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_176.wav	4.36	Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_177.wav	2.52	There was a fossil on screen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_178.wav	2.52	Is it in the right place ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_179.wav	1.97	Did he trip ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_180.wav	2.48	Does that put pressure on us ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_181.wav	1.79	Did it work ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_182.wav	2.65	Do you think we are a top nation ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_183.wav	2.52	Here, again, they were denied a voice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_184.wav	2.69	Structural changes were also required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_185.wav	2.14	His job was not advertised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_186.wav	2.48	That was just one night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_187.wav	2.69	This is a frightening development.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_188.wav	2.52	They keep the atmosphere in mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_189.wav	3.07	Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_190.wav	2.52	Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_191.wav	3.25	That is an entirely unacceptable position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_192.wav	2.52	My father died in childbirth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_193.wav	2.99	In addition, margins have been maintained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_194.wav	3.63	Such an appointment could go some way to reassure investors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_195.wav	2.86	The Yugoslav army will still be there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_196.wav	3.29	Two years of building a business will go up in smoke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_197.wav	2.56	You've got to be vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_198.wav	2.90	He said the director had been completely friendly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_199.wav	2.43	Tiger is not the norm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_200.wav	2.69	It's been a humbling year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_201.wav	2.91	Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_202.wav	4.01	Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_203.wav	3.07	It is all to do with the coaching.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_204.wav	2.69	There was a fine line to tread.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_205.wav	2.61	The refund is fully justified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_206.wav	2.78	My wife and family are the support system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_207.wav	3.71	We are now working with full-time on future product.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_208.wav	3.12	He has many offers from the English Premiership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_209.wav	2.44	He is a very talented player.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_210.wav	2.73	Bottling is now the core business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_211.wav	2.65	I would be surprised if he decided to give up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_212.wav	2.39	The protest will go ahead as planned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_213.wav	2.91	People have been wonderful beyond belief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_214.wav	3.08	The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_215.wav	3.67	That group reported just before Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_216.wav	3.24	We had to add value.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_217.wav	3.67	Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_218.wav	3.59	IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_219.wav	2.31	So I got a blood test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_220.wav	2.91	Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_221.wav	2.14	I was caught out a little bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_222.wav	2.56	There's always the next century.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_223.wav	3.24	The business has expanded rapidly, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_224.wav	2.69	But it's an enjoyable job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_225.wav	3.37	Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_226.wav	2.90	There's only one team in Ayrshire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_227.wav	3.46	Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_228.wav	3.12	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_229.wav	3.29	Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_230.wav	2.65	She had gone to the Catholic school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_231.wav	2.99	Then we will face the Danish champions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_232.wav	2.09	It would seem a natural progression.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_233.wav	3.46	Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_234.wav	2.09	We will turn the corner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_235.wav	2.65	Of course, it is a tough assignment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_236.wav	2.56	My Dad is a hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_237.wav	2.35	Jackie is passionate about Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_238.wav	3.42	Further details are expected later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_239.wav	3.25	This is absolutely not true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_240.wav	2.48	They should stop the bombing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_241.wav	2.57	These days are long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_242.wav	2.52	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_243.wav	2.99	was everything done to save people ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_244.wav	3.67	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_245.wav	2.90	Do I think about them often ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_246.wav	4.10	Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_247.wav	2.39	I've learned from my mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_248.wav	2.82	Adams is surely worth a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_249.wav	4.06	This season has been a mixture of frustration and fulfilment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_250.wav	2.90	I've come here for the jersey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_251.wav	4.27	The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_252.wav	3.80	The strong performance is expected to continue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_253.wav	4.31	The challenge for the industry is to capture and retain that talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_254.wav	2.90	She replied, It could be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_255.wav	3.41	Allen is strong in every shape and form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_256.wav	3.76	Her political persuasion is no secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_257.wav	2.95	We have a budget in March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_258.wav	2.90	ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_259.wav	2.48	We have expanded too quickly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_260.wav	3.37	I'd been out with my girlfriend and we were attacked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_261.wav	2.95	Boats and other equipment would be pooled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_262.wav	3.50	Stewart Ivory also declined to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_263.wav	2.47	Our position remains the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_264.wav	3.12	The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_265.wav	2.22	They could not match it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_266.wav	2.82	He is not a pathetic figure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_267.wav	4.31	The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_268.wav	2.90	They made such decisions in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_269.wav	3.41	This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_270.wav	2.73	Harrowing is easy, after all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_271.wav	2.39	Each case is treated on merit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_272.wav	2.48	A winter of discontent awaits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_273.wav	2.39	I thought we were fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_274.wav	3.03	They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_275.wav	3.07	It's going to be very closely watched.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_276.wav	4.57	It is fairly specialised and mainly for the export of breeding animals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_277.wav	3.37	They receive a high profile in the media.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_278.wav	2.91	Our destiny is in our own hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_279.wav	2.86	Miller was every bit as happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_280.wav	4.87	Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_281.wav	5.08	Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_282.wav	2.91	There is no internal damage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_283.wav	2.39	We've had great things in the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_284.wav	3.20	It could be done by experts and lawyers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_285.wav	2.95	It has been recorded twice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_286.wav	2.69	Aberdeen had little to offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_287.wav	3.29	However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_288.wav	2.82	It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_289.wav	3.41	This youngster is so exciting!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_290.wav	2.52	It was a pre-emptive strike.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_291.wav	3.63	Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_292.wav	2.39	They will probably come back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_293.wav	3.24	This is a good incentive for both parties to conclude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_294.wav	2.14	I saw them last week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_295.wav	2.31	Friday night was a pretty good night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_296.wav	3.37	This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_297.wav	3.42	You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_298.wav	3.12	We may need to take some very radical measures.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_299.wav	2.65	Everyone can have their opinion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_300.wav	2.95	The best thing for me was to join the Army.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_301.wav	3.41	Celtic are delaying the question of a new contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_302.wav	3.50	Mr McLeod said he believed a solution would be reached.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_303.wav	3.80	The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_304.wav	2.44	That should give me a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_305.wav	2.26	They have played their part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_306.wav	2.95	This will be our new beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_307.wav	2.73	They have the cash and the fire power.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_308.wav	3.84	Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_309.wav	3.33	The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_310.wav	3.16	Racism has no place in any sport.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_311.wav	2.14	Celtic were the losers then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_312.wav	3.03	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_313.wav	2.52	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_314.wav	2.91	how do you get it back ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_315.wav	2.35	What are you not good at ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_316.wav	2.69	I think, therefore I am ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_317.wav	1.88	Who was she ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_318.wav	2.61	The result is utterly compelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_319.wav	3.63	The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_320.wav	2.61	I have been very nervous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_321.wav	3.25	Confidence among the allies began to slip.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_322.wav	3.24	There were also some interesting questions and answers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_323.wav	2.65	I won't make an official complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_324.wav	4.31	It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_325.wav	2.35	It wasn't about her singing, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_326.wav	2.39	They are looking at a flotation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_327.wav	2.90	They make a selective perception process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_328.wav	3.93	Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_329.wav	2.56	He was admitted to hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_330.wav	2.65	Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_331.wav	3.67	It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_332.wav	2.73	January is a bad time of year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_333.wav	2.91	And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_334.wav	2.48	Royal Bank declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_335.wav	2.56	From there, they can go anywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_336.wav	2.48	Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_337.wav	2.86	Twaddle is a case in point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_338.wav	3.46	We used to live with dignity in our country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_339.wav	2.26	My daughter is an adult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_340.wav	2.90	It will affect their work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_341.wav	3.97	Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_342.wav	2.86	I am considered a teenager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_343.wav	2.95	Anyway, the job will be part-time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_344.wav	2.95	The FBI could become involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_345.wav	3.33	Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_346.wav	2.73	I just felt that I was broken down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_347.wav	2.69	And the World Cup has not even begun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_348.wav	3.12	It comes from reflection or thinking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_349.wav	3.33	This is the version which appeared in our paper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_350.wav	2.82	Translation - we got it wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_351.wav	3.03	It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_352.wav	3.37	They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_353.wav	2.56	What happened in that game ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_354.wav	2.52	Are you going to win ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_355.wav	2.77	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_356.wav	2.56	So, did she meet him ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_357.wav	3.46	So what is the campaign about ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_358.wav	4.06	The wedding date has been set for Orlando in Florida in October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_359.wav	2.65	William Hague delighted his party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_360.wav	3.55	That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_361.wav	2.69	We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_362.wav	2.65	Walker plans to return indoors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_363.wav	3.42	The actual increases will be announced next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_364.wav	2.82	The statement contained no surprises.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_365.wav	2.22	The scientific debate is dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_366.wav	3.03	This would include the GM food industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_367.wav	3.16	But the rally was short-lived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_368.wav	3.41	Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_369.wav	2.52	They are the innocent victims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_370.wav	2.99	It didn't matter who was in their way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_371.wav	2.78	He ended up a headmaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_372.wav	2.48	That took about two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_373.wav	2.60	He is obviously very dangerous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_374.wav	2.78	That remains the unanswered question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_375.wav	2.90	This should come as no surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_376.wav	2.91	It was launched in February last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_377.wav	2.91	Commitment is released on Liberty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_378.wav	2.48	I love the spectacle of cinema.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_379.wav	2.22	He did not say that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_380.wav	2.61	Pensions are a long-term investment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_381.wav	2.39	We have not been approached.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_382.wav	2.44	Murray Johnstone will replace it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_383.wav	3.54	North African countries are also seen as potential customers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_384.wav	3.50	The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_385.wav	3.07	Those overseas offices were great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_386.wav	2.31	Well, that's just a third district.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_387.wav	2.60	She asked for the appointment with me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_388.wav	3.20	Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_389.wav	2.39	A new school will be built.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_390.wav	2.57	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_391.wav	2.26	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_392.wav	2.31	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_393.wav	2.31	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_394.wav	2.86	His leader wanted to celebrate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_395.wav	2.65	Venus rejects the very suggestion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_396.wav	3.93	This fact is supported by audience research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_397.wav	3.16	Because of that I didn't enjoy the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_398.wav	2.69	We were beaten by the better team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_399.wav	2.35	Both sides have to step back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_400.wav	3.20	Analysts were impressed with progress made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_401.wav	2.91	Everything has its place and purpose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_402.wav	3.03	I have received no explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_403.wav	2.78	Turnover was highest in telecoms.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_404.wav	4.61	Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_405.wav	2.74	He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_406.wav	3.93	This game is very evenly balanced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_407.wav	4.78	Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_408.wav	2.86	It seems a waste of talents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_409.wav	3.50	Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_410.wav	2.99	We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_411.wav	2.65	You can feel at home in China.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_412.wav	3.63	This would discourage investment and job creation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_413.wav	2.73	We have no information on Iraq.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_414.wav	2.65	It depends on Labour, not on us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_415.wav	2.86	Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_416.wav	2.99	You're not getting any goodwill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_417.wav	2.69	The baby deserves the credit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_418.wav	2.99	Washington is consumed by the crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_419.wav	3.20	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_420.wav	2.43	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_421.wav	3.25	It makes no difference to their friendship.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_422.wav	3.21	It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_423.wav	3.93	It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_424.wav	2.99	The capital costs are modest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_425.wav	3.59	Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_426.wav	2.30	It certainly feels that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_427.wav	3.29	This idea has been around for four years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_428.wav	3.25	Or maybe it's the other way around.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_429.wav	3.46	We are facing a health disaster if we do not act.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_430.wav	2.65	We accept the new rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_431.wav	3.07	Blair is very positive at European Councils.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_432.wav	3.25	They are interior designers and architects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_433.wav	2.82	He was released after treatment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_434.wav	3.12	All the pieces fit together perfectly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_435.wav	3.33	Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_436.wav	3.54	I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_437.wav	3.29	Things are going to change over the next six months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_438.wav	2.60	Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_439.wav	3.80	The potential for Scottish beef is not limited to carcasses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_440.wav	2.39	It is also very valuable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_441.wav	2.73	The stage was set for a showdown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_442.wav	3.54	This could put pressure on UK inflation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_443.wav	3.37	They should not feel under threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_444.wav	2.95	Any error is severely punished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_445.wav	3.42	Either group is living in fantasy land.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_446.wav	3.16	That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_447.wav	2.31	Hard cash is needed now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_448.wav	3.71	Her housekeeper discovered the break-in on Thursday morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_449.wav	2.90	Blair also had a penalty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_450.wav	2.73	Frankly, we should all have such problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_451.wav	2.09	Either way, it's very funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_452.wav	2.77	We didn't want any trouble.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_453.wav	2.43	It seemed a logical expansion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_454.wav	3.58	Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_455.wav	2.44	And Michael was just great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_456.wav	2.35	Now it has doubled in size.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_457.wav	2.26	It was never a free kick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_458.wav	2.69	They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_459.wav	2.86	This is a great opportunity for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_460.wav	4.57	Further savings would arise from common procurement and IT systems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_461.wav	3.33	Inventories are coming under control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_462.wav	3.12	She failed in her action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_463.wav	3.46	We will provide immediate access.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_464.wav	3.76	We also acknowledge the grief and pain of their relatives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_465.wav	3.55	Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_466.wav	3.03	Several hundred people attended yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_467.wav	3.84	Dunfermline manager Jimmy Calderwood was candid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_468.wav	3.54	The money is within the total allocation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_469.wav	2.95	The partnership was set up during the summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_470.wav	2.99	This does not create any precedent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_471.wav	2.31	There's nothing I can say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_472.wav	2.52	We need a visionary producer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_473.wav	3.41	The response from everyone was wonderful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_474.wav	4.27	There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_475.wav	2.69	I am sorry, but I forgot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_476.wav	3.24	Banking stocks were hit hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_477.wav	2.61	We did something about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_478.wav	3.03	The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_479.wav	3.63	Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_480.wav	3.29	Five years later, the deception continued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_481.wav	2.99	The rescue package is public money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_482.wav	2.90	The death toll included five children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_483.wav	3.71	Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_484.wav	2.78	Sales have been perfectly buoyant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_485.wav	2.65	I was there five months ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_486.wav	3.16	It happened again, and again, and again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_487.wav	2.65	It could well be military.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_488.wav	2.94	Holland won by five wickets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_489.wav	4.83	Other casualties were averted by the swift response of the emergency services.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_490.wav	4.01	They cannot operate without a licence from the local authority.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_491.wav	2.90	It's unlikely to be renewed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_492.wav	2.99	MOVIE stars are public property.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_493.wav	2.86	I first met him last summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_494.wav	2.39	The songs are just so good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_495.wav	2.95	The whole thing was just unreal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_496.wav	2.73	I can hardly believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_497.wav	2.65	They haven't been thought through.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_498.wav	3.12	Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_499.wav	2.82	I am not unduly surprised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_500.wav	2.90	Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_501.wav	2.95	You are a different people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_502.wav	3.12	McPherson came from United Biscuits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p239\p239_503.wav	2.73	The world record is suspicious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_001.wav	2.95	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_002.wav	3.97	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_003.wav	7.60	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_004.wav	5.42	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_005.wav	6.49	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_006.wav	5.55	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_007.wav	4.78	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_008.wav	7.04	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_009.wav	4.82	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_010.wav	3.16	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_011.wav	6.74	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_012.wav	4.78	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_013.wav	4.78	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_014.wav	4.82	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_015.wav	6.06	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_016.wav	6.36	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_017.wav	3.76	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_018.wav	5.63	Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_019.wav	7.13	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_020.wav	4.40	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_021.wav	8.88	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_022.wav	6.78	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_023.wav	10.28	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_024.wav	6.91	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_025.wav	2.35	Johnson was pretty low.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_026.wav	1.79	But it failed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_027.wav	4.69	Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_028.wav	1.71	Is this accurate?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_029.wav	3.88	I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_030.wav	5.00	They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_031.wav	4.02	We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_032.wav	4.69	They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_033.wav	2.61	This is the window.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_034.wav	2.77	People love to see this stuff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_035.wav	2.73	He took me on a tour of the wards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_036.wav	1.92	It is marvellous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_037.wav	4.10	Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_038.wav	1.92	It has failed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_039.wav	1.88	They're just different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_040.wav	1.84	It's a real threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_041.wav	2.01	It was the eighties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_042.wav	2.05	Indeed, he does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_043.wav	2.65	President Bush is at war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_044.wav	3.93	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_045.wav	3.46	On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_046.wav	3.42	You must always attempt to raise the bar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_047.wav	1.88	It is so sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_048.wav	2.39	That period was a struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_049.wav	2.82	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_050.wav	1.75	Who can say?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_051.wav	1.88	It's a blessing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_052.wav	5.08	The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_053.wav	2.99	Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_054.wav	2.86	He is too weak to move.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_055.wav	4.40	Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_056.wav	2.52	He had no enemies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_057.wav	4.48	I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_058.wav	3.29	However the drama was still not at an end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_059.wav	3.67	For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_060.wav	1.66	That's the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_061.wav	4.27	The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_062.wav	2.78	I've had six days of rehearsal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_063.wav	3.12	He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_064.wav	2.43	Art is extra.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_065.wav	2.56	Scotland had great assets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_066.wav	2.60	They are real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_067.wav	4.61	There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_068.wav	4.36	I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_069.wav	3.03	It should be devolved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_070.wav	3.97	We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_071.wav	4.18	It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_072.wav	3.29	I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_073.wav	2.99	I was as strong as a horse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_074.wav	3.16	They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_075.wav	2.77	The girls are so lucky to be alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_076.wav	2.99	She died in hospital two hours later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_077.wav	2.52	Is there a new way forward?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_078.wav	2.01	I've got the shirt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_079.wav	2.86	Today she has been released.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_080.wav	3.24	The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_081.wav	3.37	Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_082.wav	1.66	What has changed?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_083.wav	2.18	He is in the queue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_084.wav	3.93	He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_085.wav	2.86	Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_086.wav	2.44	Someone who cares
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_087.wav	3.33	Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_088.wav	3.29	Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_089.wav	2.74	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_090.wav	2.77	That will come after the game on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_091.wav	2.26	Today I couldn't run on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_092.wav	2.05	She told The Herald.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_093.wav	2.48	We could not get any possession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_094.wav	3.24	He is hungry for success and I am the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_095.wav	3.08	It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_096.wav	2.52	They were outside the circle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_097.wav	3.76	He said he hoped for a first meeting within a few days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_098.wav	2.60	It was a good performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_099.wav	2.60	I see no need for change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_100.wav	2.73	We have every respect for Michelle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_101.wav	3.50	But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_102.wav	1.96	He takes the job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_103.wav	2.65	They will want to perform well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_104.wav	2.35	That all hope is never lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_105.wav	2.86	It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_106.wav	4.23	Getting new people interested in this music is the real reward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_107.wav	2.18	It's in his blood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_108.wav	1.62	It's a shame.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_109.wav	2.60	It had been played at festivals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_110.wav	2.14	I came to complete.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_111.wav	2.48	It's a question of perception.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_112.wav	3.42	In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_113.wav	2.73	This film will be totally awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_114.wav	4.95	Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_115.wav	2.22	I'm delighted about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_116.wav	3.67	Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_117.wav	1.75	I joined a group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_118.wav	4.36	This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_119.wav	2.52	She really suffered for her art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_120.wav	2.73	It is a delight on every level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_121.wav	2.39	You can spend money on housing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_122.wav	2.74	There were no grounds for his action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_123.wav	4.91	It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_124.wav	3.80	Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_125.wav	2.09	I was furious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_126.wav	4.14	His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_127.wav	3.63	It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_128.wav	4.44	Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_129.wav	3.63	I do not think this family will ever get over this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_130.wav	3.76	Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_131.wav	3.29	Offered the gold medal, he declined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_132.wav	2.35	It was the same at Twickenham.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_133.wav	4.53	The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_134.wav	2.74	It is also well received.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_135.wav	2.52	Government will intervene.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_136.wav	3.08	Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_137.wav	2.48	He was in a great deal of pain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_138.wav	2.22	We want to keep the pound.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_139.wav	3.37	It seems so long since I did the exams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_140.wav	4.35	And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_141.wav	3.16	Wallace was a prisoner of war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_142.wav	2.31	Who would be right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_143.wav	2.39	She died at her home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_144.wav	2.74	I am just trying to do my job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_145.wav	3.29	It opens the door to the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_146.wav	3.80	It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_147.wav	2.52	They did very well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_148.wav	3.54	Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_149.wav	3.08	It was deployed in the Gulf War.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_150.wav	4.14	It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_151.wav	5.04	Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_152.wav	4.14	Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_153.wav	2.31	Mr Blair had done well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_154.wav	2.52	I was in daily contact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_155.wav	2.27	My Dad is a hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_156.wav	4.91	The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_157.wav	3.50	Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_158.wav	2.60	Was this element always there?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_159.wav	2.39	These days are long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_160.wav	4.48	Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_161.wav	3.37	It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_162.wav	2.82	I was in the train station overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_163.wav	3.24	We knew we had the goal we wanted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_164.wav	4.74	However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_165.wav	2.26	Tell it like it was?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_166.wav	2.90	We have a budget in March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_167.wav	2.90	That must be left to the Parole Board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_168.wav	4.10	By then, however, both men were already in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_169.wav	2.60	They will do their own thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_170.wav	3.50	And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_171.wav	2.39	It's quite a routine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_172.wav	4.52	The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_173.wav	2.95	The hotel was now for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_174.wav	2.73	I drove the ball well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_175.wav	4.99	Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_176.wav	3.67	They know no other way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_177.wav	3.37	There is no point in looking any further.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_178.wav	4.74	And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_179.wav	4.27	Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_180.wav	2.44	They will run a mile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_181.wav	4.10	Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_182.wav	2.43	They need to look after themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_183.wav	2.65	Miller was every bit as happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_184.wav	3.50	What has caused the demise of singing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_185.wav	3.12	We want to help them through it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_186.wav	2.90	They really did a great job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_187.wav	3.12	It was an odd affair, in many respects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_188.wav	2.82	It is tough, but possible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_189.wav	3.76	It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_190.wav	5.46	Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_191.wav	3.80	The procedure is the same in all cases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_192.wav	2.86	People will ask about us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_193.wav	4.48	But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_194.wav	2.82	It is a farce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_195.wav	2.52	I am totally surprised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_196.wav	4.48	The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_197.wav	2.61	It wasn't to be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_198.wav	2.78	There was no option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_199.wav	4.27	There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_200.wav	3.03	But we are not immune to the problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_201.wav	2.65	If it doesn't, it doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_202.wav	2.22	Who will pay for this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_203.wav	3.55	They've got three-quarters of the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_204.wav	4.27	The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_205.wav	4.18	I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_206.wav	3.12	It's all about money, money, money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_207.wav	4.40	We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_208.wav	2.90	It's a mixture of everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_209.wav	3.29	We have an election in eight days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_210.wav	4.83	The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_211.wav	3.08	We'll have to work hard today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_212.wav	2.13	She should not be blamed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_213.wav	4.87	We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_214.wav	2.56	It had all been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_215.wav	3.25	A Grampian Police spokesman said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_216.wav	2.73	His third goal was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_217.wav	2.01	I was so nervous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_218.wav	2.01	Work has started.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_219.wav	4.44	For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_220.wav	4.65	He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_221.wav	3.59	The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_222.wav	3.67	It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_223.wav	2.90	That has been the easy part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_224.wav	3.59	Women were mostly notable by their absence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_225.wav	3.07	But it will be sorted out this week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_226.wav	2.26	What was the main difference?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_227.wav	2.56	I am immensely sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_228.wav	2.01	It is a gamble.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_229.wav	2.99	At the time, he was a living legend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_230.wav	2.05	It's so special.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_231.wav	2.65	They are the innocent victims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_232.wav	4.31	Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_233.wav	2.99	The body follows the mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_234.wav	4.23	However, no further action was taken by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_235.wav	2.82	And thought we would get away with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_236.wav	1.92	Jobs could go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_237.wav	2.44	It is not the message alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_238.wav	2.05	It's quite a line-up!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_239.wav	2.18	It's very safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_240.wav	2.43	But it's a subtle process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_241.wav	3.50	Of further privacy, he had no need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_242.wav	3.29	He was good, but not that good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_243.wav	3.20	We were extremely poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_244.wav	5.42	Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_245.wav	3.29	In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_246.wav	2.65	It is hard won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_247.wav	5.42	A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_248.wav	3.50	Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_249.wav	3.46	I am the opposite because I haven't played very much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_250.wav	3.67	I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_251.wav	5.42	In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_252.wav	2.44	He got the same story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_253.wav	3.85	It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_254.wav	3.93	I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_255.wav	3.03	A friendship that will endure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_256.wav	3.76	He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_257.wav	2.78	Her presence was almost everywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_258.wav	4.74	For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_259.wav	4.53	That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_260.wav	5.04	Blair is very positive at European Councils.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_261.wav	4.52	One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_262.wav	3.67	So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_263.wav	3.03	I was happily surprised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_264.wav	2.56	They must play for each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_265.wav	2.73	It is also very valuable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_266.wav	4.65	George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_267.wav	2.39	Blood samples were taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_268.wav	2.18	There is no link.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_269.wav	2.65	This is a question of Islam.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_270.wav	2.61	It looks as though he will be right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_271.wav	3.84	Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_272.wav	4.19	Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_273.wav	2.78	Have a look at our accounts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_274.wav	3.46	He was also married with two children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_275.wav	2.91	And Michael was just great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_276.wav	3.72	Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_277.wav	2.65	Access has been a nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_278.wav	3.76	It has been achieved by hard work and careful planning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_279.wav	1.97	It's a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_280.wav	4.91	The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_281.wav	3.80	A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_282.wav	3.67	However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_283.wav	1.97	People have no choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_284.wav	3.33	In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_285.wav	3.29	In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_286.wav	2.48	If not, he should go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_288.wav	3.46	His mother refuses to believe that she is dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_289.wav	3.97	Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_290.wav	4.06	This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_291.wav	3.16	Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_292.wav	3.59	He will address the nation this evening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_293.wav	2.18	It was a virus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_294.wav	2.69	Maloney is an engaging talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_295.wav	4.48	The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_296.wav	2.73	It's like a high school play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_297.wav	1.92	Who did the recruiting?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_298.wav	2.73	He was obviously very genuine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_299.wav	3.54	She said she could not believe that they had run away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_300.wav	3.12	Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_301.wav	2.31	A new school will be built.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_302.wav	2.65	We have to sort it out ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_303.wav	2.35	He said she was mad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_304.wav	2.05	I was the sheep.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_305.wav	2.48	There was no hint of scandal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_306.wav	3.50	The home was now under new management.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_307.wav	3.50	The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_308.wav	2.82	We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_309.wav	4.65	In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_310.wav	2.95	We do not expect any surplus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_311.wav	4.57	The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_312.wav	1.97	The plot is minimal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_313.wav	2.05	And he goes with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_314.wav	2.56	SCOTLAND has shown the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_315.wav	2.10	It is no surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_316.wav	3.97	Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_317.wav	3.37	The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_318.wav	4.31	They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_319.wav	2.77	They were fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_320.wav	3.41	There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_321.wav	2.13	We are a peaceful people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_322.wav	3.37	The election is total confusion and chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_323.wav	2.35	Henman has been warned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_324.wav	3.12	Craig is a major concern for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_325.wav	5.34	It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_326.wav	2.31	It is out there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_327.wav	2.56	Referees are easy targets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_328.wav	1.84	They had a confession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_329.wav	1.67	We do the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_330.wav	2.44	That's the law of the land.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_331.wav	2.43	Donald was his friend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_332.wav	2.30	I am so upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_333.wav	3.72	They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_334.wav	3.16	Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_335.wav	2.82	The police have to act to help them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_336.wav	2.43	We agreed to disagree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_337.wav	4.31	It could have gone either way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_338.wav	2.43	He was then replaced by Ross.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_339.wav	2.18	I saw some good things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_340.wav	2.43	I've not thought about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_341.wav	2.48	Who was the mystery MP?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_342.wav	4.14	In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_343.wav	2.39	It is a sign of hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_344.wav	3.54	Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_345.wav	2.91	Three years ago he would have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_346.wav	3.71	Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_347.wav	2.01	It is so unfair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_348.wav	4.74	They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_349.wav	2.56	He has to learn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_351.wav	9.35	Look at the witnesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_352.wav	3.80	That is the very reason why it was so vital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_353.wav	3.71	However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_354.wav	1.97	The composer will conduct.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_355.wav	2.39	This is a friendly match?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_357.wav	3.12	They should take their mobile phones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_358.wav	4.18	On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_359.wav	4.14	However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_360.wav	3.63	He had played well in that central role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_361.wav	4.10	He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_362.wav	3.03	That is a break with tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_363.wav	5.08	A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_364.wav	3.46	The council said the house would have to be demolished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_365.wav	4.31	They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_366.wav	3.33	In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_367.wav	2.69	As, indeed, they would be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_368.wav	4.35	But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_369.wav	5.04	Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_370.wav	1.88	Hartley should know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_371.wav	1.75	That would help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_372.wav	2.91	A deadline is still essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_373.wav	4.57	Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_374.wav	3.89	Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_375.wav	2.86	We are looking for perfection.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_376.wav	3.54	On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_377.wav	3.29	He later became a respected High Court judge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_378.wav	1.96	It's been hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_379.wav	2.65	It's now down in black and white.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p240\p240_380.wav	2.65	Safety was also an issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_001.wav	3.71	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_002.wav	4.22	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_003.wav	7.98	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_004.wav	4.91	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_005.wav	6.83	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_006.wav	5.76	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_007.wav	4.27	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_008.wav	7.81	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_009.wav	5.04	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_010.wav	3.80	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_011.wav	7.81	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_012.wav	5.04	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_013.wav	4.70	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_014.wav	5.17	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_016.wav	6.70	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_017.wav	4.19	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_018.wav	5.68	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_019.wav	7.73	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_021.wav	9.09	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_023.wav	10.84	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_024.wav	7.30	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_025.wav	3.29	She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_026.wav	4.02	He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_027.wav	3.46	We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_028.wav	3.38	I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_029.wav	3.84	However, the following year the cancer returned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_030.wav	3.50	Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_031.wav	4.83	They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_032.wav	2.27	This is the window.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_033.wav	2.35	People love to see this stuff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_034.wav	2.14	And we have a singer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_035.wav	2.90	He took me on a tour of the wards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_036.wav	3.29	IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_037.wav	2.10	It's nice to hear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_038.wav	5.03	Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_039.wav	3.16	It is not for any other purpose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_040.wav	2.69	President Bush is at war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_041.wav	2.05	It was ugly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_042.wav	3.07	You must always attempt to raise the bar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_043.wav	2.56	That period was a struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_044.wav	2.99	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_045.wav	1.97	We need to chat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_046.wav	2.48	That time has passed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_047.wav	2.26	As she explains.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_048.wav	2.39	He is too weak to move.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_049.wav	3.55	He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_050.wav	3.29	In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_051.wav	2.35	He looks like an Afghan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_052.wav	3.54	We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_053.wav	4.65	However the drama was still not at an end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_055.wav	2.73	Next league matches Celtic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_056.wav	4.27	Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_057.wav	2.78	What was the main difference?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_058.wav	1.92	I was an athlete.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_059.wav	4.35	There was a battle there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_061.wav	3.67	It was all in a short period of time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_062.wav	4.31	Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_063.wav	5.38	Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_064.wav	2.18	The script was funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_065.wav	2.65	He could make it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_066.wav	2.13	Try to save us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_067.wav	2.95	Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_068.wav	3.80	There is an element of racism in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_069.wav	3.50	I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_070.wav	3.50	The company yesterday refused to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_071.wav	2.99	He highlighted a lack of staff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_072.wav	3.37	They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_073.wav	3.25	Both sides have been hit by injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_074.wav	3.08	The girls are so lucky to be alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_075.wav	3.08	It is a job creation scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_076.wav	2.90	He is now resident in England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_077.wav	2.82	Even the one she loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_078.wav	2.90	I've got the shirt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_079.wav	2.99	This is the way things should be handled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_080.wav	3.80	Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_081.wav	4.52	That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_082.wav	2.61	I first met him last summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_083.wav	2.56	Nothing is yet confirmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_084.wav	2.82	Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_085.wav	2.26	Someone who cares
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_087.wav	4.74	Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_088.wav	2.52	And rugby fans can help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_089.wav	2.99	They have not done so this season so far.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_090.wav	4.48	The city council is a major property owner in the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_091.wav	2.82	Now the system is right behind us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_092.wav	2.73	Today I couldn't run on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_093.wav	4.70	A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_094.wav	3.16	Motherwell have no such good fortune.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_095.wav	4.01	That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_096.wav	2.82	The peace process will be buried!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_098.wav	2.69	I love the Dome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_099.wav	4.22	They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_100.wav	2.18	It was mayhem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_101.wav	4.01	A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_102.wav	3.67	Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_103.wav	3.33	We want to get to the final, anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_104.wav	3.12	They will want to perform well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_105.wav	4.83	Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_106.wav	2.01	I'm not depressed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_107.wav	2.69	It was his job to check.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_108.wav	1.79	Is that right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_109.wav	2.31	You had better believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_110.wav	2.65	We want to help them through it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_111.wav	2.99	It's not a new concept in jazz.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_112.wav	3.33	The breakdown was much later in her life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_113.wav	1.84	It's not fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_114.wav	4.10	We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_115.wav	2.61	He will emerge as a world leader.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_116.wav	2.61	I'm delighted about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_117.wav	2.18	I joined a group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_118.wav	3.59	There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_119.wav	4.27	Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_120.wav	4.65	An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_121.wav	2.60	You can spend money on housing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_122.wav	4.78	We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_123.wav	2.01	I'm so angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_124.wav	2.69	It has removed a bit of guilt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_125.wav	3.76	His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_126.wav	2.69	They keep the atmosphere in mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_127.wav	3.29	It's terrible that he has died the same way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_128.wav	4.23	Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_129.wav	4.06	Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_130.wav	4.52	The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_132.wav	1.97	What will happen then?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_133.wav	1.97	It's not true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_134.wav	3.76	Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_135.wav	3.03	Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_136.wav	4.35	On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_137.wav	2.09	It was typical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_138.wav	3.59	He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_139.wav	4.69	If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_140.wav	3.46	She hopes to study in Britain one day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_141.wav	3.67	The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_142.wav	2.13	He is severe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_143.wav	2.30	Is that Titanic?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_144.wav	3.42	That group reported just before Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_145.wav	2.73	I am just trying to do my job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_146.wav	4.01	It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_147.wav	4.01	The home side didn't stand a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_148.wav	3.84	The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_149.wav	4.10	We want to see the maximum of change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_150.wav	4.91	The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_151.wav	3.33	We also enjoyed a lot of support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_152.wav	3.63	They were later discharged from hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_153.wav	2.73	Neither side can win this war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_154.wav	3.76	Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_155.wav	3.16	Was this element always there?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_157.wav	3.37	It was so new, so exciting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_158.wav	3.07	But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_159.wav	3.29	I've put my own money into this project.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_160.wav	3.16	We do not get that impression now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_161.wav	4.31	Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_162.wav	2.65	We have to move forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_163.wav	4.87	Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_164.wav	3.03	We have a budget in March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_165.wav	2.48	There was no respite.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_166.wav	2.78	They will do their own thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_167.wav	2.65	The post will be unpaid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_168.wav	4.06	Waiting times for these services are too long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_169.wav	3.24	It is too much for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_170.wav	2.95	He was a crazy man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_171.wav	4.14	A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_172.wav	3.63	It became a book by itself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_173.wav	4.01	One season, they might do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_174.wav	4.99	However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_175.wav	2.31	And I saw the light!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_176.wav	3.54	He asked me in a tolerance zone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_177.wav	2.48	The clarity is vital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_178.wav	2.22	I drove the ball well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_179.wav	3.67	No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_180.wav	3.16	They know no other way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_181.wav	2.61	It is minute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_182.wav	2.48	They will run a mile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_183.wav	2.74	Four policemen were wounded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_184.wav	3.20	We did everything by the book.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_185.wav	4.66	Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_186.wav	3.07	What has caused the demise of singing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_187.wav	4.40	The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_188.wav	2.78	I wish I could say something.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_189.wav	4.36	We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_190.wav	4.27	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_191.wav	4.53	The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_192.wav	3.12	I wanted to put myself on the line.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_193.wav	1.71	Off I went.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_195.wav	2.82	It's the same old story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_196.wav	3.89	It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_197.wav	2.05	Is that success?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_198.wav	4.27	He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_199.wav	3.67	On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_200.wav	4.05	The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_202.wav	4.18	I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_203.wav	2.27	He's not perfect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_204.wav	2.99	They've got three-quarters of the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_205.wav	3.07	I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_206.wav	3.67	We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_207.wav	4.57	Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_208.wav	2.78	I don't want to use it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_209.wav	2.22	But I am a worried man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_210.wav	1.92	He knows a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_211.wav	3.08	It had all been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_212.wav	3.63	A Grampian Police spokesman said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_213.wav	2.52	His third goal was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_214.wav	2.44	It's been a good year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_215.wav	2.48	We want to keep the pound.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_216.wav	2.05	I was so nervous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_217.wav	4.74	A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_218.wav	3.67	The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_219.wav	2.78	IT S the real thing, for sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_220.wav	3.63	A career as a doctor is on hold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_221.wav	2.52	You have to do your research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_222.wav	4.05	At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_223.wav	2.78	We played them off the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_224.wav	2.73	But it will be sorted out this week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_225.wav	4.44	Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_226.wav	2.56	My neighbours are horrified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_227.wav	3.20	The track is currently covered in snow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_228.wav	2.82	Who would be right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_229.wav	2.82	It is set in Paris.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_230.wav	3.20	It is not the message alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_231.wav	3.03	Well, they were the unlucky ones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_232.wav	3.20	Hospitals are for the ill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_233.wav	4.57	The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_234.wav	3.88	We have a free vote on these things in our party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_235.wav	2.61	We were extremely poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_236.wav	4.14	He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_237.wav	4.74	We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_238.wav	2.18	It is hard won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_239.wav	4.65	A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_240.wav	3.42	Chambers said he would accept the place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_241.wav	3.88	Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_242.wav	3.76	In fact, we were all over the shop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_243.wav	2.65	The scene is about this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_244.wav	4.74	The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_245.wav	4.06	In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_246.wav	2.82	They are different types.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_247.wav	3.76	There will be widespread support on all sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_248.wav	3.67	He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_249.wav	3.03	This is the culture change in medicine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_250.wav	2.78	Her presence was almost everywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_251.wav	4.18	He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_252.wav	2.61	Special measures were needed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_253.wav	3.89	That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_254.wav	3.20	The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_255.wav	3.12	It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_256.wav	2.09	They are real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_257.wav	4.23	This court has made an order which has not been observed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_258.wav	4.19	Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_259.wav	2.73	That's the only thing I will say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_260.wav	2.01	It was good fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_261.wav	2.91	It looks as though he will be right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_262.wav	4.48	Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_264.wav	3.46	Immediate action must be taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_265.wav	2.39	It's very nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_266.wav	2.90	It left me with a sadness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_267.wav	4.35	Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_268.wav	2.73	And Michael was just great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_269.wav	4.14	Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_270.wav	2.78	Access has been a nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_271.wav	3.97	But he is caught between a rock and a hard place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_272.wav	4.35	A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_273.wav	4.02	Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_274.wav	3.03	It was a privilege to work for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_275.wav	2.14	It's so awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_276.wav	3.97	It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_277.wav	2.09	We are a grandmother.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_278.wav	2.82	We have to break that cycle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_279.wav	3.08	I saw it at a ruck.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_280.wav	4.36	Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_281.wav	4.31	But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_282.wav	2.61	Yet, it worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_283.wav	2.43	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_284.wav	4.40	It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_285.wav	3.33	The death toll included five children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_286.wav	4.36	A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_287.wav	3.50	It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_288.wav	3.67	It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_289.wav	2.82	It changed my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_290.wav	3.25	A new school will be built.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_291.wav	4.06	I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_292.wav	4.91	Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_293.wav	4.48	That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_294.wav	2.73	What has altered?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_295.wav	3.72	However, the snow was welcomed by some.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_296.wav	3.37	It just came into my head that day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_297.wav	2.90	Our task is to complete the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_298.wav	4.66	A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_299.wav	4.27	Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_300.wav	3.12	The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_301.wav	3.03	This is a war over our home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_302.wav	4.10	It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_303.wav	5.42	The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_304.wav	4.52	I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_305.wav	2.31	And he goes with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_306.wav	2.73	SCOTLAND has shown the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_307.wav	5.55	Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_308.wav	5.51	The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_309.wav	3.50	Is there on his hands?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_310.wav	3.25	It was a question of patience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_311.wav	2.43	I was rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_312.wav	2.44	Kids are terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_313.wav	2.69	It should be equal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_314.wav	3.33	Craig is a major concern for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_315.wav	3.67	The home team had an amazing start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_317.wav	2.09	It is out there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_319.wav	4.18	They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_320.wav	3.63	We think all other measures are not exhausted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_321.wav	3.37	In his absence, the council adopted the change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_322.wav	2.60	It is a strong case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_323.wav	4.01	They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_324.wav	3.12	Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_325.wav	3.72	I think I was recorded with a video camera.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_326.wav	3.03	We agreed to disagree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_327.wav	2.69	I'd like to take the plunge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_328.wav	3.93	My first concern is for the safety of the public.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_329.wav	2.73	I've not thought about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_330.wav	3.03	Who was the mystery MP?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_331.wav	1.97	It's been hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_332.wav	2.18	They should stop the bombing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_333.wav	1.71	Who will do it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_334.wav	3.07	However, Sharon rejected the claims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_336.wav	3.12	I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_337.wav	2.14	I must make that clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_338.wav	2.18	The train was on time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_340.wav	5.33	They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_342.wav	2.73	I would miss him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_343.wav	2.44	Tiger is the exception.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_344.wav	4.40	I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_345.wav	3.80	I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_346.wav	3.25	His contract was then not renewed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_347.wav	2.48	I got a yellow card.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_349.wav	4.31	A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_350.wav	2.82	There is a cup final at stake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_351.wav	5.63	Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_352.wav	3.54	The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_353.wav	4.10	In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_354.wav	3.12	As, indeed, they would be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_356.wav	4.27	It benefits the whole family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_357.wav	2.35	Our numbers are small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_358.wav	2.09	That would help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_359.wav	1.67	So I left.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_360.wav	2.73	We are looking for perfection.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_362.wav	2.86	This is a club on the rise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_363.wav	2.95	Equity declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_364.wav	4.31	We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_365.wav	3.59	The play is based on a real-life event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_366.wav	2.94	He could face a jail sentence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_368.wav	3.46	He put some colour into Scottish history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_369.wav	2.73	There was no hint of scandal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_370.wav	2.39	Safety was also an issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_371.wav	2.82	Well, the big day has arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_372.wav	3.97	By that time, however, it was already too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_373.wav	2.31	Talks are progressing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p241\p241_374.wav	2.56	There is no signature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_001.wav	2.61	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_002.wav	4.40	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_003.wav	8.19	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_004.wav	5.59	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_005.wav	6.87	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_006.wav	6.40	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_007.wav	5.21	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_008.wav	9.60	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_009.wav	5.46	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_010.wav	4.36	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_011.wav	7.81	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_012.wav	5.76	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_013.wav	5.59	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_014.wav	6.28	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_015.wav	6.06	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_016.wav	7.98	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_018.wav	6.19	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_019.wav	8.03	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_020.wav	5.29	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_021.wav	9.69	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_022.wav	7.81	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_023.wav	12.63	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_024.wav	7.38	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_025.wav	4.27	He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_026.wav	5.21	His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_027.wav	6.32	I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_028.wav	4.78	The west coast line is not just for middle England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_029.wav	2.65	The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_030.wav	3.37	She brought a lot to my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_031.wav	4.14	Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_032.wav	4.35	Thomson and his family left court without comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_033.wav	4.78	I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_034.wav	4.05	But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_035.wav	16.00	It is about control of our economy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_036.wav	4.44	Each brand was owned by a different family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_037.wav	3.84	That was not perfect golf by any means.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_038.wav	3.63	He added that her comments were noted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_039.wav	3.50	She will get through it I'm sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_040.wav	4.52	Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_041.wav	4.19	Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_042.wav	3.76	He does not even trust his own members.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_043.wav	3.80	He too started on the subs seats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_044.wav	2.48	Is it worth it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_045.wav	2.44	Does it matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_046.wav	2.82	How do you take them away ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_047.wav	3.63	However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_048.wav	3.50	After the match, do you ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_049.wav	2.48	Has the conflict started ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_050.wav	2.90	Have I really come to this ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_051.wav	3.38	I'm as fit as I can get.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_052.wav	4.61	We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_053.wav	4.82	He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_054.wav	5.68	The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_055.wav	3.67	Andy was a huge influence yet again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_056.wav	3.37	They seem too much of a sure thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_057.wav	3.63	Her husband had been waiting for her return.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_058.wav	3.80	You must always attempt to raise the bar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_059.wav	2.95	We just want this season to end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_060.wav	3.84	It was a day she thought she would never see.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_061.wav	3.67	Talks have continued at many different levels.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_062.wav	4.18	The referee is there to decide these things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_063.wav	4.22	There were no details of the other five victims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_064.wav	3.72	It also has a good labour supply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_065.wav	3.42	Indeed he has a lot of output.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_066.wav	3.42	Do not give your details to anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_067.wav	3.97	He was failed by his health authority.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_068.wav	3.33	But it was not all bad news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_069.wav	5.72	I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_070.wav	4.19	But during the bid process, that changed completely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_071.wav	3.84	It turned me against the whole system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_072.wav	5.59	She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_073.wav	5.25	I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_074.wav	4.14	But two groups refused to sign up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_075.wav	4.14	I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_076.wav	3.29	It had little effect on European equity markets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_077.wav	3.75	I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_078.wav	4.31	The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_079.wav	3.76	The squad spent the night at police headquarters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_080.wav	2.95	They said our costs were too high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_081.wav	3.72	I do not attempt to answer that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_082.wav	3.50	It's been a great evening for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_083.wav	3.20	That kind of growth is the important thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_084.wav	4.48	A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_085.wav	3.46	No plan for projects are yet in place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_086.wav	4.27	Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_087.wav	5.04	I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_088.wav	4.06	Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_089.wav	3.50	I feel I did not have enough time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_090.wav	4.01	Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_091.wav	3.80	I can't remember a lot about the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_092.wav	3.84	Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_093.wav	3.76	They had the appeal of TV stars.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_094.wav	4.18	There is no issue of national security involved here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_095.wav	3.59	He will be a very hard act to follow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_096.wav	5.12	Earlier, both main parties had agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_097.wav	3.63	Put simply, it goes something like this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_098.wav	5.17	Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_099.wav	3.58	Even if he doesn't have any lines.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_100.wav	2.90	I am delighted to hear this news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_101.wav	3.71	We are already seeing some positive results.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_102.wav	4.48	We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_103.wav	2.99	We were under a bit of pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_104.wav	2.95	They won't actually make any money from it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_105.wav	3.46	I bought a flat six years ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_106.wav	4.53	They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_107.wav	3.24	They are a different team at home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_108.wav	4.27	It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_109.wav	4.23	Scotland is never far away at Westminster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_110.wav	3.42	Some young girls also came by last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_111.wav	5.38	Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_112.wav	2.22	What are they for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_113.wav	2.22	Is there a waiting list ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_114.wav	2.91	Do they think anyone else wants them ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_115.wav	2.52	So what happens next ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_116.wav	2.86	Had this been common practice ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_117.wav	3.20	What do they want us to do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_118.wav	5.25	The idea is the shop within a shop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_119.wav	4.22	I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_120.wav	4.06	It is the right package for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_121.wav	4.70	They have no real friends in the region.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_122.wav	4.57	England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_123.wav	5.17	Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_125.wav	3.16	I think there's not much between them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_126.wav	2.95	So I am going in the right direction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_127.wav	4.10	Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_128.wav	2.95	We have to offer value for money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_129.wav	3.63	It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_130.wav	3.33	I could live without the attention, he admitted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_131.wav	3.08	He's got to look after himself now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_132.wav	4.87	He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_133.wav	3.71	No country has a similar training programme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_134.wav	3.46	There is no future in rock music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_135.wav	5.89	Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_136.wav	4.78	Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_137.wav	3.76	The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_138.wav	3.80	We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_139.wav	3.46	The programme has been made with great care.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_140.wav	3.46	There was only one living room, you see.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_141.wav	3.29	I am not under any new pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_142.wav	4.01	The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_143.wav	4.48	It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_144.wav	4.91	They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_145.wav	3.88	All eight victims were based in Germany.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_146.wav	4.10	Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_147.wav	3.46	You should feel involved in their lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_148.wav	3.63	It is open season on the Old Firm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_149.wav	2.78	Is it in the right place ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_150.wav	1.71	Did he trip ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_151.wav	2.61	Does that put pressure on us ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_152.wav	1.75	Did it work ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_153.wav	3.54	Do you think we are a top nation ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_154.wav	4.01	Three senior officials were dismissed last week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_155.wav	3.33	Time may already have run out for this option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_156.wav	4.27	No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_157.wav	3.37	When it happened, he could hardly believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_158.wav	4.18	They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_159.wav	4.23	As our national coach, Brown is done for.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_160.wav	4.01	A progress report will be published in October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_161.wav	3.54	This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_162.wav	3.67	That will reduce my chance of selection.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_163.wav	5.17	When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_164.wav	3.63	Surely it can't run for two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_165.wav	2.99	But the game is still wide open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_166.wav	4.53	It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_167.wav	5.04	However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_168.wav	4.18	I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_169.wav	3.80	We had to work very hard for our points.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_170.wav	3.63	That is a big risk at any price.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_171.wav	3.54	You need a long-term strategy in football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_172.wav	3.89	He said some things which were better left alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_173.wav	4.06	If successful, several records will be made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_174.wav	5.42	The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_175.wav	3.12	It didn't come as any great surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_176.wav	4.57	Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_177.wav	3.07	It's just a different way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_178.wav	4.48	Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_179.wav	3.08	Nato has left them with no other option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_180.wav	3.54	I am secure in my own position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_181.wav	4.05	Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_182.wav	3.33	She is believed to be in South Africa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_183.wav	5.29	The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_184.wav	2.99	We have come a long way since then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_185.wav	3.89	I made my mind up before we came on tour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_186.wav	4.44	A great player has to win major championships.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_187.wav	3.76	Highland health board has a responsibility here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_188.wav	3.80	I didn't miss the big house at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_189.wav	3.89	The story was not made public by this club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_190.wav	5.46	That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_191.wav	3.29	You are not long home from work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_192.wav	2.99	I am fighting the force of nature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_193.wav	3.37	It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_194.wav	3.93	Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_195.wav	2.52	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_196.wav	2.99	was everything done to save people ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_197.wav	2.73	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_198.wav	2.56	But they had to be paid for.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_199.wav	3.50	There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_200.wav	3.54	The police insisted that they were standard issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_201.wav	4.65	One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_202.wav	2.94	I've never had a year like this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_203.wav	3.88	Full details are expected to be released in June.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_204.wav	3.37	As you see with the fuel duty business, they do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_205.wav	3.12	Hague will be leader at the election after next.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_206.wav	4.35	He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_207.wav	3.54	I want an answer from the British Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_208.wav	3.88	Gas production was also at record levels last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_209.wav	3.50	They are a victim of their own success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_210.wav	3.46	We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_211.wav	3.41	This is a young squad and we're all supporters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_212.wav	2.94	It is going to change the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_213.wav	5.50	Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_214.wav	4.19	People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_215.wav	3.80	The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_216.wav	2.86	I am not going to judge them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_217.wav	3.37	I do not see this so much as failure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_218.wav	3.54	A European final must be the millennium target.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_219.wav	3.93	Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_220.wav	3.29	I was independent but I am not now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_221.wav	4.31	We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_222.wav	3.54	We are still seeking that complete performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_223.wav	4.23	My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_224.wav	4.19	Someone should force President Bush to watch this film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_225.wav	4.82	The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_226.wav	3.54	If not, a deal could take many months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_227.wav	4.18	This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_228.wav	3.76	Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_229.wav	3.46	I want to see as much progress as possible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_230.wav	4.35	This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_231.wav	4.40	I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_232.wav	5.25	The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_233.wav	4.10	They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_234.wav	3.88	The labour side has developed in the North area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_235.wav	2.30	You are not allowed to do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_236.wav	2.99	That is the last thing they need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_237.wav	3.76	He has worked for several years in the United States.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_238.wav	3.67	The children were later able to leave by bus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_239.wav	3.03	Jim was down there with his wife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_240.wav	2.27	Was it the wife ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_241.wav	1.84	Why change it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_242.wav	2.39	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_243.wav	2.31	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_244.wav	2.31	how do you get it back ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_245.wav	4.10	What are you not good at ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_246.wav	3.37	I think, therefore I am ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_247.wav	3.84	Church leaders warned other homes could close.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_248.wav	5.04	The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_249.wav	4.10	My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_250.wav	3.67	He has many offers from the English Premiership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_251.wav	3.59	However, the figures tell a different story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_252.wav	3.03	The rise has come too late for some.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_253.wav	3.08	Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_254.wav	3.63	I'd rather play well next week than here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_255.wav	4.99	Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_256.wav	3.97	The British Government should follow the Irish example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_257.wav	4.19	Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_258.wav	4.48	Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_259.wav	4.70	Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_260.wav	3.88	And they never show the same film as a rival.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_261.wav	4.31	Every player goes through this after a serious injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_262.wav	3.38	There would be a north and south division.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_263.wav	4.48	The same trend showed up throughout Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_264.wav	3.72	The two companies were not for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_265.wav	3.76	His condition was described as serious last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_266.wav	4.44	The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_267.wav	3.03	The board do not own the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_268.wav	3.80	Last night Bush carried it rather easily.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_269.wav	3.46	They always want to give a performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_270.wav	3.46	Its primary business channel is the internet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_271.wav	3.80	That's been the difference between the sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_272.wav	4.19	The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_273.wav	2.91	I think I was about four years old.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_274.wav	5.25	Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_275.wav	4.14	It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_276.wav	4.48	Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_277.wav	2.91	I think the shares are good value.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_278.wav	3.42	One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_279.wav	4.91	Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_280.wav	3.88	The life office will now stay with Abbey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_281.wav	4.87	Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_282.wav	4.14	Overall, the last hole was good to the women.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_283.wav	4.06	He may be ready for first team action in March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_284.wav	3.33	The fans pay for their season tickets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_286.wav	4.70	In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_287.wav	5.08	Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_288.wav	3.41	No-one had seen this sort of thing before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_289.wav	3.71	We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_290.wav	4.91	He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_291.wav	3.50	He would get into any world team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_292.wav	3.55	Its work includes dealing with child abuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_293.wav	3.24	They first met during a Step in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_294.wav	3.93	The agreement remains the only show in town.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_295.wav	4.91	The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_296.wav	3.97	The strong performance is expected to continue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_297.wav	5.17	Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_298.wav	3.84	It is based on population rather than need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_299.wav	3.12	He could understand both points of view.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_300.wav	2.35	So, did she meet him ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_301.wav	2.99	So what is the campaign about ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_302.wav	1.58	And does it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_303.wav	2.56	Are you from the rugby ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_304.wav	1.75	Had I heard ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_305.wav	2.48	What happened in that game ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_306.wav	2.05	Are you going to win ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_308.wav	4.06	Further heavy charges are expected this year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_309.wav	3.93	It happened on average once a week this year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_310.wav	5.17	This is the version which appeared in our paper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_311.wav	3.42	He is keen to stay in public service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_312.wav	3.67	Of course people will try the things they see on TV.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_313.wav	3.46	For that reason cover should not be given.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_314.wav	2.91	He felt too close to head office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_315.wav	3.03	If you believe in the blue and white.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_316.wav	3.59	A report on their property is due within days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_317.wav	2.65	He will just go on doing his job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_318.wav	2.99	I always felt they played for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_319.wav	4.35	That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_320.wav	5.21	The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_321.wav	5.29	This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_322.wav	4.23	We will not simply hit these people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_323.wav	3.50	We still think this trade is on the increase.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_324.wav	4.53	It is not either national standards or local control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_325.wav	5.21	His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_326.wav	4.35	I feel as if I can hole everything now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_327.wav	2.86	I try to be open to experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_328.wav	3.67	He is not exactly a pretty child.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_329.wav	3.08	I thought the race was a little bit slow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_330.wav	4.95	If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_331.wav	3.97	Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_332.wav	4.99	I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_333.wav	4.48	These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_334.wav	5.64	One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_335.wav	4.23	Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_336.wav	3.46	I hope numbers will be up on last time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_337.wav	2.99	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_338.wav	2.35	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_339.wav	2.30	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_340.wav	2.35	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_341.wav	3.33	Put another way, they just won't do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_342.wav	3.50	Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_343.wav	3.55	Getting that balance right can be very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_344.wav	4.35	Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_345.wav	4.31	Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_346.wav	3.16	It was a bit like having children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_347.wav	4.10	And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_348.wav	3.71	And that is the bottom line - box office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_349.wav	4.99	I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_350.wav	4.91	I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_352.wav	3.80	Sales will begin by the end of October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_353.wav	5.29	The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_354.wav	3.20	Friday night was a pretty good night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_355.wav	4.31	It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_356.wav	4.18	The deal is expected to be completed by September.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_357.wav	3.59	It is the only natural British site on the list.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_358.wav	3.50	His style was direct and very human.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_359.wav	4.36	Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_360.wav	3.33	They have the cash and the fire power.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_361.wav	3.50	The institute board will take the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_362.wav	3.16	He's young enough and he must learn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_363.wav	3.33	Such a policy is for long-term strength.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_364.wav	4.31	Both players gave so much to the side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_365.wav	3.93	Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_366.wav	3.55	The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_367.wav	4.83	The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_368.wav	3.42	It was a goal which came from nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_369.wav	4.10	We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_370.wav	3.80	I have come here to show support for the families.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_371.wav	3.25	We have been going for three years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_372.wav	3.29	He really played us into a corner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_373.wav	3.67	They know the truth, they really know the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_374.wav	3.37	It was another black day for Ayrshire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_375.wav	3.55	Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_376.wav	3.20	It used to be all hard sell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_377.wav	3.63	The direct effects on trade will be limited.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_378.wav	4.10	He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_379.wav	4.05	He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_380.wav	4.14	This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_381.wav	3.07	This is not a small amount of money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_382.wav	4.61	The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_383.wav	3.16	I just felt that I was broken down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_384.wav	2.05	What do we do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_385.wav	2.31	Why do it otherwise ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_386.wav	3.63	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_387.wav	3.84	The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_388.wav	4.66	Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_389.wav	4.05	He remains a main board director of Royal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_390.wav	4.19	His record on Government has always been highly effective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_391.wav	3.29	My tax affairs have been totally open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_392.wav	3.89	Five years ago its return was rejected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_393.wav	3.84	But soon the game dropped back into its old ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_394.wav	5.21	In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_395.wav	3.89	In that situation, they thought we should be beaten.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_396.wav	3.71	We are keen to see truth and justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_397.wav	4.61	The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p243\p243_398.wav	3.59	People have a wish to charge twice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_001.wav	2.18	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_002.wav	3.50	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_003.wav	6.49	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_004.wav	5.51	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_005.wav	6.53	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_006.wav	6.14	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_007.wav	4.74	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_008.wav	8.53	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_009.wav	5.76	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_010.wav	3.63	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_011.wav	7.34	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_012.wav	5.25	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_013.wav	4.74	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_014.wav	5.59	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_015.wav	6.36	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_016.wav	7.34	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_017.wav	4.18	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_018.wav	5.89	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_019.wav	7.81	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_020.wav	4.23	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_022.wav	6.79	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_023.wav	10.54	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_024.wav	7.13	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_025.wav	3.29	We are a service industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_026.wav	3.03	It may be good for the soul.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_027.wav	2.90	We want to lift the cup for the fans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_028.wav	4.40	I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_029.wav	3.63	It is about investing in the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_030.wav	4.27	However, the following year the cancer returned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_031.wav	3.50	They were in good humour, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_032.wav	2.90	The end result is the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_033.wav	2.61	It is on the internet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_034.wav	4.48	These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_035.wav	4.10	IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_036.wav	2.91	This is a central issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_037.wav	2.95	History is in the making.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_038.wav	3.97	Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_039.wav	3.12	She was there for the start of the campaign.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_040.wav	2.52	She was at the top.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_041.wav	4.14	In London today, it was business as usual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_042.wav	2.65	And they had a case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_043.wav	3.33	Something has to be put in place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_044.wav	3.97	If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_045.wav	2.99	They are going after them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_046.wav	2.52	It is all about the story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_047.wav	2.99	The whole thing is the music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_048.wav	4.01	In fact, they are the future of investment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_049.wav	2.48	That is still the case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_050.wav	4.01	At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_051.wav	3.03	In my view, it has to be done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_052.wav	3.42	The pressure on the players will build.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_053.wav	2.95	Their campaign is in disarray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_054.wav	4.57	But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_055.wav	3.12	Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_056.wav	3.80	It has been a horrible, horrible time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_057.wav	3.16	Clearly, they had other problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_058.wav	3.63	This trend is likely to strengthen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_059.wav	4.14	For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_060.wav	2.65	We have got to deliver.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_061.wav	2.86	That was the difference today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_062.wav	2.99	The company continues to grow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_063.wav	2.61	He said it was for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_064.wav	2.27	We felt it was sufficient.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_065.wav	2.61	That is all in the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_066.wav	2.52	There is a lot to be done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_067.wav	3.93	But that's another story for another day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_068.wav	2.95	He has not been dropped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_069.wav	3.16	It was an outstanding performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_070.wav	3.29	I can't remember a lot about the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_071.wav	5.55	Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_072.wav	2.95	It is only the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_073.wav	4.69	Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_074.wav	3.37	Only water is currently allowed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_075.wav	3.41	This time, it might be for real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_076.wav	3.29	She did that for the rest of her life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_077.wav	3.46	Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_078.wav	2.31	That will be the office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_079.wav	3.29	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_080.wav	2.31	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_081.wav	2.43	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_082.wav	2.39	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_083.wav	2.35	What do we do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_084.wav	2.56	Why do it otherwise ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_085.wav	2.31	It starts with the script.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_086.wav	5.04	Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_087.wav	3.16	It would have been around the turn of the century.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_088.wav	4.70	I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_089.wav	3.84	Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_090.wav	2.86	It seems a good thing to try.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_091.wav	4.78	However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_092.wav	2.86	It sounds a lot of money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_093.wav	3.97	However, a ruling will not come before next week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_094.wav	3.03	It is not a story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_095.wav	4.87	However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_096.wav	2.73	He is in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_097.wav	4.65	I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_098.wav	2.95	It took an option on the process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_099.wav	3.08	By then, he was walking on water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_100.wav	3.42	This is a game of confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_101.wav	3.25	On Saturday, it was much the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_102.wav	4.31	He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_103.wav	3.76	The door is still open, but we need a bit of help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_104.wav	2.90	The trick is to try it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_105.wav	3.88	I had no intention of misleading anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_106.wav	3.07	Victory was never in doubt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_107.wav	5.55	This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_108.wav	5.42	On this occasion, the case for a public inquiry was not made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_109.wav	5.08	Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_110.wav	3.03	Then again, we could have.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_111.wav	3.67	There, you were just a body.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_112.wav	3.08	But he has not become a monster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_113.wav	2.82	He is not a dancer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_114.wav	3.97	We had planned to sell the property for some time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_115.wav	4.69	A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_116.wav	3.46	In the end we have to take a stand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_117.wav	3.46	This is a sea change in approach.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_118.wav	3.38	Otherwise, the market may come back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_119.wav	3.33	The procedures were not in place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_120.wav	3.42	For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_121.wav	3.67	In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_122.wav	3.50	He was not alone at the top of the board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_123.wav	5.04	The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_124.wav	4.10	While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_125.wav	2.22	We had a great time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_126.wav	3.97	I am delighted to have been the captain of the winning side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_127.wav	4.40	According to criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_128.wav	3.33	It was far from business as usual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_129.wav	2.60	He wanted to record the group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_130.wav	3.80	He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_131.wav	4.86	Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_132.wav	2.99	It is hard to believe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_133.wav	2.09	Or it would have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_134.wav	3.72	Three days later, he was killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_135.wav	3.54	Football is a passion for many.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_136.wav	3.12	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_137.wav	2.95	So, did she meet him ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_138.wav	2.82	So what is the campaign about ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_139.wav	2.01	And does it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_140.wav	2.61	Are you from the rugby ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_141.wav	3.84	However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_142.wav	2.65	That was the first step.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_143.wav	4.23	However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_144.wav	2.95	I have been in contact with him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_145.wav	2.95	Actors like to be in the centre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_146.wav	4.31	When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_147.wav	4.52	They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_148.wav	3.63	I am the manager of Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_149.wav	3.71	There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_150.wav	2.90	There were no grounds for his action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_151.wav	3.08	I can't even get into the A team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_152.wav	2.95	It starts at the top.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_153.wav	3.33	Others are expected to follow the lead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_154.wav	3.03	She does not want to speak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_155.wav	3.80	It was all for good reason as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_156.wav	4.27	One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_157.wav	4.44	It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_158.wav	3.76	As for the warning, it was not needed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_159.wav	4.01	If not, a deal could take many months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_160.wav	2.78	We want to get there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_161.wav	4.87	On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_162.wav	3.03	There is a lack of staff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_163.wav	3.20	Not that the occasion was without restraint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_164.wav	4.10	Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_165.wav	4.31	This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_166.wav	4.70	At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_167.wav	3.89	Full consent is expected by the end of next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_168.wav	4.44	Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_169.wav	2.65	Anyone can do the sums.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_170.wav	3.93	We have to create it in the playing strength of the team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_171.wav	3.93	It is not about the money, it is about everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_172.wav	4.83	Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_173.wav	4.06	We were all over the place in the first half.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_174.wav	3.80	Like the others, he was arrested.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_175.wav	3.33	All the pressure was on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_176.wav	5.08	Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_177.wav	3.25	They have not been named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_178.wav	3.03	It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_179.wav	4.91	I think the Labour party is completely split on this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_180.wav	3.54	It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_181.wav	3.03	I was always in control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_182.wav	2.65	It was by the numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_183.wav	3.80	I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_184.wav	2.82	It should never have happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_185.wav	3.80	Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_186.wav	3.25	The feeling is hard to describe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_187.wav	2.73	It is difficult to say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_188.wav	3.42	That is a question for the next manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_189.wav	4.78	By then, however, both men were already in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_190.wav	4.52	However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_191.wav	2.86	It is simply not true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_192.wav	2.78	Are you going to win ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_193.wav	2.78	Was it the wife ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_194.wav	2.39	Why change it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_195.wav	3.63	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_196.wav	2.61	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_197.wav	3.59	That you can do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_198.wav	4.05	I would like to continue to develop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_199.wav	4.23	First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_200.wav	3.76	He has defended the system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_201.wav	3.50	We want to begin a programme in the UK.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_203.wav	5.12	At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_204.wav	2.61	It is not an issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_205.wav	3.29	They have to get that sorted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_206.wav	2.22	We can take the city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_207.wav	2.90	He played it like a veteran.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_208.wav	3.16	It was the story of the second half.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_209.wav	3.84	Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_210.wav	4.01	As many as the market will support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_211.wav	3.03	He is believed to live in Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_212.wav	3.37	Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_213.wav	4.48	The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_214.wav	2.99	This conference was never confirmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_215.wav	2.39	A team is a team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_216.wav	4.70	However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_217.wav	3.50	I'm interested in interesting work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_218.wav	3.41	It decided to blame the media.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_219.wav	2.73	THE force is with them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_220.wav	4.57	This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_221.wav	3.07	It was important to win today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_222.wav	3.29	He was not injured in the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_223.wav	2.90	Because he was born in England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_224.wav	4.82	Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_225.wav	5.42	Milk producers were in need of immediate assistance, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_226.wav	3.59	I was not overly concerned about this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_227.wav	3.59	However, it is not as simple as this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_228.wav	3.37	We want this place to work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_229.wav	2.77	It still has an effect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_230.wav	4.18	The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_231.wav	4.57	I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_232.wav	4.27	Other villages were completely deserted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_233.wav	2.94	There is a lot of concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_234.wav	3.76	It will be decided in the next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_235.wav	2.86	We have to win the group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_236.wav	3.84	It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_237.wav	4.35	We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_238.wav	3.59	We have an election in eight days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_239.wav	3.03	There was a lot of resentment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_240.wav	3.42	This is a fight to the death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_241.wav	4.27	All will be revealed in due course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_242.wav	3.20	He is a man of the people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_243.wav	2.78	The matter is under appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_244.wav	2.90	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_245.wav	2.95	was everything done to save people ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_246.wav	3.63	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_247.wav	2.99	Do I think about them often ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_248.wav	2.77	Is it in the right place ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_249.wav	2.35	Did he trip ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_250.wav	2.91	Sadly, it could not be done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_251.wav	3.72	I wouldn't even respond to that question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_252.wav	4.53	Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_253.wav	3.46	Instead, he missed the lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_254.wav	3.16	I was never in danger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_255.wav	2.65	A lot has been written.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_256.wav	4.14	In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_257.wav	3.29	It was really good in the first week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_258.wav	2.86	If it doesn't, it doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_259.wav	4.22	However, the ball refused to sit for the Frenchman.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_260.wav	3.33	That is not the case in Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_261.wav	2.48	But it was a loss.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_262.wav	4.22	So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_263.wav	3.59	The performance continues to improve.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_264.wav	2.90	It expected this trend to continue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_265.wav	4.06	However, no further action was taken by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_266.wav	3.71	It depends on Labour, not on us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_267.wav	3.29	But we were in control at that point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_268.wav	2.90	It has to be enforced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_269.wav	3.80	The party has never fully recovered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_270.wav	4.35	Moreover, it must be for all sports.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_271.wav	3.46	But the government has so far failed to listen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_272.wav	2.86	He must have a crack at it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_273.wav	3.25	I am still waiting for a reply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_274.wav	4.23	Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_275.wav	3.29	He was good, but not that good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_276.wav	4.48	The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_277.wav	5.25	Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_278.wav	3.63	However, the matter is not going to end there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_279.wav	3.46	It might be sad, but it's a fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_280.wav	4.10	In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_281.wav	3.76	Obviously, we would want to look at this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_282.wav	4.14	On a practical level, it would be difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_283.wav	4.48	If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_284.wav	3.54	It is important that he is involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_285.wav	4.44	If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_286.wav	4.82	It should be noted that he has been released without charge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_287.wav	4.49	In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_288.wav	4.27	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_290.wav	2.69	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_291.wav	3.42	None of the agencies was able to help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_292.wav	2.52	I didn't see the point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_293.wav	3.76	This idea has been around for four years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_294.wav	2.91	We are in a war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_295.wav	3.37	Do you think we are a top nation ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_296.wav	3.63	Is our children learning ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_297.wav	3.72	How independent is that ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_298.wav	3.33	What form did that take ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_299.wav	2.90	Are they free ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_300.wav	3.55	Scotland won by six wickets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_301.wav	5.47	However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_302.wav	3.63	This is a historic agreement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_303.wav	2.48	We have to be realistic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_304.wav	2.73	Every one is a winner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_305.wav	2.94	There was a hole in it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_306.wav	3.16	It will be done in stages.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_307.wav	4.27	It all started with a visiting rugby club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_308.wav	3.37	Every character was completely different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_309.wav	3.33	But it is a similar problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_310.wav	5.08	In the UK, inflation data will be published this morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_311.wav	4.44	But it is important for a number of reasons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_312.wav	3.71	In that moment, I was happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_313.wav	4.18	All of the management has invested in the firm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_314.wav	4.69	It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_315.wav	3.42	They were not at the property yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_316.wav	3.16	It involved the same people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_317.wav	3.42	We want to get back into the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_318.wav	3.03	We have to be very, very careful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_319.wav	3.07	Look at the potential of this club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_320.wav	3.12	Hopefully, this week will be good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_321.wav	5.16	This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_322.wav	2.65	We did something about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_323.wav	2.91	But it is up again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_324.wav	3.80	However, the devil is in the detail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_325.wav	4.10	For the moment, however, the position is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_326.wav	5.29	The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_327.wav	2.65	He is already in place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_328.wav	3.46	Another difference is the cost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_329.wav	6.40	Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_330.wav	3.03	And we can do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_331.wav	2.86	What are they for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_333.wav	3.97	Do they think anyone else wants them ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_334.wav	3.50	Tax is a matter for national governments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_335.wav	3.37	And it's a goodbye from him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_336.wav	3.07	It is a sensitive issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_337.wav	2.95	They have to be addressed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_338.wav	4.36	This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_339.wav	3.76	Like many companies, it is a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_340.wav	5.51	The business is mainly active in Europe, the US and Australia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_341.wav	3.46	However, a bid was never made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_342.wav	4.14	That is the lesson of the last three weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_343.wav	3.55	Something is going to have to give.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_344.wav	3.97	And the context is also completely different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_345.wav	5.08	The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_346.wav	3.67	The banking sector was weak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_347.wav	3.21	But the New Year was special.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_348.wav	3.67	We never played at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_349.wav	4.06	However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_350.wav	3.25	This isn't the end of story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_351.wav	2.61	He is a great prospect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_352.wav	3.20	He has been told by the doctor to rest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_353.wav	4.14	However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_354.wav	3.59	Of course, it does not have to be this way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_355.wav	3.72	This latter suggestion is very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_356.wav	3.63	However, it does not tell the full story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_357.wav	3.03	They were impressive against France.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_358.wav	2.73	The challenge is to win a cup.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_359.wav	3.25	Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_360.wav	3.08	It was a test in itself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_361.wav	3.29	Either team will be hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_362.wav	3.24	The parents will have a great time, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_363.wav	3.59	At first, the youngster was not keen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_364.wav	4.61	However, it has to be seen as part of a package.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_365.wav	5.51	On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_366.wav	4.66	In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_367.wav	3.50	Lately, that market has come under pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_368.wav	4.06	In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_369.wav	3.33	However, it was well worth the wait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_370.wav	4.44	The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_371.wav	2.48	I have a good feeling about this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_372.wav	2.95	The news is not all bad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_373.wav	3.50	Some of the passing was a disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_374.wav	3.93	However, it does not seem to be the case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_375.wav	3.46	It is almost certain to be the last.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_376.wav	2.82	You have to be patient.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_377.wav	4.48	However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_378.wav	3.46	I was delighted to accept.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_379.wav	4.78	A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_380.wav	3.67	We are not going to fight in Kosovo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_381.wav	4.99	Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_382.wav	2.90	It's fantastic to win again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_383.wav	4.31	For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_384.wav	4.44	The company won the first round but lost on appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_385.wav	3.20	Everything is in the mix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_386.wav	3.33	An announcement is expected this week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_387.wav	3.29	He will be difficult to replace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_388.wav	3.76	I would be interested in another attempt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_389.wav	4.40	In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_390.wav	3.12	He was on a mission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_391.wav	2.05	Does it matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_392.wav	3.12	How do you take them away ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_393.wav	3.63	However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_394.wav	3.84	After the match, do you ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_395.wav	3.46	One-third of the places are already taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_396.wav	3.55	I understand the frustration of the fans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_397.wav	4.65	Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_398.wav	4.01	On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_399.wav	2.90	I want this one to be different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_400.wav	3.80	It is the last meeting of the season.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_401.wav	4.91	Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_402.wav	6.15	We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_403.wav	2.52	He is a quality player.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_404.wav	3.97	The service is expected to be introduced in December.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_405.wav	3.20	It's all been about the basics of the business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_406.wav	2.31	There is a demand for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_407.wav	3.50	It's great that it happened in Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_408.wav	4.19	I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_409.wav	3.80	They are not going the length of the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_410.wav	4.53	Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_411.wav	4.10	However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_412.wav	4.48	Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_413.wav	3.21	Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_414.wav	4.36	In order to get there, we have got to invest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_415.wav	3.67	Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_416.wav	2.61	There is no need to panic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_417.wav	2.82	It had been on the cards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_418.wav	3.97	However, he said the proposal was at an early stage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_419.wav	5.04	Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_420.wav	3.07	That might mean another delay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_421.wav	4.61	One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_422.wav	3.29	I am delighted for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_423.wav	3.46	He's had to suffer for the last six years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p244\p244_424.wav	2.69	But it was a struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_001.wav	2.18	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_002.wav	4.31	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_003.wav	9.22	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_004.wav	6.32	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_005.wav	7.85	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_006.wav	7.09	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_007.wav	5.50	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_008.wav	9.35	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_009.wav	5.34	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_010.wav	4.10	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_011.wav	8.24	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_012.wav	5.12	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_013.wav	5.38	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_014.wav	6.32	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_015.wav	6.92	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_016.wav	8.15	Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_017.wav	4.19	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_018.wav	6.49	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_019.wav	8.11	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_020.wav	4.95	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_021.wav	10.92	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_022.wav	8.84	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_023.wav	14.00	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_024.wav	9.43	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_025.wav	3.72	Johnson was pretty low.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_026.wav	2.61	But it failed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_027.wav	2.39	It's nice to hear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_028.wav	5.00	We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_029.wav	6.19	Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_030.wav	3.85	They should be so lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_031.wav	4.65	Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_032.wav	5.17	They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_033.wav	2.82	I was an athlete.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_034.wav	5.89	They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_035.wav	5.93	So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_036.wav	5.21	Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_037.wav	4.23	However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_038.wav	2.35	It has failed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_039.wav	2.30	It was clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_040.wav	2.31	It's a great thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_041.wav	2.43	Indeed, he does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_042.wav	4.74	People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_043.wav	4.53	She is believed to be in South Africa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_044.wav	3.97	But it took a lot of bottle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_045.wav	2.35	Sure, it's funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_046.wav	4.23	Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_047.wav	4.10	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_048.wav	3.46	We need to chat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_049.wav	3.76	The boy is no longer with us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_050.wav	2.10	Who can say?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_051.wav	2.27	It's a blessing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_053.wav	5.17	Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_054.wav	2.95	They had to explain it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_055.wav	2.61	He had no enemies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_056.wav	2.60	Sadly, it can't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_057.wav	3.25	None has ever been found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_058.wav	3.38	It's a matter of balance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_059.wav	4.78	There will be tough opponents to this report.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_060.wav	5.16	Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_061.wav	4.01	Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_062.wav	3.46	He should have asked for a second opinion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_063.wav	2.35	He was popular.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_064.wav	5.59	Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_065.wav	2.48	The script was funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_066.wav	2.73	You need a trademark.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_067.wav	3.84	There is an element of racism in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_068.wav	5.55	The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_069.wav	3.84	She died in hospital two hours later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_070.wav	3.03	Is there a new way forward?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_071.wav	5.00	There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_072.wav	3.63	People must remain vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_073.wav	3.29	This is the way things should be handled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_074.wav	4.70	Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_075.wav	2.48	What has changed?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_076.wav	3.76	I'd like to continue that record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_077.wav	2.90	That is bound to happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_078.wav	3.50	He seems to be pleased with the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_079.wav	2.65	We have other options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_080.wav	5.16	The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_081.wav	5.47	It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_082.wav	2.65	It's never too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_083.wav	5.51	Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_084.wav	3.59	Now the system is right behind us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_085.wav	5.80	Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_086.wav	2.56	It is a lifeline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_087.wav	4.91	The reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_088.wav	2.99	Then came the crunch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_089.wav	2.60	If you could find it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_090.wav	4.91	Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_091.wav	3.42	They were outside the circle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_092.wav	2.65	He's a star.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_093.wav	4.74	It was some time before she found out he was safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_094.wav	4.01	We want to get to the final, anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_095.wav	3.08	Oil embargo endorsed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_096.wav	3.88	No date has been set for the appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_097.wav	2.94	It was an adventure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_098.wav	5.34	Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_099.wav	4.05	They had to be cut from the wreckage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_100.wav	2.82	I was angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_101.wav	4.57	That team is due to be announced this morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_102.wav	4.23	I have had no social life at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_103.wav	4.70	Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_104.wav	3.41	I'm delighted about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_105.wav	4.10	We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_106.wav	3.72	Who would be a referee?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_107.wav	4.99	There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_108.wav	2.86	Who would have?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_109.wav	4.40	The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_110.wav	3.29	We work on the same level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_111.wav	3.46	I can't even get into the A team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_112.wav	4.14	Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_113.wav	5.30	Next season for every manager is a long time away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_114.wav	4.02	They keep the atmosphere in mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_115.wav	5.25	Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_116.wav	4.57	I do not think this family will ever get over this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_117.wav	5.12	Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_118.wav	3.84	He has been under great pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_119.wav	3.41	Who will attend?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_120.wav	4.78	However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_121.wav	4.83	The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_122.wav	2.82	What will happen then?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_123.wav	2.61	Is that it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_124.wav	3.55	He was in a great deal of pain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_125.wav	3.29	We want to keep the pound.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_126.wav	4.57	Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_127.wav	3.58	There is a lack of chemistry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_128.wav	2.31	I was awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_129.wav	4.10	That group reported just before Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_130.wav	3.93	It is not just about pay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_131.wav	3.76	He will emerge as a world leader.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_132.wav	2.39	They did very well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_133.wav	3.71	It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_134.wav	4.91	The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_135.wav	4.61	The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_136.wav	4.87	It was deployed in the Gulf War.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_137.wav	4.78	Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_138.wav	2.91	Mr Blair had done well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_139.wav	6.74	It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_140.wav	4.31	The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_141.wav	2.69	He can do no wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_142.wav	3.72	Was this element always there?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_143.wav	2.78	I've learned from my mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_144.wav	4.74	A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_145.wav	2.65	It has to be now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_146.wav	3.54	I was in the train station overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_147.wav	3.55	The release attracted little attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_148.wav	2.82	That will do for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_149.wav	3.59	Nobody did in those days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_150.wav	5.63	It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_151.wav	4.19	They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_152.wav	3.63	It became a book by itself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_154.wav	3.88	We wanted it left for a wee while.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_155.wav	4.95	However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_156.wav	3.20	The hotel was now for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_157.wav	2.52	I drove the ball well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_158.wav	3.08	Everyone can be bought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_160.wav	4.06	We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_161.wav	5.12	I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_162.wav	3.37	They will run a mile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_163.wav	2.90	We did everything by the book.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_164.wav	2.48	It is not fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_165.wav	3.41	What has caused the demise of singing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_166.wav	2.78	I had a train to catch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_167.wav	3.76	It was an odd affair, in many respects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_168.wav	3.12	It is tough, but possible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_170.wav	4.40	The procedure is the same in all cases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_171.wav	2.77	People will ask about us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_172.wav	4.91	I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_173.wav	3.50	We must keep our feet on the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_174.wav	4.40	However, he said the money had not been wasted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_175.wav	4.40	Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_176.wav	5.12	Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_177.wav	5.08	It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_178.wav	4.01	It was still there, but right at the end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_179.wav	3.63	The conference is the first test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_180.wav	2.78	Is that success?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_181.wav	3.84	But we are not immune to the problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_182.wav	3.07	The red card was okay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_183.wav	2.01	I have a cold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_184.wav	2.56	They are in the euro.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_185.wav	4.01	He's not perfect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_186.wav	4.49	The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_187.wav	4.74	I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_188.wav	3.63	It's all about money, money, money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_189.wav	2.73	That will be vital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_190.wav	2.95	Now, it's all right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_191.wav	2.73	It's like a garage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_192.wav	2.99	We don't even know his name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_193.wav	2.35	Feel the heat?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_194.wav	2.69	He knows a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_195.wav	2.78	I began to pray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_196.wav	3.84	I had decided to quit the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_197.wav	3.37	His third goal was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_198.wav	3.63	It's been a good year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_199.wav	4.82	The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_200.wav	4.57	So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_201.wav	5.30	On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_202.wav	6.02	He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_203.wav	5.72	The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_204.wav	5.72	Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_205.wav	4.61	The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_206.wav	4.48	But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_207.wav	5.04	Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_208.wav	3.88	He demanded to speak to the boss.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_209.wav	3.54	You have to do your research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_210.wav	3.33	Saturday is gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_211.wav	4.99	The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_212.wav	6.62	Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_213.wav	2.65	It was good fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_214.wav	4.40	At the time, he was a living legend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_215.wav	2.86	It's so special.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_216.wav	4.87	You should always be able to get out in some direction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_217.wav	2.99	I can't wait to meet him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_218.wav	4.53	My wife and family are the support system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_219.wav	4.57	The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_220.wav	2.60	They had no children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_221.wav	2.65	We are in the hat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_222.wav	2.56	We were a load of rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_223.wav	5.08	They should come forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_224.wav	4.31	It is not the message alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_225.wav	4.95	Half of young people had had contact with the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_226.wav	2.95	It's quite a line-up!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_227.wav	3.67	I might get an injury very easily.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_228.wav	4.31	This fact is supported by audience research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_229.wav	3.76	He was good, but not that good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_230.wav	4.66	The problem in Norway is outside the National.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_231.wav	4.95	He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_232.wav	6.28	Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_233.wav	4.57	It would appear that it has not been a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_234.wav	2.44	It's only fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_235.wav	4.78	He says that he is no different from any other man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_236.wav	3.46	You can feel at home in China.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_237.wav	4.35	We did not compete with any other local farmer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_238.wav	5.85	It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_239.wav	3.84	There wasn't a goal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_240.wav	2.56	I was shocked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_241.wav	2.86	They are different types.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_242.wav	2.14	It was a hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_243.wav	3.71	I didn't need to watch it on the video.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_244.wav	4.78	There will be widespread support on all sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_245.wav	3.29	This year I understood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_246.wav	3.63	Her presence was almost everywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_247.wav	3.46	They need to look after themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_248.wav	3.97	Is there on his hands?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_249.wav	2.69	I can't get a job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_250.wav	2.22	It is nearly there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_251.wav	4.57	He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_252.wav	5.89	For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_253.wav	3.12	It's that kind of place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_254.wav	2.69	they fail to engage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_256.wav	2.91	I was happily surprised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_257.wav	5.29	However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_258.wav	3.33	I would have the hammer in the crowd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_259.wav	2.56	I HAVE a dream.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_260.wav	3.24	It is set in Paris.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_261.wav	5.34	There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_262.wav	5.29	Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_263.wav	3.33	Immediate action must be taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_264.wav	3.16	It left me with a sadness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_265.wav	4.69	Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_266.wav	6.02	We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_267.wav	3.97	Our objective is to tackle poverty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_268.wav	3.50	Of course I was tempted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_269.wav	5.51	However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_270.wav	2.90	People have no choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_271.wav	2.69	She looked so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_272.wav	3.25	It happens from time to time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_273.wav	5.34	Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_274.wav	4.91	This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_275.wav	3.63	You've got to have both sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_276.wav	4.74	Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_277.wav	3.16	It was a virus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_278.wav	2.82	Yet, it worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_279.wav	2.43	It's very safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_280.wav	2.78	Well, he can do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_281.wav	4.44	He was obviously very genuine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_282.wav	3.29	It goes back a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_283.wav	3.16	The weather forecast isn't good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_284.wav	4.78	It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_285.wav	5.97	He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_286.wav	5.55	But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_287.wav	2.82	That could change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_288.wav	2.65	The goals will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_289.wav	3.37	Sunday's game was not a trial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_290.wav	3.12	This is a huge confidence boost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_291.wav	3.54	We have to sort it out ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_292.wav	2.48	He has retired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_293.wav	3.59	There was no hint of scandal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_294.wav	5.16	I thought it was my only chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_295.wav	2.90	Nothing is safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_296.wav	2.22	They are wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_297.wav	5.38	The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_298.wav	3.37	The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_299.wav	3.80	We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_300.wav	2.82	It's just not funny!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_301.wav	5.59	Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_302.wav	2.73	And he goes with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_303.wav	2.69	You are the glory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_304.wav	5.63	A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_305.wav	3.84	We want to play at the worlds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_306.wav	3.93	We have waited a long time for this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_307.wav	2.90	He was solid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_308.wav	3.97	This is the culture change in medicine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_309.wav	5.63	and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_310.wav	5.55	It also provides a wealth of contrast within the movement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_311.wav	3.84	I never thought it would take this long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_312.wav	3.93	They wanted the club to make money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_313.wav	3.80	Craig is a major concern for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_314.wav	4.52	For the moment, our position remains the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_315.wav	3.33	They had a confession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_316.wav	3.63	I am very happy to be here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_317.wav	5.55	We think all other measures are not exhausted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_318.wav	2.99	There was no time scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_319.wav	3.89	My view has now completely changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_320.wav	4.44	Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_321.wav	3.89	It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_322.wav	3.37	The boat was fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_323.wav	3.33	I saw some good things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_324.wav	4.87	Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_325.wav	5.55	You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_326.wav	5.08	In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_327.wav	4.99	Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_328.wav	4.78	The same things will happen with GM foods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_329.wav	5.34	Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_330.wav	2.52	Who will do it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_331.wav	5.08	I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_332.wav	5.29	That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_333.wav	4.82	I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_334.wav	5.29	I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_335.wav	3.16	The train was on time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_336.wav	3.59	Action is needed now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_337.wav	5.98	But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_338.wav	3.93	Indeed, it was magical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_339.wav	3.76	I would miss him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_340.wav	2.77	There's no place to hide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_341.wav	6.49	Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_342.wav	2.56	I'm very lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_343.wav	2.95	It was forced to divert.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_344.wav	4.06	Chambers said he would accept the place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_345.wav	3.80	He was then replaced by Ross.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_346.wav	5.51	A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_347.wav	3.89	Like his acting, it was an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_348.wav	3.72	They should take their mobile phones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_349.wav	4.06	It is not like working for a living.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_350.wav	4.48	Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_351.wav	5.17	A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_352.wav	5.42	The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_353.wav	3.84	The decision is an absolute disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_354.wav	2.95	It was very formal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_355.wav	4.52	The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_356.wav	4.10	It's not that clear-cut.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_357.wav	4.18	You must have a government and a good civil service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_358.wav	2.82	He's very explosive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p245\p245_359.wav	2.61	But nothing happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_001.wav	2.82	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_002.wav	4.31	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_003.wav	8.79	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_004.wav	6.27	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_005.wav	8.07	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_006.wav	7.34	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_007.wav	6.02	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_008.wav	8.88	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_009.wav	5.76	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_010.wav	3.93	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_011.wav	8.32	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_012.wav	5.59	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_013.wav	5.08	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_014.wav	5.89	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_015.wav	6.96	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_016.wav	8.07	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_017.wav	4.36	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_018.wav	7.77	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_019.wav	8.45	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_020.wav	5.08	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_021.wav	10.16	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_022.wav	8.58	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_023.wav	13.02	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_024.wav	7.55	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_025.wav	3.25	He has not been named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_026.wav	3.80	We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_027.wav	2.52	Is this accurate?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_028.wav	4.65	However, the following year the cancer returned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_029.wav	5.38	They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_030.wav	3.54	There's a story, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_031.wav	2.31	This is the window.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_032.wav	2.95	He was jailed for five years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_033.wav	4.44	We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_034.wav	2.82	Then, suddenly, they weren't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_035.wav	4.19	Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_036.wav	1.80	It has failed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_037.wav	1.96	They're just different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_038.wav	5.34	Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_039.wav	2.35	Indeed, he does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_040.wav	4.83	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_041.wav	3.67	The ambition this year is to improve on last.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_042.wav	4.61	It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_043.wav	4.31	It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_044.wav	2.05	We will push.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_045.wav	4.83	Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_046.wav	3.12	They said she was stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_047.wav	2.26	Is a drug dealer?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_048.wav	2.44	There is no reason at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_049.wav	2.43	The State would provide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_050.wav	2.43	She looked so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_051.wav	3.38	Every aspect of our play was first class.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_052.wav	2.01	Here's a clue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_053.wav	3.97	Her body was found about four miles from the car.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_054.wav	4.01	For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_055.wav	2.05	It is unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_056.wav	4.57	This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_057.wav	2.18	That's the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_058.wav	3.08	I feel I did not have enough time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_059.wav	4.44	The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_060.wav	3.03	Scotland had great assets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_061.wav	2.61	It's that kind of place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_062.wav	4.61	There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_063.wav	2.01	He could make it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_064.wav	3.29	Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_065.wav	3.08	Robin Williams is very subdued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_066.wav	3.41	The tournament has now been cancelled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_067.wav	2.73	There could be a way back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_068.wav	3.24	Then followed a bout of flu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_069.wav	6.27	Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_070.wav	2.86	It is a job creation scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_071.wav	5.12	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_072.wav	2.39	Even the one she loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_073.wav	2.90	People must remain vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_074.wav	2.39	Today she has been released.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_075.wav	4.10	The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_076.wav	4.22	It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_077.wav	2.99	He is in the queue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_078.wav	2.86	I first met him last summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_079.wav	3.33	He seems to be pleased with the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_080.wav	3.12	A play is a set of actions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_081.wav	4.40	Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_082.wav	1.88	It is a blow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_083.wav	3.84	Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_084.wav	2.22	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_085.wav	2.52	It will be tight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_086.wav	4.74	The city council is a major property owner in the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_087.wav	5.29	Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_088.wav	2.43	Tony Blair said as little.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_089.wav	2.95	As, indeed, they would be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_090.wav	2.09	This one did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_091.wav	2.01	It was clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_092.wav	2.01	But I was wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_093.wav	2.44	It is home-grown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_094.wav	2.13	I saw the whole thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_095.wav	5.98	Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_096.wav	4.31	However, we have not come to any conclusions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_097.wav	4.44	They make a selective perception process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_098.wav	5.93	Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_099.wav	3.16	No, the equipment is extra.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_100.wav	2.48	That would be unlawful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_101.wav	3.12	Oil embargo endorsed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_102.wav	4.18	But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_103.wav	3.16	Before the game we went for a pint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_104.wav	2.52	It was an adventure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_105.wav	4.87	According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_106.wav	3.46	I was fighting for my life, I thought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_107.wav	1.97	Is that right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_108.wav	3.20	I had some time with Aston Villa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_109.wav	2.39	It was the eighties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_110.wav	2.26	It is so sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_111.wav	3.84	It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_112.wav	4.23	They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_113.wav	2.56	Who would be a referee?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_114.wav	4.87	That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_115.wav	4.14	There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_116.wav	2.77	Who would have?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_117.wav	3.63	Here, again, they were denied a voice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_118.wav	3.03	There were no grounds for his action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_119.wav	4.57	It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_120.wav	3.67	She really suffered for her art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_121.wav	4.40	It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_122.wav	2.95	It is not a U-turn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_123.wav	2.35	I just wanted a break.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_124.wav	3.33	Twaddle is a case in point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_125.wav	2.77	I am now unemployed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_126.wav	3.67	She said she would not welcome the flowers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_127.wav	3.59	It plans to return to this field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_128.wav	2.48	It's perfectly feasible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_129.wav	2.52	We work well together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_130.wav	5.33	Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_131.wav	5.68	On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_132.wav	5.17	We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_133.wav	2.48	My daughter is an adult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_134.wav	4.74	He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_135.wav	3.93	It seems so long since I did the exams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_136.wav	4.82	Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_137.wav	5.29	We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_138.wav	5.08	No-one in Downing Street can speak the language of the unions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_139.wav	2.69	She died at her home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_140.wav	2.99	He realises his mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_141.wav	5.29	He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_142.wav	1.96	I was awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_143.wav	4.78	They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_144.wav	3.37	Washington is consumed by the crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_145.wav	6.27	He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_146.wav	3.67	It is not just about pay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_147.wav	2.95	I am just trying to do my job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_148.wav	5.85	He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_149.wav	5.94	It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_150.wav	2.18	I was stunned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_151.wav	5.42	But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_152.wav	4.23	The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_153.wav	5.55	The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_154.wav	3.67	She had gone to the Catholic school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_155.wav	3.29	We are on a four-year mission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_156.wav	4.95	She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_157.wav	4.10	This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_158.wav	3.03	I'd love to be like Peter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_159.wav	2.09	I will tell you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_160.wav	5.85	Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_161.wav	2.65	It is not like us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_162.wav	5.04	It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_163.wav	2.86	We have a budget in March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_164.wav	2.77	Again, we were lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_165.wav	3.12	We should do everything at a stroke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_166.wav	2.69	You had to go and see him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_167.wav	5.72	It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_168.wav	2.22	He was a crazy man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_169.wav	2.14	As we worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_170.wav	5.42	However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_171.wav	4.27	It is not either national standards or local control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_172.wav	2.99	If that's the case, he will struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_173.wav	2.48	I drove the ball well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_174.wav	2.78	Tony had arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_175.wav	4.95	The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_176.wav	5.21	I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_177.wav	2.09	The goals were good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_178.wav	5.29	And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_179.wav	4.61	Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_180.wav	2.95	They need to look after themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_181.wav	3.29	It's to do with context.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_182.wav	1.67	Does this matter?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_183.wav	2.61	One was a lawyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_184.wav	3.07	There is no openness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_185.wav	3.84	Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_186.wav	4.48	I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_187.wav	4.65	It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_188.wav	3.29	It was very frightened and dirty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_189.wav	4.91	The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_190.wav	2.56	The concerns are the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_191.wav	2.14	Is that success?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_192.wav	3.25	I do not own the vessel in question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_193.wav	4.05	On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_194.wav	5.38	I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_195.wav	2.26	Who will pay for this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_196.wav	3.46	They've got three-quarters of the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_197.wav	5.55	The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_198.wav	3.50	It's all about money, money, money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_199.wav	5.34	Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_200.wav	3.46	We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_201.wav	2.22	I will win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_202.wav	1.97	Feel the heat?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_203.wav	2.01	He knows a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_204.wav	5.72	We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_205.wav	2.52	It had all been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_206.wav	2.73	I have decided to quit the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_207.wav	2.43	My neighbours are horrified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_208.wav	1.80	It's not ideal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_209.wav	3.42	In each case they were a goal down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_210.wav	3.59	I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_211.wav	4.35	However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_212.wav	4.53	For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_213.wav	4.61	On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_214.wav	6.02	The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_215.wav	3.12	The report is due out next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_216.wav	3.12	Because they didn't want to know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_217.wav	4.83	At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_218.wav	2.73	If it doesn't, it doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_219.wav	5.12	Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_220.wav	4.48	It's a question of creating a future awareness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_221.wav	3.12	I'd never seen a play about me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_222.wav	3.42	It's not before time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_223.wav	3.63	I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_224.wav	3.76	He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_225.wav	1.84	But she was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_226.wav	6.66	Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_227.wav	3.38	At the time, he was a living legend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_228.wav	3.76	My wife and family are the support system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_229.wav	6.19	Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_230.wav	4.40	The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_231.wav	4.39	But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_232.wav	2.48	Of course I was tempted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_233.wav	2.82	Well, they were the unlucky ones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_234.wav	1.75	You should be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_235.wav	2.22	It's quite nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_236.wav	4.69	The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_237.wav	4.82	Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_238.wav	3.20	In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_239.wav	5.21	A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_240.wav	3.59	It is hard won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_241.wav	3.72	We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_242.wav	4.74	I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_243.wav	2.56	The scene is about this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_244.wav	4.70	We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_245.wav	4.44	In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_246.wav	2.31	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_247.wav	2.43	It was a hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_248.wav	1.66	There's the mix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_249.wav	4.65	After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_250.wav	2.86	Is there on his hands?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_251.wav	2.48	I can't get a job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_252.wav	4.44	That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_253.wav	2.78	they fail to engage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_254.wav	5.12	One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_255.wav	3.16	Is that a serious question?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_256.wav	2.73	They must play for each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_257.wav	3.33	I could have got out a long time ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_258.wav	4.95	He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_259.wav	5.93	However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_260.wav	3.29	There's not much money in cycling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_261.wav	2.82	Souter will be back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_262.wav	3.46	Blood samples were taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_263.wav	3.37	They want to shut the Scottish Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_264.wav	3.16	It will be done in stages.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_265.wav	2.05	There is no link.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_266.wav	5.21	That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_267.wav	5.04	Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_268.wav	1.80	We are happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_270.wav	2.52	We're in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_271.wav	4.27	Our objective is to tackle poverty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_272.wav	5.21	Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_273.wav	2.73	It's a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_274.wav	5.38	The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.

VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_277.wav	3.07	They seem to get away with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_278.wav	4.14	In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_279.wav	2.78	It is so very obvious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_280.wav	4.10	In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_281.wav	1.75	It's so awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_282.wav	2.95	If not, he should go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_283.wav	4.87	It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_284.wav	3.20	We are a grandmother.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_285.wav	3.16	But I've won both ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_286.wav	4.48	Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_287.wav	2.91	You feel very helpless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_288.wav	4.23	This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_289.wav	2.65	Dialogue is the key.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_290.wav	3.63	He will address the nation this evening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_291.wav	2.26	It was a virus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_292.wav	2.05	Yet, it worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_293.wav	4.48	The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_294.wav	1.50	It was good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_295.wav	2.95	Bombing slaughter rejected
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_296.wav	2.91	We are not going to forget.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_297.wav	1.71	No Briton has ever won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_298.wav	3.38	And huge, indeed, it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_299.wav	5.04	Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_300.wav	2.82	He was at home with his pals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_301.wav	2.30	What has altered?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_302.wav	2.14	She is really magic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_303.wav	4.61	The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_304.wav	5.33	A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_305.wav	4.87	Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_306.wav	3.63	We could easily be cut again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_307.wav	2.10	The plot is minimal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_308.wav	2.35	You are the glory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_309.wav	2.60	The minister is the engineer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_310.wav	2.52	The letters are going out today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_311.wav	4.95	I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_312.wav	5.59	and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_313.wav	3.84	We have got no money to go anywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_314.wav	3.33	She is on a life support machine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_315.wav	2.91	We are a peaceful people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_316.wav	3.46	The election is total confusion and chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_318.wav	5.04	Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_319.wav	2.35	They had a confession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_320.wav	3.16	I came into this world with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_321.wav	2.48	It's too horrible to think.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_322.wav	2.22	Off with their heads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_323.wav	2.82	There was no time scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_324.wav	2.82	Either team will be hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_325.wav	4.61	It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_326.wav	2.31	He scored a touchdown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_327.wav	2.01	Is that an issue?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_328.wav	3.89	You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_329.wav	1.92	Who will do it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_330.wav	4.23	I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_331.wav	3.16	Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_332.wav	2.39	This is the last straw.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_333.wav	2.82	Two people were interviewed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_334.wav	2.31	I've got no secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_335.wav	2.09	He loved the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_336.wav	1.93	I'm very lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_337.wav	2.31	Our policy is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_338.wav	4.91	In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_339.wav	3.59	Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_340.wav	5.12	A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_341.wav	6.10	This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_342.wav	3.33	They should take their mobile phones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_343.wav	2.60	I got a yellow card.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_344.wav	4.53	The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_345.wav	3.12	He had taken everything from me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_346.wav	4.65	He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_347.wav	5.72	Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_348.wav	2.95	Until they came to do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_349.wav	4.57	You must have a government and a good civil service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_350.wav	3.20	The pair are very much in love.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_351.wav	3.42	I was in the train station overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_352.wav	4.74	To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_353.wav	2.39	Hartley should know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_354.wav	1.75	That would help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_355.wav	1.96	It is a memorial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_357.wav	4.18	He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_358.wav	2.01	Their time has gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_359.wav	3.80	All the investment is possible through the public sector.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_360.wav	4.40	We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p246\p246_361.wav	4.74	For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_001.wav	2.35	Please call Stella.  )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_002.wav	3.55	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_003.wav	7.51	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_004.wav	5.42	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_005.wav	6.66	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_006.wav	6.02	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_007.wav	5.13	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_008.wav	7.55	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_009.wav	5.42	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_010.wav	3.59	People look, but no one ever finds it. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_011.wav	6.91	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_012.wav	5.12	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_013.wav	5.04	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_014.wav	5.17	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_016.wav	6.66	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_017.wav	4.10	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_018.wav	5.63	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_019.wav	7.26	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_020.wav	4.70	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_021.wav	8.92	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_022.wav	8.83	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_023.wav	10.71	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_024.wav	7.30	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_025.wav	3.71	They are very clever in their use of words.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_026.wav	3.54	Meetings will also remain private.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_027.wav	4.27	Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_028.wav	2.69	Because we do not need it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_029.wav	3.50	A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_030.wav	3.84	Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_031.wav	3.97	I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_032.wav	3.50	It is not for any other purpose.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_033.wav	3.12	It carried a double message.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_034.wav	3.67	The company did not declare a dividend.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_035.wav	3.16	That is the face of fear.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_036.wav	4.95	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_037.wav	4.48	The ambition this year is to improve on last.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_038.wav	3.93	You must always attempt to raise the bar.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_039.wav	3.72	It depends on the decisions of the member states.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_040.wav	3.67	It is serious - but not that serious.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_041.wav	3.16	The boy is no longer with us.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_042.wav	3.07	They said she was stable.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_043.wav	3.29	Among them are many criminals.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_044.wav	3.63	Merger would be entirely logical.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_045.wav	3.12	Everything is possible in football.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_046.wav	2.99	It's not a swimming pool out there.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_047.wav	3.50	Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_048.wav	4.40	It had little effect on European equity markets.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_049.wav	4.23	Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_050.wav	3.72	The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_051.wav	3.55	We would have concerns about suspension.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_052.wav	3.76	The couple actually came upon the accident.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_053.wav	3.97	The problems are a result of that shortfall.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_054.wav	2.95	Italy is a beautiful place.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_055.wav	2.91	We have to keep our clients.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_056.wav	5.21	The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_057.wav	3.37	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_058.wav	2.18	How are you, sir ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_059.wav	2.99	So is that it, then ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_060.wav	2.65	Do I have a favourite ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_061.wav	2.18	What do we do ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_062.wav	2.56	Why do it otherwise ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_063.wav	3.80	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_064.wav	5.42	George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_065.wav	2.82	We will pay their bills.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_066.wav	4.14	We could soon be in that same position!)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_067.wav	2.52	It came as a surprise.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_068.wav	3.29	The Farmer wants a new campaign.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_069.wav	3.50	Only water is currently allowed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_070.wav	3.20	It's not covered by the insurance.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_071.wav	3.63	Final proposals will be published in February.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_072.wav	3.08	You should try to have a laugh.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_073.wav	3.67	Robin Williams is very subdued.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_074.wav	3.46	It wasn't possible to relax.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_075.wav	3.50	I was very pleased with them today, though.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_076.wav	3.80	The spirit in the dressing room is tremendous.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_077.wav	2.73	I was as strong as a horse.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_078.wav	3.63	They do not work for Glasgow City Council.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_079.wav	3.29	Both men were on one-year contracts.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_080.wav	3.97	Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_081.wav	3.50	She died in hospital two hours later.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_082.wav	3.33	It happens on an annual basis.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_083.wav	2.90	It is a job creation scheme.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_084.wav	2.78	The party is up for it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_085.wav	2.69	Even the one she loved.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_086.wav	3.16	It makes for an interesting conference.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_087.wav	3.25	I've had it for the exams.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_088.wav	2.69	Those people must be accountable.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_089.wav	4.18	We feel very comfortable in this international environment.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_090.wav	3.16	Petrol prices were widely blamed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_091.wav	3.16	We have to offer value for money.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_092.wav	3.58	Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_093.wav	3.46	On Saturday, it was much the same.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_094.wav	2.61	They lived for their children.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_095.wav	2.90	Potions said he would drive.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_096.wav	3.07	The woman is basically off her head.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_097.wav	3.41	I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_098.wav	4.18	He had missed a penalty against the English.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_099.wav	3.37	The oil companies would be asked to contribute.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_100.wav	2.60	And they had a case.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_101.wav	3.03	It was clear on Thursday.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_102.wav	2.30	But it is up again.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_103.wav	2.73	She has so much to offer.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_104.wav	3.89	Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_105.wav	4.14	Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_106.wav	3.42	Our preference is to play in midweek.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_107.wav	3.42	We haven't finished the complaints procedure.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_108.wav	3.12	We made a world record together.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_109.wav	3.33	The following are the principal provisions.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_110.wav	3.42	Before the game we went for a pint.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_111.wav	3.03	Our house was very small.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_112.wav	3.46	Athletics is on a roll in the country.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_113.wav	4.70	Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_114.wav	4.10	The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_115.wav	3.33	Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_116.wav	3.20	We deserve a significant rise.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_117.wav	2.52	You had better believe it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_118.wav	2.99	The website has changed the company.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_119.wav	2.56	This is a step backwards.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_120.wav	2.69	There's still plenty time left.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_121.wav	2.74	That might help a bit.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_122.wav	2.65	However, the problem is timing.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_123.wav	3.59	It isn't a happy memory.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_124.wav	2.65	We have the mental strength.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_125.wav	4.70	Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_126.wav	3.08	You can spend money on housing.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_127.wav	3.16	I can't even get into the A team.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_128.wav	4.27	He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_129.wav	3.72	In addition, investor choice is reduced.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_130.wav	3.50	We suffered a lot for seven years.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_131.wav	3.63	They keep the atmosphere in mind.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_132.wav	3.63	Which can happen any time.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_133.wav	4.31	The answer was in space.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_134.wav	4.10	But it could be a consequence of our policy.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_135.wav	4.23	It is the latter which has prompted the warning.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_136.wav	3.08	This should begin in October.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_137.wav	4.01	However, the players should have a voice in these matters.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_138.wav	2.78	We did what we had to do.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_139.wav	3.29	But it is different in different regions.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_140.wav	3.38	This is the highlight of my career.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_141.wav	3.63	They made such decisions in London.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_142.wav	3.12	I learned that only yesterday.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_143.wav	3.24	I have accepted the challenge.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_144.wav	3.76	But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_145.wav	2.78	You are a gambling man.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_146.wav	3.25	This represents a tough game for us.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_147.wav	2.95	My daughter is an adult.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_148.wav	2.61	What happened in that game ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_149.wav	2.52	Are you going to win ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_150.wav	2.26	Was it the wife ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_151.wav	2.09	Why change it ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_152.wav	2.99	What do we want to do that for ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_153.wav	2.26	Does the name matter ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_154.wav	2.61	how do you get it back ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_155.wav	2.65	That is the ultimate revenge.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_156.wav	2.61	Before it was an ordeal.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_157.wav	3.20	I love the spectacle of cinema.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_158.wav	2.73	Anyone can do the sums.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_159.wav	3.37	I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_160.wav	4.01	Commercial producers were present in large numbers.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_161.wav	3.54	His second goal was equally impressive.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_162.wav	4.40	Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_163.wav	2.69	He's not a Celtic man.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_164.wav	2.86	That view has not altered.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_165.wav	3.93	IT S all change at Kilmarnock.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_166.wav	2.82	It has become a way of life.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_167.wav	2.78	There's always the next century.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_168.wav	3.29	Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_169.wav	2.99	It is not normal practice.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_170.wav	2.43	Nothing was meant by it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_171.wav	4.99	The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_172.wav	2.73	It was by the numbers.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_173.wav	2.35	We will turn the corner.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_174.wav	3.63	The strong pound also took its toll.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_175.wav	3.59	The strong performance is expected to continue.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_176.wav	6.02	Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_177.wav	3.50	That must be left to the Parole Board.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_178.wav	3.76	Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_179.wav	4.18	The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_180.wav	3.63	They could not match it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_181.wav	2.95	I always felt they played for me.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_182.wav	4.23	His team management was protective.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_183.wav	3.46	One season, they might do well.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_184.wav	4.40	It is not either national standards or local control.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_185.wav	3.54	City sentiment is in his favour.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_186.wav	3.41	It is vital to clarify their role.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_187.wav	3.24	I'm just going to hit the shot.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_188.wav	3.12	Talks are at an advanced stage.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_189.wav	3.93	They bought the property four years ago.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_190.wav	3.59	The Royal Highland was no exception.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_191.wav	2.31	I put the drawing down.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_192.wav	2.86	I will have to order its destruction.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_193.wav	2.56	You know the sort of thing.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_194.wav	2.78	They were seriously after him.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_195.wav	2.91	It shows the strength of the roots.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_196.wav	2.99	I'm interested in interesting work.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_197.wav	3.54	We represent a wide range of society.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_198.wav	2.65	It caused a lot of upset.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_199.wav	3.93	That could bring the peace process to a standstill.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_200.wav	2.99	It's very difficult to find a buyer.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_202.wav	3.54	Mr Blair was ready for him.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_203.wav	2.82	Because he was born in England.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_204.wav	3.16	They have the cash and the fire power.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_205.wav	3.50	The early physical reports were clear.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_206.wav	3.03	The result is utterly compelling.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_207.wav	3.12	It gave no further details.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_208.wav	3.16	This will take several weeks.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_209.wav	3.03	It was worth a photograph.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_210.wav	4.01	Losing in that manner is very hard to take.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_211.wav	3.12	January is a bad time of year.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_212.wav	3.12	His injury was completely random.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_213.wav	3.55	Harry Potter has lost his magic.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_214.wav	2.60	I had relied on him.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_215.wav	2.82	And they were being paid ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_216.wav	3.20	was everything done to save people ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_217.wav	3.12	What was the matter for concern ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_218.wav	2.99	Do I think about them often ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_219.wav	2.99	Is it in the right place ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_220.wav	2.18	Did he trip ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_221.wav	3.29	We used to live with dignity in our country.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_222.wav	4.95	The output price index in December was unchanged on November.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_223.wav	3.33	His third goal was superb.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_224.wav	3.63	It was finally agreed on Saturday.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_225.wav	2.86	I am considered a teenager.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_226.wav	3.07	The process will start tomorrow.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_227.wav	4.52	A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_228.wav	3.25	The transaction is not feasible.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_229.wav	4.19	They all made the European Ryder Cup team.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_230.wav	3.59	William Hague delighted his party.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_231.wav	4.57	At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_232.wav	2.95	We played them off the pitch.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_233.wav	3.03	It will be strictly cross-country.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_234.wav	3.97	Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_235.wav	3.84	Truth is the child of time.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_236.wav	4.27	I didn't play too well in the third quarter.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_237.wav	3.72	The scientific debate is dead.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_238.wav	4.35	A small number of new jobs will also be created.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_239.wav	4.23	Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_240.wav	3.97	He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_241.wav	2.60	She was an only child.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_242.wav	3.80	The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_243.wav	3.63	They have to be able to play the game.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_244.wav	3.29	I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_245.wav	3.41	Those overseas offices were great.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_246.wav	3.97	Half of young people had had contact with the police.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_247.wav	3.07	I am not going to go tomorrow.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_248.wav	2.99	Three weeks later, he resigned.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_249.wav	2.69	Others agreed with this view.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_250.wav	3.55	I have never heard a rule that you could be too young.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_251.wav	4.06	It is not an option, but a policy requirement.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_252.wav	5.17	Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_253.wav	4.23	Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_254.wav	3.16	I have received no explanation.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_255.wav	2.91	Mr Smith declined to comment.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_256.wav	2.99	It might be sad, but it's a fact.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_257.wav	3.20	Kingfisher can afford to wait.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_258.wav	3.08	Labour was too busy to respond.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_259.wav	3.59	You can never tell with the manager.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_260.wav	3.12	We have no information on Iraq.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_261.wav	2.91	Persuaded to change his mind.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_262.wav	3.89	Either way, the investor retains the premium.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_263.wav	3.25	He has also cut a record.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_264.wav	3.93	Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_265.wav	3.37	Washington is consumed by the crisis.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_266.wav	3.80	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_267.wav	3.80	There will be widespread support on all sides.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_268.wav	3.12	Messages have to be reinforced.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_269.wav	2.78	I didn't see the point.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_270.wav	2.78	Does that put pressure on us ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_271.wav	1.58	Did it work ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_272.wav	2.99	Do you think we are a top nation ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_273.wav	2.61	Is our children learning ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_274.wav	2.48	How independent is that ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_275.wav	2.73	What form did that take ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_276.wav	3.59	Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_277.wav	3.07	He is quite well organised.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_278.wav	3.24	On the contrary they stand to gain.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_279.wav	3.63	It was a minor incident.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_280.wav	3.25	Scotland won by six wickets.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_281.wav	3.71	They are interior designers and architects.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_282.wav	3.41	There were no problems with the crowds.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_283.wav	3.20	They must play for each other.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_284.wav	3.03	These figures are truly terrible.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_285.wav	3.88	Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_286.wav	3.08	It is also very valuable.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_287.wav	2.99	There's not much money in cycling.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_288.wav	3.16	None of this work is guaranteed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_289.wav	6.58	It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_290.wav	4.53	The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_291.wav	3.50	It opens the door to the Champions League.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_292.wav	3.24	It was exactly four months away.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_293.wav	2.95	I understand the security issue.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_294.wav	2.48	It was never a free kick.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_295.wav	4.05	We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_296.wav	2.39	It's hard to see it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_297.wav	2.69	A revival is under way.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_298.wav	2.52	They were worth the money.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_299.wav	3.25	The circumstances have changed since last year.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_300.wav	3.33	It's all designed to speed up the service.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_301.wav	3.03	We will deliver at director level.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_302.wav	3.33	I wanted to change the formula.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_303.wav	3.37	Mr Clinton was asked about his memory.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_304.wav	4.10	He will address the nation this evening.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_305.wav	2.56	Tony Blair said as little.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_306.wav	3.50	Motherwell have no such good fortune.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_307.wav	3.46	But it has been an amazing experience.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_308.wav	3.93	We would hope to make progress on that next year.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_309.wav	3.59	The rescue package is public money.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_310.wav	4.31	A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_311.wav	2.90	The effect was almost magical.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_312.wav	3.37	I was there five months ago.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_314.wav	4.19	Britain is going to celebrate in style.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_315.wav	2.99	His job was not advertised.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_316.wav	3.63	Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_317.wav	3.50	He was obviously very genuine.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_318.wav	3.37	The weather will be unpredictable if anything.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_319.wav	2.99	His appeal is instantly understood.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_320.wav	2.91	I first met him last summer.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_321.wav	2.86	A Home Office spokesman said.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_322.wav	4.31	Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_323.wav	2.78	There was no hint of scandal.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_324.wav	3.29	I was brought up in a mining background.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_325.wav	3.55	His only reply was a laugh.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_326.wav	4.18	I thought his speech was a disgrace.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_327.wav	3.08	Job losses were also announced.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_328.wav	4.35	We believe the world has too many refugees already.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_329.wav	3.37	Investors can be forgiven for caution.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_330.wav	2.73	The party lasted all night.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_331.wav	2.73	This is a moment to seize.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_332.wav	3.03	They come to enjoy themselves.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_333.wav	2.65	The people will not be patient.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_334.wav	2.31	And he goes with it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_335.wav	2.35	Scotland has shown the way.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_336.wav	2.90	Then followed a bout of flu.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_337.wav	2.82	We will listen to any suggestion.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_338.wav	2.69	It was an achievement all right.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_339.wav	3.63	The election is total confusion and chaos.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_340.wav	4.14	The whole thing is utterly transparent.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_341.wav	4.48	Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_342.wav	3.46	It is inherent in society.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_343.wav	1.92	Are they free ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_344.wav	2.18	What are they for ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_345.wav	2.22	Is there a waiting list ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_346.wav	3.12	Do they think anyone else wants them ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_347.wav	2.60	So what happens next ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_348.wav	3.37	Had this been common practice ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_349.wav	3.16	What do they want us to do ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_350.wav	1.92	Is it worth it ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_351.wav	4.31	Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_352.wav	2.65	There was some merit in that.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_353.wav	4.14	Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_354.wav	3.16	That is a trend which will be encouraged.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_355.wav	3.03	But the New Year was special.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_356.wav	2.99	Other people had looked at it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_357.wav	3.16	It was tough to contain the excitement.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_358.wav	2.69	The pain is still acute.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_359.wav	2.86	He said something in his work.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_360.wav	2.69	It's wonderful to have won.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_361.wav	4.14	Brian Wilson is a former Member to watch award winner.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_362.wav	6.53	In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_363.wav	4.95	It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_364.wav	2.91	But we welcome this document.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_365.wav	4.52	It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_366.wav	3.24	He can handle it without any problem.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_367.wav	4.44	The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_368.wav	2.48	I think we'll just keep it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_369.wav	2.52	It is a stroke of genius.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_370.wav	3.20	He had no access to the database.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_371.wav	2.82	The members have voted against it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_372.wav	2.99	He had no previous convictions.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_373.wav	2.95	Neither woman has been named.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_374.wav	2.61	I got a yellow card.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_375.wav	2.31	They have broken that promise.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_376.wav	2.65	That is a crazy situation.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_377.wav	3.71	Two things were clear from the new programme.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_378.wav	3.24	Yesterday was a statement of intent.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_379.wav	2.86	The group is not paying a dividend.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_380.wav	4.48	The policy has led to a big increase in customer recruitment.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_381.wav	3.88	The major championships will always have a special place.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_382.wav	3.16	There is no deal as yet.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_383.wav	3.16	It's as wide as a church in here.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_384.wav	3.63	In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_385.wav	3.33	to have products for their needs.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_386.wav	2.90	The pair are very much in love.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_387.wav	3.12	The team hadn't been picked.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_388.wav	3.12	It benefits the whole family.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_389.wav	4.40	Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_390.wav	3.63	Glasgow University declined to comment.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_391.wav	2.95	He will consult the right people.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_392.wav	3.76	Rugby has an extended run.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_393.wav	2.95	It has happened for generations.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_394.wav	2.61	Theatre is not a museum.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_395.wav	2.77	He took over our lives.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_396.wav	2.52	It seems a long time ago.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_397.wav	3.29	They have not done so this season so far.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_398.wav	2.56	It is a simple equation.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_399.wav	2.99	Ferguson must take the blame.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_400.wav	3.25	That investment has now been secured.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_401.wav	2.39	It proved a good decision.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_402.wav	3.93	I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_403.wav	3.71	I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_404.wav	3.29	The BBC was a disgrace.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_405.wav	3.63	The Cabinet is split over the issue.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_406.wav	3.03	But the foundations have been laid.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_407.wav	3.33	There was an element of frustration.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_408.wav	3.97	But they can also be managed by telephone.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_409.wav	3.54	The idea was first mooted a year ago.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_410.wav	2.99	The casualties were not named.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_411.wav	1.84	Does it matter ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_412.wav	2.39	How do you take them away ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_413.wav	3.03	However, there is an issue, isn't there ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_414.wav	2.48	After the match, do you ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_415.wav	3.50	Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_416.wav	3.76	George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_417.wav	3.72	Shelter also supports the reform.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_418.wav	3.93	This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_419.wav	4.01	The company hopes to repeat the process in France.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_420.wav	3.80	That is not the position of the British relatives.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_421.wav	3.03	He seems to be used to the attention.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_422.wav	3.89	The projections are very positive for South Africa.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_423.wav	3.16	That's been all around Europe with me.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_424.wav	3.59	Surrey police said no body had been found.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_425.wav	3.80	It was submitted without their knowledge.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_426.wav	3.55	Being captain of this club is fantastic.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_427.wav	2.99	My aim is a top six finish.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_428.wav	3.93	A similar scheme is under way in central Scotland.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_429.wav	2.78	Such an attack is bizarre.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_430.wav	5.04	The success of the Open Eye has enabled the business to expand.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_431.wav	3.76	No date has been fixed for his return.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_432.wav	2.82	It was a breathtaking moment.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_433.wav	3.80	Last weekend was extremely frustrating.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_434.wav	3.29	No-one wanted to run it tonight.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_435.wav	2.90	It's going to be epic.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_436.wav	2.82	There is another important factor.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_437.wav	2.78	We've made a couple of albums.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_438.wav	3.16	Strangely enough I felt very sharp.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_439.wav	3.50	An alternative must be offered.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_440.wav	3.59	The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_441.wav	2.69	There is no hiding place.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_442.wav	3.37	Their condition is described as satisfactory.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_443.wav	5.98	Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_444.wav	4.10	The Allies intend to maintain the average.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_445.wav	4.44	Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_446.wav	2.99	It wouldn't matter if he had.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_447.wav	3.29	That will be best for him.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_448.wav	2.77	There were no formal announcements.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_449.wav	2.44	He deserves a second chance.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_450.wav	2.82	It certainly appeared that way.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_451.wav	3.33	But you can go beyond that condition.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_452.wav	3.67	Blair is very positive at European Councils.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_453.wav	3.46	It could cause a little bit of disruption.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_454.wav	3.07	Police have appealed for witnesses.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_455.wav	3.37	People are so negative about the whole business.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_456.wav	4.05	Discussions will continue with the industry in Scotland.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_457.wav	4.14	It recommended that they reject the proposed legislation.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_458.wav	4.52	It might be useful to have something in black and white.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_459.wav	3.33	The damage is all inside.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_460.wav	2.77	The boys are mentally focused.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_461.wav	2.95	It's because they can't understand the language.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_462.wav	3.59	Then came the farewell to Europe.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_463.wav	4.05	The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_464.wav	3.80	I'm very passionate about my country.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_465.wav	3.37	Phil Mickelson did that last year.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_466.wav	2.78	I think it's a great system.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_467.wav	3.07	They're just a good retailer.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_468.wav	3.16	That should get their attention.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_469.wav	3.03	Now that business is banned.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_470.wav	3.41	They were good years for him.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_471.wav	4.87	At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_472.wav	3.20	And it covers the spectrum.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_473.wav	4.10	We will now look into its historical background.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_474.wav	3.37	They were impressive against France.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_475.wav	3.42	The chief constable has retired.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_476.wav	3.20	It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_477.wav	3.33	The casting of her husband was an accident.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p247\p247_479.wav	3.46	That was the first time I worked with Richard.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_001.wav	1.92	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_002.wav	4.87	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_003.wav	9.69	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_004.wav	6.06	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_005.wav	8.92	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_006.wav	7.68	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_007.wav	5.89	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_008.wav	9.98	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_009.wav	6.66	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_010.wav	3.80	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_011.wav	9.64	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_012.wav	6.87	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_013.wav	5.89	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_014.wav	6.57	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_015.wav	7.94	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_016.wav	9.13	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_017.wav	4.53	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_018.wav	6.58	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_019.wav	9.09	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_020.wav	4.82	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_021.wav	11.18	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_022.wav	8.07	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_023.wav	13.91	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_024.wav	7.90	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_025.wav	5.04	She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_026.wav	4.44	It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_027.wav	2.09	But it failed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_028.wav	2.99	That's no bad thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_029.wav	4.82	The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_030.wav	2.56	I have a theory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_031.wav	3.97	Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_032.wav	3.97	I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_033.wav	4.82	They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_034.wav	5.68	Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_035.wav	3.84	I expected these kind of questions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_036.wav	2.82	It's a matter of balance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_037.wav	4.86	We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_038.wav	4.44	But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_039.wav	2.22	It was clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_040.wav	4.27	People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_041.wav	3.25	She is believed to be in South Africa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_042.wav	2.52	I was scared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_043.wav	2.52	It was ugly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_044.wav	3.37	That is a break with tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_045.wav	3.59	You must always attempt to raise the bar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_046.wav	3.93	No meaningful response was issued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_047.wav	2.30	It is urgent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_048.wav	5.46	Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_049.wav	4.57	The record companies have gone through the floor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_050.wav	4.86	We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_051.wav	2.74	But it might have done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_052.wav	4.06	In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_053.wav	2.95	He looks like an Afghan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_054.wav	2.73	They had to explain it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_055.wav	2.35	Here's a clue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_056.wav	3.42	But the law is very clear on this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_057.wav	3.63	Next league matches Celtic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_058.wav	2.56	It's very odd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_059.wav	2.44	It will take time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_060.wav	3.89	The problems are a result of that shortfall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_061.wav	4.65	We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_062.wav	3.12	Four other charges were dropped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_063.wav	2.39	It is not great art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_064.wav	5.21	It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_065.wav	3.03	Scotland had great assets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_066.wav	3.59	There will be tough opponents to this report.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_067.wav	5.12	Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_068.wav	3.25	It's good news and long overdue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_069.wav	2.48	Have a look at our accounts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_070.wav	3.76	He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_071.wav	2.05	There was an e-mail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_072.wav	2.61	Then followed a bout of flu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_073.wav	2.09	Neither it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_074.wav	2.35	I had my suspicions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_075.wav	2.31	He got the same story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_076.wav	2.05	It works for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_077.wav	2.09	It is a time bomb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_078.wav	2.61	Today she has been released.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_079.wav	5.21	It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_080.wav	2.43	It may well have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_081.wav	4.19	That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_082.wav	2.86	Nothing is yet confirmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_083.wav	3.63	New Zealand rugby is totally different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_084.wav	2.48	We have other options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_085.wav	3.41	By then, he was walking on water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_086.wav	2.39	It's never too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_087.wav	3.80	Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_088.wav	5.17	Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_089.wav	2.74	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_090.wav	3.89	Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_091.wav	4.82	This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_092.wav	4.40	I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_093.wav	2.14	He was possessed
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_094.wav	5.59	I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_095.wav	5.72	Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_096.wav	3.50	It is a delight on every level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_097.wav	2.65	I had a ball today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_098.wav	2.90	Two of the team became ill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_099.wav	2.69	That's all right then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_100.wav	2.52	That would be unlawful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_101.wav	3.37	That time is not now, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_102.wav	3.16	Oil embargo endorsed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_103.wav	3.07	I didn't play well last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_104.wav	2.56	That is no use.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_105.wav	3.33	That all hope is never lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_106.wav	6.49	Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_107.wav	2.61	He pleaded for caution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_108.wav	3.76	According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_109.wav	3.67	I thought it was a fantastic game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_110.wav	3.03	It had been played at festivals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_111.wav	3.16	We do not expect any surplus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_112.wav	5.00	Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_113.wav	3.54	Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_114.wav	3.03	It's not a new concept in jazz.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_115.wav	4.52	This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_116.wav	4.10	Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_117.wav	2.69	Maybe this battle has been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_118.wav	3.03	But the fans deserve to know!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_119.wav	4.05	Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_120.wav	3.29	They've got to account for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_121.wav	2.77	She's got to say something.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_122.wav	5.25	Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_123.wav	5.59	We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_124.wav	2.78	I can't even get into the A team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_125.wav	3.12	She does not want to speak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_126.wav	3.80	It's terrible that he has died the same way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_127.wav	4.40	So the European elections are extremely important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_128.wav	4.48	Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_129.wav	4.52	Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_130.wav	2.48	I had relied on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_131.wav	4.36	The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_132.wav	2.39	It's the big omission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_133.wav	3.03	It plans to return to this field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_134.wav	2.69	Our intentions are real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_135.wav	2.95	Government will intervene.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_136.wav	3.84	Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_137.wav	4.48	Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_138.wav	5.51	On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_139.wav	2.48	It was typical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_140.wav	3.37	I was the last man to touch the ball.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_141.wav	2.35	He has the edge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_142.wav	4.14	He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_143.wav	2.31	It's a crucial award.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_144.wav	2.18	He is severe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_145.wav	2.65	There is a lack of chemistry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_146.wav	3.16	This film will be totally awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_147.wav	4.70	That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_148.wav	2.78	It is like a football team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_149.wav	3.55	Last month he made his debut in Japan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_150.wav	4.14	It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_151.wav	2.44	It is huge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_152.wav	3.97	The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_153.wav	5.76	The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_154.wav	4.10	It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_155.wav	3.67	They were later discharged from hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_156.wav	3.08	That includes the equipment?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_157.wav	3.84	They should stop the bombing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_158.wav	3.97	That's the name of the game, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_159.wav	4.78	A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_160.wav	5.00	They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_161.wav	3.33	Eight months later, he was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_162.wav	2.65	It has to be now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_163.wav	4.31	It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_164.wav	3.33	I was in the train station overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_165.wav	3.63	We knew we had the goal we wanted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_166.wav	2.82	It's that sort of night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_167.wav	2.77	We have a budget in March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_168.wav	4.91	By then, however, both men were already in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_169.wav	2.52	The post will be unpaid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_170.wav	3.58	Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_171.wav	3.76	Waiting times for these services are too long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_172.wav	3.20	They thought they had found a home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_173.wav	5.08	You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_174.wav	2.78	The jury is still out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_175.wav	2.90	Blair's response was weak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_176.wav	3.97	IT S the real thing, for sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_177.wav	2.26	And I saw the light!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_178.wav	4.27	There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_179.wav	2.61	Tony had arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_180.wav	4.53	I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_181.wav	2.35	The goals were good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_182.wav	2.09	I've been there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_183.wav	2.91	Four policemen were wounded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_184.wav	3.33	They receive a high profile in the media.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_185.wav	2.73	We did everything by the book.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_186.wav	3.55	They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_187.wav	3.24	They need to look after themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_188.wav	3.42	What has caused the demise of singing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_189.wav	3.03	You know the sort of thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_190.wav	2.99	I cannot say too much about them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_191.wav	3.97	It was an odd affair, in many respects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_192.wav	2.57	All options are open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_193.wav	3.63	Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_194.wav	3.76	However, this idea is never developed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_195.wav	2.09	It wasn't to be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_196.wav	4.61	It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_197.wav	2.60	It's the same old story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_198.wav	3.67	It was still there, but right at the end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_199.wav	4.10	There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_200.wav	3.42	The service from the other players was super.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_201.wav	3.93	The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_202.wav	2.48	But she might be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_203.wav	2.35	It's just awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_204.wav	2.52	Today was first class.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_205.wav	2.82	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_206.wav	3.33	We have an election in eight days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_207.wav	2.90	Now, it's all right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_208.wav	3.88	This gives a financial incentive to switch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_209.wav	4.35	The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_210.wav	3.12	HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_211.wav	2.48	He is slightly confused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_212.wav	4.61	The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_213.wav	2.73	Twaddle is a case in point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_214.wav	2.94	It had all been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_215.wav	2.99	In each case they were a goal down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_216.wav	4.14	I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_217.wav	5.12	The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_218.wav	5.08	On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_219.wav	4.65	He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_220.wav	5.04	Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_221.wav	4.74	Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_222.wav	3.33	A career as a doctor is on hold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_223.wav	5.76	I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_224.wav	2.56	It was good fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_225.wav	2.61	I have spoken to the skipper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_226.wav	4.61	It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_227.wav	3.16	The track is currently covered in snow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_228.wav	3.42	But he failed to win the committee's support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_229.wav	3.38	At the time, he was a living legend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_230.wav	2.65	It's the same as Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_231.wav	4.48	Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_232.wav	4.10	Police later said the scheme would end in November.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_233.wav	2.65	It is set in Paris.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_234.wav	2.39	They should come forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_235.wav	3.03	I haven't made the donation yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_236.wav	2.39	It's very safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_237.wav	3.88	It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_238.wav	5.47	On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_239.wav	2.44	It is no surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_240.wav	2.73	My future is in the marathon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_241.wav	3.97	We have a free vote on these things in our party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_242.wav	3.76	I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_243.wav	2.52	She is well balanced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_244.wav	4.69	A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_245.wav	2.22	It is hard won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_246.wav	2.26	The scene is about this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_247.wav	5.04	The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_248.wav	3.97	It's a record label, not a form of music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_249.wav	2.82	It was a cry for help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_250.wav	2.44	It was a hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_251.wav	2.78	This year I understood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_252.wav	4.31	I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_253.wav	4.27	At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_254.wav	2.56	We run within the law.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_255.wav	2.78	Kirkwood was arrested.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_256.wav	2.22	they fail to engage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_257.wav	2.01	They are real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_258.wav	2.91	They must play for each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_259.wav	4.74	However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_260.wav	2.60	It is also very valuable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_261.wav	4.52	An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_262.wav	2.61	That is highly unfair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_263.wav	2.86	He will emerge as a world leader.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_264.wav	3.03	They want to shut the Scottish Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_265.wav	2.73	This is a question of Islam.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_266.wav	3.07	Of course, that is not the whole story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_267.wav	4.69	Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_268.wav	3.20	I am totally horrified by the sentence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_269.wav	2.78	Immediate action must be taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_270.wav	3.16	He is a young man with a new deal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_271.wav	3.16	He was also married with two children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_272.wav	3.25	He's been here on numerous occasions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_273.wav	2.27	It's a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_274.wav	1.96	I feel pretty good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_275.wav	5.08	Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_276.wav	2.86	If not, he should go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_277.wav	2.65	He looked very sharp.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_278.wav	4.40	This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_279.wav	3.12	You've got to have both sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_280.wav	3.84	What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_281.wav	3.67	He will address the nation this evening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_282.wav	2.09	It was a virus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_283.wav	3.37	Maloney is an engaging talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_284.wav	3.59	It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_285.wav	3.89	It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_286.wav	4.31	But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_287.wav	2.48	It is not normal practice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_288.wav	3.03	The release attracted little attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_289.wav	5.72	The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_290.wav	2.65	IT S all in the hair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_291.wav	2.65	What has altered?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_292.wav	3.25	I thought it was my only chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_293.wav	5.00	The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_294.wav	3.12	Our task is to complete the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_295.wav	3.46	Davis is very supportive, as a director.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_296.wav	4.05	We believe the world has too many refugees already.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_297.wav	3.59	We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_298.wav	4.61	In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_299.wav	2.73	SCOTLAND has shown the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_300.wav	3.67	It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_301.wav	4.44	However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_302.wav	3.37	Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_303.wav	3.80	The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_304.wav	3.21	We have waited a long time for this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_305.wav	4.74	and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_306.wav	2.95	It's about my time as a guitarist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_307.wav	1.97	It should be equal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_308.wav	3.16	Craig is a major concern for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_309.wav	5.04	He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_310.wav	5.47	The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_311.wav	2.82	Other people had looked at it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_312.wav	4.01	They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_313.wav	2.48	Off with their heads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_314.wav	3.67	The parents will have a great time, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_315.wav	2.95	Donald was his friend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_316.wav	3.89	I think I was recorded with a video camera.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_317.wav	2.86	He was unable to come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_318.wav	2.48	I saw some good things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_319.wav	3.50	It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_320.wav	3.84	You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_321.wav	4.10	Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_322.wav	3.33	Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_323.wav	1.67	Who will do it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_324.wav	3.54	That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_325.wav	3.59	I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_326.wav	3.16	This is the way things should be handled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_327.wav	2.73	The train was on time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_328.wav	4.87	You were very proud that day to be among their friends.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_329.wav	2.22	He has to learn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_330.wav	2.57	Indeed, it was magical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_331.wav	2.26	There's no place to hide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_332.wav	2.78	It will be very, very tight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_333.wav	2.91	I said that I had been raped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_334.wav	4.74	In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_335.wav	2.73	The composer will conduct.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_336.wav	5.93	This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_337.wav	3.37	Like his acting, it was an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_338.wav	4.52	Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_339.wav	2.91	It's the last thing on my mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_340.wav	4.40	The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_341.wav	2.48	I'd like to take the plunge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_342.wav	5.51	Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_343.wav	2.01	It is horrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_344.wav	3.93	They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_345.wav	2.18	I kept going for her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_346.wav	2.31	Tyson is overwhelmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_347.wav	3.46	In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_348.wav	1.93	But nothing happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_349.wav	3.76	But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_350.wav	3.84	No other job in world football can compare to this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_351.wav	2.52	He seems to be pleased with the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_352.wav	2.44	He has seen the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_353.wav	4.82	To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_354.wav	2.99	It was that bad, that low.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_355.wav	1.67	That would help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_356.wav	3.97	Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_357.wav	2.35	Who was the mystery MP?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_358.wav	4.14	We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_359.wav	3.42	He later became a respected High Court judge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_360.wav	2.86	He could face a jail sentence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_361.wav	4.69	The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_362.wav	3.20	Now, though, he has an incentive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_363.wav	3.67	They have not done so this season so far.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_364.wav	4.27	This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_365.wav	3.33	It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_366.wav	2.18	It is legally binding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_367.wav	2.95	Well, the big day has arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_368.wav	2.65	Five members were disciplined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_369.wav	2.26	There is no signature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_370.wav	2.05	I am a wealthy person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_371.wav	4.91	Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_372.wav	2.99	Colour was at the core of his life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_373.wav	4.19	He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_374.wav	2.48	He's a lovely young man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_375.wav	2.69	The casualties were not named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p248\p248_376.wav	4.23	A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_002.wav	4.06	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_003.wav	7.81	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_004.wav	5.04	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_005.wav	6.74	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_006.wav	6.06	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_007.wav	4.52	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_008.wav	7.30	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_009.wav	4.78	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_010.wav	3.16	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_011.wav	7.04	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_012.wav	4.57	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_013.wav	4.82	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_014.wav	5.42	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_016.wav	6.70	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_017.wav	4.23	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_018.wav	5.12	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_019.wav	7.81	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_020.wav	4.18	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_021.wav	8.83	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_022.wav	7.17	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_023.wav	11.87	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_024.wav	7.64	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_025.wav	4.53	She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_026.wav	4.40	Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_027.wav	2.01	It's nice to hear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_028.wav	2.27	They should be so lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_029.wav	2.27	Because we do not need it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_030.wav	2.18	There's a story, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_031.wav	3.89	Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_032.wav	2.78	He took me on a tour of the wards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_033.wav	3.84	A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_034.wav	3.59	IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_035.wav	4.31	Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_036.wav	1.88	It was clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_037.wav	3.12	It is not for any other purpose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_038.wav	2.61	He did not know his daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_039.wav	2.78	She is believed to be in South Africa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_040.wav	4.40	It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_041.wav	1.84	Sure, it's funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_042.wav	2.27	It's a crucial award.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_043.wav	2.61	The boy is no longer with us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_044.wav	1.75	It's a blessing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_045.wav	2.44	Is a drug dealer?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_046.wav	2.01	As she explains.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_047.wav	2.44	He is too weak to move.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_048.wav	3.76	He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_049.wav	2.52	I would love to have him home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_050.wav	2.26	He looks like an Afghan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_051.wav	3.89	No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_052.wav	2.65	It will come all right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_053.wav	4.44	However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_054.wav	3.08	Next league matches Celtic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_055.wav	2.65	It happens from time to time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_056.wav	2.09	It's very odd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_057.wav	4.35	Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_058.wav	1.75	It is unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_059.wav	1.84	It will take time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_060.wav	1.88	That's the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_061.wav	1.88	Jobs could go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_062.wav	3.42	The problems are a result of that shortfall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_063.wav	3.16	I'm just enjoying every match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_064.wav	2.52	And a film maker was born.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_065.wav	2.95	You did not change overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_066.wav	2.26	There was a battle there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_067.wav	3.12	Scotland had great assets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_068.wav	2.86	I've spent a lot of time on buses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_069.wav	4.36	There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_070.wav	2.39	Have a look at our accounts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_071.wav	3.46	It is like a river running by my home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_072.wav	1.84	Try to save us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_073.wav	3.54	He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_074.wav	2.27	Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_075.wav	2.82	Painful, but only because it's true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_076.wav	3.33	The play is based on a real-life event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_077.wav	2.95	It's very difficult to find a buyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_078.wav	2.61	He highlighted a lack of staff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_079.wav	3.29	They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_080.wav	3.41	Both sides have been hit by injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_081.wav	4.61	The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_082.wav	2.90	It is a job creation scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_083.wav	2.22	Even the one she loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_084.wav	2.39	I've not thought about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_086.wav	3.93	Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_087.wav	3.97	That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_088.wav	2.86	She had kept the news from him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_089.wav	2.82	He seems to be pleased with the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_090.wav	3.76	When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_092.wav	3.76	Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_093.wav	2.56	And rugby fans can help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_094.wav	2.56	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_095.wav	3.89	The city council is a major property owner in the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_096.wav	2.95	Now the system is right behind us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_097.wav	3.71	Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_098.wav	2.22	Today I couldn't run on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_099.wav	2.69	However, it did not end that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_100.wav	2.01	We must look forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_101.wav	2.82	It is an old family habit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_102.wav	4.53	That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_103.wav	2.99	Until you hit the big games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_104.wav	2.09	Then came the crunch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_105.wav	4.48	The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_106.wav	5.04	We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_107.wav	3.50	He is hungry for success and I am the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_108.wav	3.71	The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_109.wav	2.95	It is a good day for the coalition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_110.wav	4.14	A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_111.wav	3.20	We want to get to the final, anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_112.wav	2.27	It is a good lifestyle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_113.wav	4.95	It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_114.wav	4.40	According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_115.wav	2.22	You had better believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_116.wav	3.16	Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_117.wav	2.39	It's a long process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_118.wav	2.31	They were behind the wheel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_119.wav	1.79	It was ugly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_120.wav	3.89	Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_121.wav	4.40	This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_122.wav	2.09	Does this mean.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_123.wav	2.74	They've got to account for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_124.wav	2.26	Who would have?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_125.wav	3.76	The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_126.wav	3.07	You can spend money on housing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_127.wav	2.95	There were no grounds for his action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_128.wav	4.57	It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_129.wav	4.40	His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_130.wav	3.97	It's the traumatic event in the childhood of a nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_131.wav	4.31	Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_132.wav	4.10	Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_133.wav	3.76	She said she could not believe that they had run away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_134.wav	3.97	We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_135.wav	4.44	Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_136.wav	2.73	What will happen then?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_137.wav	4.48	Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_138.wav	3.33	Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_139.wav	2.82	It was very frightened and dirty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_140.wav	2.82	I was the last man to touch the ball.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_141.wav	2.60	It's a question of fashion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_142.wav	1.75	We need to chat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_143.wav	2.78	Wallace was a prisoner of war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_144.wav	1.88	He is severe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_145.wav	2.60	It is difficult for Ali.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_146.wav	2.39	Is that Titanic?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_147.wav	4.61	Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_148.wav	2.01	The idea is simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_149.wav	4.05	That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_150.wav	2.44	It is like a football team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_152.wav	3.03	It is not just about pay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_153.wav	4.44	The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_154.wav	3.33	The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_155.wav	2.61	The weaknesses are few.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_156.wav	3.93	The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_157.wav	3.08	It is not normal practice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_159.wav	2.35	It was by the numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_160.wav	4.48	This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_161.wav	2.35	There's a pause.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_162.wav	2.82	Neither side can win this war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_163.wav	2.31	They should stop the bombing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_164.wav	3.50	Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_165.wav	2.44	These days are long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_166.wav	2.78	It is an attitude of mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_167.wav	3.46	It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_168.wav	4.57	Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_169.wav	4.44	They say that vital evidence was not heard in the court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_170.wav	2.61	I'm so worried about the roads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_171.wav	2.52	We have to move forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_172.wav	2.26	Tell it like it was?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_173.wav	3.54	It is not too late to get on board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_174.wav	3.46	We have a budget in March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_176.wav	5.93	Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_177.wav	6.62	As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_178.wav	4.18	The release attracted little attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_179.wav	2.27	Someone who cares
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_180.wav	4.23	I always felt they played for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_181.wav	4.78	You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_182.wav	2.69	The jury is still out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_183.wav	7.55	But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_184.wav	7.00	However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_185.wav	6.44	It is not either national standards or local control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_186.wav	2.05	It should be easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_187.wav	3.07	Everyone can be bought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_188.wav	4.10	We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_189.wav	3.55	We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_190.wav	6.44	And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_191.wav	1.88	It is not fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_192.wav	3.33	Miller was every bit as happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_193.wav	4.10	We want to help them through it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_194.wav	2.69	I put the drawing down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_196.wav	1.85	I had a train to catch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_197.wav	2.90	It is tough, but possible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_198.wav	5.93	We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_199.wav	4.52	However, this idea is never developed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_200.wav	2.99	Last night was a key episode.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_201.wav	4.57	We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_202.wav	2.99	It is a case of taking a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_203.wav	2.86	I wanted to put myself on the line.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_204.wav	6.36	Sir Paul McCartney said he had been shocked by the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_205.wav	6.70	The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_206.wav	5.00	There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_207.wav	4.70	The service from the other players was super.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_208.wav	6.23	He has a lot of experience as a captain in his career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_209.wav	2.18	I have a cold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_210.wav	5.55	On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_211.wav	2.69	Ferguson should take note.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_212.wav	6.57	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_213.wav	5.59	The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_214.wav	4.78	It's all about money, money, money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_216.wav	4.18	We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_217.wav	3.33	This is a good move for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_218.wav	2.86	But I am a worried man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_219.wav	2.56	There was an e-mail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_220.wav	2.35	Feel the heat?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_221.wav	3.97	We'll have to work hard today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_222.wav	4.48	Twaddle is a case in point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_223.wav	7.08	It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_224.wav	7.21	The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_225.wav	5.21	On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_226.wav	8.71	The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_229.wav	6.96	Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_230.wav	7.68	And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_231.wav	2.05	It is a gamble.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_232.wav	2.60	My neighbours are horrified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_234.wav	2.65	He is in the queue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_235.wav	5.00	Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_236.wav	2.90	Broke the birdie record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_237.wav	5.08	The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_238.wav	2.86	We were a load of rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_239.wav	6.06	Half of young people had had contact with the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_240.wav	3.46	It's a lovely, lovely film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_241.wav	4.44	Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_243.wav	6.70	The problem in Norway is outside the National.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_244.wav	5.51	We have a free vote on these things in our party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_245.wav	7.34	We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_246.wav	7.85	I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_247.wav	2.44	There wasn't a goal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_248.wav	1.96	I was shocked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_249.wav	2.69	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_251.wav	6.66	Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_252.wav	5.51	He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_253.wav	5.72	At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_254.wav	7.09	It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_255.wav	5.89	It is very important that we get the balance right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_256.wav	5.76	It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_257.wav	7.56	One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_258.wav	3.63	They must play for each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_259.wav	5.55	His contract was then not renewed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_260.wav	7.00	He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_261.wav	4.61	That's the only thing I will say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_262.wav	3.03	Blood samples were taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_263.wav	2.99	They are never here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_265.wav	4.95	He has not created a Festival resource.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_266.wav	5.94	He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_267.wav	5.89	Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_268.wav	2.99	It is the same in Sweden.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_269.wav	3.25	And Michael was just great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_270.wav	6.57	It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_271.wav	3.12	It's not even finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_272.wav	4.23	Our objective is to tackle poverty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_273.wav	2.56	Things can change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_274.wav	4.57	She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_275.wav	2.65	People have no choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_276.wav	6.23	Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_277.wav	3.80	He has a wealth of experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_278.wav	6.83	Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_279.wav	4.06	For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_280.wav	3.12	There's nothing I can say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_281.wav	6.87	Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_282.wav	4.27	This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_283.wav	3.67	You've got to have both sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_284.wav	3.97	What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_285.wav	5.94	Motherwell have no such good fortune.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_286.wav	6.92	The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_287.wav	6.36	The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_288.wav	4.06	Scotland were beaten again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_289.wav	5.00	A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_290.wav	5.29	I do not think this family will ever get over this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_291.wav	3.89	These figures are truly awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_292.wav	2.69	He should have won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_293.wav	3.46	Sunday's game was not a trial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_294.wav	3.54	A new school will be built.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_295.wav	4.78	The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_296.wav	7.25	Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_297.wav	2.99	What has altered?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_298.wav	4.48	However, the snow was welcomed by some.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_299.wav	6.79	He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_300.wav	3.89	Our task is to complete the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_301.wav	8.37	A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_302.wav	2.09	They are wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_303.wav	6.53	Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_304.wav	4.39	The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_305.wav	7.30	Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_306.wav	4.06	They were on holiday in Egypt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_307.wav	7.00	I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_308.wav	2.73	And he goes with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_309.wav	6.70	It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_310.wav	6.62	However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_311.wav	6.06	A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_312.wav	6.45	I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_313.wav	3.76	Is there on his hands?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_314.wav	3.50	Special measures were needed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_315.wav	2.43	They were fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_316.wav	4.57	In fact, they have the opposite effect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_317.wav	3.20	They wanted the club to make money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_318.wav	4.48	The problems began a long time ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_319.wav	3.20	Referees are easy targets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_320.wav	4.87	Davis is very supportive, as a director.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_321.wav	3.84	I came into this world with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_322.wav	2.91	That's the law of the land.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_323.wav	2.52	There was no time scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_324.wav	2.22	I am so upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_326.wav	2.86	It could have gone either way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_327.wav	3.29	He was then replaced by Ross.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_328.wav	3.25	My view has now completely changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_329.wav	4.57	In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_330.wav	5.93	Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_331.wav	4.48	The same things will happen with GM foods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_332.wav	2.35	Who will do it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_335.wav	2.73	I must make that clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_336.wav	2.99	The train was on time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_337.wav	4.69	A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_338.wav	7.00	The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_339.wav	4.70	That is the very reason why it was so vital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_340.wav	5.89	In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_341.wav	5.34	I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_342.wav	2.09	He's a genius.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_343.wav	4.10	They should take their mobile phones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_344.wav	5.51	From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_345.wav	3.76	Eight months later, he was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_347.wav	5.08	It's all going to clear the debt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_348.wav	5.04	He had played well in that central role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_349.wav	4.01	The decision is an absolute disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_350.wav	2.30	It is horrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_351.wav	2.31	It was very formal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_352.wav	5.42	Both of those promises have already been honoured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_353.wav	2.86	I kept going for her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p249\p249_354.wav	5.80	In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_001.wav	2.39	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_002.wav	3.42	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_003.wav	6.58	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_004.wav	4.27	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_005.wav	6.36	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_006.wav	5.85	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_007.wav	4.53	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_008.wav	6.57	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_009.wav	4.70	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_010.wav	2.56	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_011.wav	6.40	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_012.wav	3.89	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_013.wav	3.63	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_014.wav	4.40	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_015.wav	5.04	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_016.wav	5.72	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_017.wav	3.37	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_018.wav	5.08	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_019.wav	6.83	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_020.wav	3.93	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_021.wav	8.28	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_022.wav	7.60	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_023.wav	10.12	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_024.wav	6.02	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_025.wav	3.12	A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_026.wav	2.39	Meetings will also remain private.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_027.wav	2.56	I am pretty careful with money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_028.wav	2.48	Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_030.wav	2.18	This is a central issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_031.wav	2.30	We will not tolerate it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_032.wav	3.03	Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_033.wav	2.13	He works at the airport.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_034.wav	2.27	Smoking is also very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_035.wav	3.12	Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_036.wav	2.48	It was just appalling luck.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_037.wav	2.52	Rugby has an extended run.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_038.wav	3.76	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_039.wav	2.57	Costs have got to be controlled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_040.wav	2.82	You must always attempt to raise the bar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_042.wav	2.78	No meaningful response was issued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_043.wav	2.57	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_044.wav	1.84	I made a terrible start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_045.wav	2.35	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_046.wav	1.75	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_047.wav	2.23	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_048.wav	1.79	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_049.wav	2.90	It comes from reflection or thinking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_050.wav	3.89	Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_051.wav	2.78	Strikers like to go to the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_052.wav	3.29	Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_053.wav	2.74	Pulled a huge number of viewers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_054.wav	2.39	I had trouble with the producers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_055.wav	2.22	The teacher would have approved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_056.wav	2.65	The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_057.wav	2.43	I expect a rapid response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_058.wav	2.35	She said she was really sorry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_059.wav	3.16	The problems are a result of that shortfall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_060.wav	2.14	There's still plenty time left.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_061.wav	1.88	Let's hope that it does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_062.wav	2.35	We have to keep our clients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_063.wav	3.93	The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_064.wav	2.82	Companies are now seeking to recover their losses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_065.wav	2.22	This is the first step.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_066.wav	2.05	We will pay their bills.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_067.wav	2.78	We are talking about the outskirts of London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_068.wav	2.31	The Farmer wants a new campaign.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_069.wav	2.30	Only water is currently allowed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_070.wav	2.69	I am about protecting the state pension.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_071.wav	3.03	He later became a respected High Court judge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_072.wav	2.78	Robin Williams is very subdued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_073.wav	2.26	It wasn't possible to relax.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_074.wav	2.65	We need to increase the membership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_075.wav	2.31	There's nothing they can get on me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_076.wav	2.30	I was as strong as a horse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_077.wav	1.88	He was a lovely man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_078.wav	2.35	Both sides have been hit by injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_079.wav	2.61	We had a court hearing in London yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_080.wav	3.03	After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_081.wav	2.31	It makes for an interesting conference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_082.wav	2.31	I've had it for the exams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_083.wav	2.94	This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_084.wav	3.03	The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_085.wav	3.42	They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_086.wav	2.61	He put some colour into Scottish history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_087.wav	1.92	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_088.wav	2.26	Potions said he would drive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_089.wav	3.93	I think the industry needs a big idea to rebuild confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_090.wav	2.95	William Hague, the guest of honour, was delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_091.wav	2.95	We are progressing with a few interested parties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_092.wav	3.12	That view is held by many others within the industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_093.wav	2.78	The excitement could hardly be contained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_094.wav	4.91	The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_095.wav	2.35	It is high time to act.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_096.wav	1.92	Why do it otherwise ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_097.wav	2.60	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_098.wav	2.31	So, did she meet him ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_099.wav	2.48	So what is the campaign about ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_100.wav	1.24	And does it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_101.wav	1.88	Are you from the rugby ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_102.wav	1.88	Had I heard ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_103.wav	2.48	It is an old family habit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_104.wav	3.37	The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_105.wav	2.10	He was released after treatment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_106.wav	2.30	We have made no final decisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_107.wav	3.20	The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_108.wav	2.27	We knew they could do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_109.wav	2.99	The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_110.wav	2.13	They must be on commission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_111.wav	3.38	He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_113.wav	2.99	Mr Wilson has received no such request.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_114.wav	3.29	Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_115.wav	2.01	It's good to have a voice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_116.wav	1.71	He was prepared for this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_117.wav	4.06	However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_118.wav	2.69	The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_119.wav	2.22	No, the equipment is extra.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_120.wav	2.35	It didn't come as any great surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_121.wav	3.12	Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_123.wav	2.65	It has been a nightmare of frustration.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_124.wav	2.31	Before the game we went for a pint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_125.wav	2.65	I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_126.wav	2.69	While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_127.wav	2.43	I understand the medical concerns.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_128.wav	2.52	That's not an assumption that I had made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_129.wav	2.44	I have learned from him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_130.wav	3.16	The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_131.wav	2.26	He thought she was amazing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_132.wav	2.65	Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_133.wav	4.18	This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_134.wav	1.97	It isn't a happy memory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_135.wav	2.22	We have a team to reach the final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_136.wav	2.10	Failure is not an option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_137.wav	1.97	She's got to say something.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_138.wav	3.37	He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_139.wav	2.48	This is a frightening development.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_140.wav	2.86	It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_141.wav	3.59	That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_142.wav	2.48	That is far too high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_143.wav	2.31	My life has changed a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_144.wav	2.18	We did what we had to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_146.wav	2.22	You've got to be vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_147.wav	2.09	You are a gambling man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_148.wav	2.35	I had decided to quit the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_149.wav	3.29	Losing in that manner is very hard to take.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_150.wav	2.82	It was finally agreed on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_151.wav	2.90	I love the spectacle of cinema.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_152.wav	2.48	We will try to find someone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_153.wav	2.05	She died at her home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_154.wav	2.09	What happened in that game ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_155.wav	1.84	Are you going to win ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_156.wav	1.50	Was it the wife ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_157.wav	1.62	Why change it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_158.wav	2.52	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_159.wav	2.78	Frankly, it was worth the booking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_160.wav	2.22	He was pleased with his display.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_161.wav	2.30	Life is still very tough for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_162.wav	2.44	It is not just about pay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_163.wav	2.48	It opens the door to the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_164.wav	2.73	Anyway, the job will be part-time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_165.wav	2.10	It has become a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_166.wav	2.69	The whole industry is a shambles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_167.wav	2.48	People were actually not on his side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_168.wav	2.52	The defender made an impressive debut.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_169.wav	2.35	There's only one team in Ayrshire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_170.wav	2.60	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_171.wav	2.05	They have not been named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_172.wav	4.05	The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_173.wav	4.78	Yesterday Abbey National said it had injected further capital into Scottish Provident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_174.wav	3.12	The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_175.wav	1.92	He was asked to quit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_176.wav	2.94	This action reflects a slump in bookings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_177.wav	3.07	Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_178.wav	2.35	I'd love to be like Peter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_179.wav	2.09	You will be very welcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_180.wav	3.24	It had so much to do with output.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_181.wav	2.52	That would open the gates of hell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_182.wav	2.86	Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_183.wav	3.33	The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_184.wav	2.27	They could not match it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_185.wav	3.21	First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_186.wav	2.69	But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_187.wav	3.07	This championship is different from the other majors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_188.wav	2.99	I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_189.wav	2.65	It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_190.wav	3.24	The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_191.wav	2.73	Our fans have been marvellous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_192.wav	3.12	This could be an amazing attraction for Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_193.wav	2.43	They need to look after themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_194.wav	2.22	Miller was every bit as happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_195.wav	2.26	They were seriously after him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_196.wav	2.39	It was a bit like having children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_197.wav	2.18	Aberdeen had little to offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_198.wav	3.03	We represent a wide range of society.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_199.wav	2.65	He was rejected because he had retired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_200.wav	2.09	We always felt we could win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_201.wav	2.22	It may have been a cry for help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_202.wav	3.46	This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_204.wav	2.39	We are going through difficult times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_205.wav	2.39	We've had an enjoyable adventure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_206.wav	2.78	For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_207.wav	2.01	You could feel the heat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_208.wav	3.29	We have to be happy with a British and European record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_209.wav	2.13	It was a moment of madness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_210.wav	2.09	And we have the experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_211.wav	3.63	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_212.wav	2.05	It gave no further details.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_214.wav	2.18	I won't make an official complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_215.wav	3.48	British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_216.wav	2.56	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_217.wav	2.69	The move follows a review of the Singapore
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_218.wav	1.92	It carried a double message.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_219.wav	3.50	Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_220.wav	2.73	This gives a financial incentive to switch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_221.wav	2.18	That might help a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_222.wav	1.71	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_223.wav	1.84	how do you get it back ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_224.wav	2.14	What are you not good at ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_225.wav	1.79	I think, therefore I am ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_226.wav	2.01	Who was she ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_227.wav	2.65	Harry Potter has lost his magic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_228.wav	2.95	Today we must not repeat that mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_229.wav	2.18	It had all been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_230.wav	2.14	My daughter is an adult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_231.wav	2.39	His third goal was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_232.wav	2.04	It will affect their work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_233.wav	2.95	Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_234.wav	2.95	I am considered a teenager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_235.wav	2.26	The process will start tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_236.wav	1.97	It's just a normal life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_237.wav	2.31	The transaction is not feasible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_238.wav	2.65	I wouldn't even respond to that question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_239.wav	1.84	It is good for our team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_240.wav	3.46	Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_241.wav	2.18	That you can do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_242.wav	2.82	It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_243.wav	2.52	A career as a doctor is on hold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_244.wav	3.33	During the communist time they were very privileged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_245.wav	3.33	They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_246.wav	2.69	His background is firmly in venture capital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_247.wav	3.46	The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_248.wav	2.05	I have spoken to the skipper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_249.wav	3.12	A small number of new jobs will also be created.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_250.wav	2.14	She will attend in July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_251.wav	4.14	They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_252.wav	2.69	The most important thing is the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_253.wav	3.08	There is no timetable for completing such inquiries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_254.wav	2.60	Paterson can afford to be generous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_255.wav	2.43	The right decision has been made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_257.wav	2.95	Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_258.wav	3.37	Customers would then be consulted over any changes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_260.wav	3.59	Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_261.wav	2.31	He was good, but not that good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_262.wav	2.61	At half-time he was presented to both teams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_263.wav	3.63	He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_264.wav	2.31	He is a reporter for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_265.wav	2.90	We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_266.wav	3.12	Either way, the investor retains the premium.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_267.wav	2.69	We've had several problems over injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_268.wav	2.56	That was a disgraceful performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_269.wav	3.20	Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_270.wav	2.35	It was a kind of contempt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_271.wav	2.94	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_272.wav	2.09	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_273.wav	3.03	There will be widespread support on all sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_274.wav	2.78	Messages have to be reinforced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_275.wav	1.88	I got a yellow card.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_276.wav	2.65	This is no reflection on Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_277.wav	2.44	We accept the new rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_278.wav	2.94	They are interior designers and architects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_280.wav	3.07	I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_281.wav	3.46	Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_282.wav	2.18	We are aiming for early March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_283.wav	1.96	I felt about this big.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_284.wav	2.56	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_285.wav	2.05	was everything done to save people ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_286.wav	2.65	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_287.wav	2.22	Do I think about them often ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_288.wav	2.13	Is it in the right place ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_289.wav	2.60	It is also very valuable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_290.wav	2.82	I feel really confident in that department.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_291.wav	2.78	This could put pressure on UK inflation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_292.wav	3.09	Companies have only recently been allowed to compete on price.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_293.wav	3.63	The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_294.wav	2.52	I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_295.wav	2.48	We shall rely on human beings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_296.wav	2.99	It has the potential to be another North Sea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_297.wav	3.80	We would have no control over the threshold for repayment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_298.wav	2.73	He has not created a Festival resource.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_299.wav	3.46	Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_300.wav	2.73	I understand the security issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_301.wav	2.82	Frankly, we should all have such problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_302.wav	2.35	It was an easy decision to come here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_304.wav	3.25	He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_305.wav	3.37	Funding would come from both Scotland and Northern Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_306.wav	2.26	No-one wanted to run it tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_308.wav	4.06	We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_309.wav	2.35	She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_310.wav	2.39	You have to expect this type of thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_311.wav	2.18	Stephen will get his first cap.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_312.wav	3.67	However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_313.wav	3.12	There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_314.wav	2.69	The circumstances have changed since last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_315.wav	2.39	It's all designed to speed up the service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_316.wav	2.22	I wanted to change the formula.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_317.wav	2.44	He will address the nation this evening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_318.wav	2.56	I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_319.wav	3.16	Motherwell have no such good fortune.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_320.wav	3.12	We would hope to make progress on that next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_321.wav	2.90	Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_322.wav	2.43	The effect was almost magical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_323.wav	3.12	And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_324.wav	2.14	Holland won by five wickets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_325.wav	2.48	There's still no-one like him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_326.wav	2.82	McNaughton was not so sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_327.wav	2.99	I was brought up in a mining background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_328.wav	3.20	I thought his speech was a disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_329.wav	2.35	The takeover comes as no surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_330.wav	2.48	Job losses were also announced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_331.wav	4.18	A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_332.wav	2.82	We believe the world has too many refugees already.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_333.wav	2.26	The party lasted all night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_334.wav	3.20	Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_335.wav	2.56	It was nice to finish in style.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_336.wav	2.99	They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_337.wav	3.20	Completion of the purchase is seen by the end of the year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_338.wav	1.92	And he goes with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_339.wav	1.92	SCOTLAND has shown the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_340.wav	2.48	There will be good prospects ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_341.wav	2.82	Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_342.wav	2.44	The letters are going out today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_343.wav	3.29	I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_344.wav	2.48	We will listen to any suggestion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_345.wav	2.52	The Premier League has been a huge success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_346.wav	2.18	He has made his base in Spain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_348.wav	2.27	A Home Office spokesman said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_349.wav	3.25	Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_350.wav	2.78	That is a trend which will be encouraged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_351.wav	2.69	It was tough to contain the excitement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_352.wav	2.56	The pain is still acute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_353.wav	4.01	Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_354.wav	2.05	It's wonderful to have won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_355.wav	3.54	Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_356.wav	2.01	I'd like to take the plunge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_357.wav	2.65	Finally came the moment of truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_358.wav	2.18	We have very limited capacity.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_359.wav	2.48	Is our children learning ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_360.wav	2.05	What form did that take ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_361.wav	1.49	Are they free ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_362.wav	2.14	Is there a waiting list ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_363.wav	4.65	In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_364.wav	2.52	Three years ago he would have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_365.wav	3.41	It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_366.wav	2.52	Look at the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_367.wav	3.33	The Allies intend to maintain the average.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_368.wav	2.60	We put our bid in last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_369.wav	2.56	He had no access to the database.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_370.wav	2.69	We're still the only ones in the High Street.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_371.wav	2.35	I was delighted to accept.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_372.wav	2.99	They should take their mobile phones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_374.wav	2.31	It's fantastic to win again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_375.wav	2.52	We are really good friends.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_376.wav	2.56	The salary changes are long overdue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_377.wav	2.78	Those people must be accountable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_378.wav	2.10	She said they would appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_379.wav	2.56	The countryside is in crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_380.wav	1.84	There is no deal as yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_381.wav	2.39	It's as wide as a church in here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_382.wav	2.73	She is obviously very disappointed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_383.wav	3.29	In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_384.wav	2.14	They will fight for everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_385.wav	2.14	We will win the argument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_386.wav	1.41	Is it worth it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_387.wav	1.54	Does it matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_388.wav	2.52	How do you take them away ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_389.wav	2.90	However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_390.wav	2.35	After the match, do you ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_391.wav	2.18	The team hadn't been picked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_392.wav	3.54	No other job in world football can compare to this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_393.wav	2.56	One-third of the places are already taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_394.wav	2.18	I always knew she was funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_395.wav	2.56	Everyone could see the joke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_396.wav	2.22	The marshall at the turn was great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_397.wav	2.90	There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_398.wav	2.95	He has earned the right to their respect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_399.wav	2.44	The law would appear to be on our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_400.wav	2.44	There was a substantial explosion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_401.wav	3.24	The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_402.wav	2.18	Theatre is not a museum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_403.wav	3.89	The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_404.wav	2.14	It has only been rumours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_405.wav	2.65	I was conceived in Aberdeen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_406.wav	2.09	Rugby is a hard game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_407.wav	2.90	My immune system had been depleted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_408.wav	3.07	Offence to the herd was not easily overlooked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_409.wav	3.20	This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_410.wav	2.82	Growth will come later in the cycle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_411.wav	2.39	We're not taking any risks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_412.wav	2.39	Neither man has been charged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_413.wav	1.97	I had a fortunate war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_414.wav	2.73	The choice is strictly personal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_415.wav	1.84	It's too close to call.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_416.wav	2.52	The breakdown was much later in her life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_417.wav	2.39	It became a national network.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_418.wav	2.13	It is a large number.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_419.wav	2.26	She started to put on weight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_420.wav	4.01	I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_421.wav	2.52	I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_422.wav	2.99	The BBC was a disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_423.wav	2.18	Russell is delighted with them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_424.wav	2.31	The next few months will tell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_425.wav	3.58	It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_426.wav	2.44	The second goal was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_427.wav	2.05	I am astonished at attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_428.wav	2.48	There is a solution, she believes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_429.wav	2.43	That was the agreement with the manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_430.wav	2.82	He's had to suffer for the last six years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_431.wav	3.76	His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_432.wav	2.99	Being captain of this club is fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_433.wav	3.08	First Minister Donald Dewar will respond.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_434.wav	3.76	The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_435.wav	2.78	No date has been fixed for his return.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_436.wav	3.37	Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_437.wav	2.22	The trial will open today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_438.wav	4.99	National Farmer's Union of Scotland president, Jim Walker, welcomed the new proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_439.wav	2.82	I never won a penny throughout my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_440.wav	2.65	THIS is a good day for Scottish farming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_441.wav	2.73	There were a lot of emotions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_442.wav	3.67	We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_443.wav	3.29	However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_444.wav	2.39	We know about the crisis in cattle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_445.wav	2.52	Everything in golf is a balance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_446.wav	4.82	Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_447.wav	3.71	External auditors will monitor the action which is planned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_448.wav	2.61	The people around me were fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_449.wav	1.96	That will be best for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_450.wav	1.75	And we might go back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_451.wav	3.24	The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_452.wav	3.03	The villagers were shot in the head at short range.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_453.wav	3.16	But you can go beyond that condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_454.wav	2.95	The removal would take place in France.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_455.wav	2.48	It is a tough game but we have a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_456.wav	3.25	But we have built a platform for next season.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_457.wav	2.39	I think the goalkeeper should have gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_458.wav	2.86	They had learned from the lessons of the first game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_459.wav	1.96	The jury is still out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_460.wav	2.14	It was like someone had died.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_461.wav	2.44	The budget was too low for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_462.wav	3.89	Neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner-up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_463.wav	2.78	Striking the deal has come as a big relief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_464.wav	2.09	The damage is all inside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_465.wav	2.52	Let that be their memorial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_466.wav	2.52	The boys are mentally focused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_467.wav	2.77	This is the stuff of live music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_468.wav	3.67	It may prove to be his last involvement with the club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_469.wav	2.99	The move is considered a major breakthrough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_471.wav	2.95	I see no reason to have this debate at this time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_472.wav	2.14	He certainly did a good job!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_473.wav	3.50	Talks between directors have been underway since last month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_474.wav	2.35	I am certainly thinking about retirement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_475.wav	4.87	At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_476.wav	2.61	I have always believed in myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_477.wav	2.77	The chief constable has retired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_478.wav	2.18	Well, he is an artist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_479.wav	3.33	Her body was found about four miles from the car.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_480.wav	2.94	The casting of her husband was an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_481.wav	3.12	Their coach is obviously under a lot of pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_482.wav	2.52	That was the first time I worked with Richard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_483.wav	2.14	That argument has been won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_484.wav	1.96	It was a narrow escape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_485.wav	2.01	And rugby fans can help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_486.wav	2.78	He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_487.wav	2.60	The processing plant was closed yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_488.wav	2.74	The Israeli military denied the claim.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_489.wav	2.09	He is not a dancer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_490.wav	2.77	I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_491.wav	3.29	IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_492.wav	2.77	These people attack the core of my beliefs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_493.wav	2.99	The striker needed attention before he could resume.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_494.wav	2.95	I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_495.wav	3.16	We would welcome a commercial partner or partners.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p250\p250_496.wav	3.07	Subsidy income will not be affected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_001.wav	3.07	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_002.wav	4.44	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_003.wav	7.77	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_004.wav	5.08	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_005.wav	6.62	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_006.wav	5.85	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_007.wav	4.31	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_008.wav	7.55	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_009.wav	4.99	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_010.wav	3.54	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_011.wav	6.66	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_012.wav	4.65	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_013.wav	5.16	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_014.wav	5.68	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_015.wav	5.64	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_016.wav	7.34	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_017.wav	4.14	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_018.wav	5.80	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_019.wav	7.30	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_020.wav	5.00	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_021.wav	9.09	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_022.wav	6.53	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_023.wav	11.74	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_024.wav	8.24	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_025.wav	2.69	Johnson was pretty low.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_026.wav	5.12	But it failed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_027.wav	5.17	That's no bad thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_028.wav	4.53	People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_029.wav	3.58	However, the following year the cancer returned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_030.wav	4.19	So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_032.wav	2.86	It's a matter of balance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_033.wav	1.71	Peace was won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_034.wav	4.87	Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_035.wav	5.80	They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_036.wav	2.39	Was it worth it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_037.wav	4.48	At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_038.wav	3.72	However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_039.wav	3.42	In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_040.wav	2.18	It was clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_041.wav	2.26	They may be wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_042.wav	4.19	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_043.wav	2.69	Dancing was her life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_044.wav	1.88	We will push.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_045.wav	2.48	I feel pretty good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_046.wav	2.05	That should do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_047.wav	3.16	Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_048.wav	2.39	As she explains.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_049.wav	4.44	Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_050.wav	2.73	It is the whole package.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_051.wav	2.44	He had no enemies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_052.wav	4.95	I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_053.wav	3.59	We were surprised to see the photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_054.wav	2.82	I had relied on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_055.wav	2.94	This is a step backwards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_056.wav	4.57	Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_057.wav	2.74	What was the main difference?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_058.wav	2.90	Four other charges were dropped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_059.wav	2.35	It's a real challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_060.wav	2.22	It is not great art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_061.wav	2.69	They're appalled by that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_062.wav	2.43	It's that kind of place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_063.wav	3.29	It was all in a short period of time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_064.wav	4.52	An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_065.wav	3.08	And if he hadn't become a musician?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_066.wav	2.18	He was popular.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_067.wav	3.97	He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_068.wav	2.99	That was the easy election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_069.wav	2.95	There could be a way back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_070.wav	3.76	They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_071.wav	3.01	IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_072.wav	2.35	It was chaotic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_073.wav	2.48	It is a time bomb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_074.wav	2.99	I've not thought about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_075.wav	2.52	Today she has been released.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_076.wav	4.65	It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_077.wav	4.31	That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_078.wav	2.09	I was too young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_079.wav	3.97	The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_080.wav	4.40	It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_081.wav	2.94	War is not the action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_082.wav	2.44	You will be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_083.wav	3.67	Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_084.wav	3.50	Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_085.wav	2.65	We have turned the corner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_087.wav	3.42	Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_088.wav	4.48	They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_089.wav	2.48	We must look forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_090.wav	3.03	It is an old family habit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_091.wav	2.77	Until you hit the big games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_092.wav	4.69	Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_093.wav	3.76	The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_094.wav	2.35	If you could find it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_095.wav	4.53	Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_096.wav	2.52	Journalists should make him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_097.wav	2.69	They were outside the circle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_098.wav	2.95	Two of the team became ill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_099.wav	2.56	That would be unlawful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_100.wav	3.33	No date has been set for the appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_101.wav	3.20	It is a good lifestyle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_102.wav	2.26	That is no use.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_103.wav	3.08	They had to be cut from the wreckage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_104.wav	2.60	Further protests are likely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_105.wav	2.99	I was fighting for my life, I thought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_106.wav	2.35	He was jailed for a year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_107.wav	2.73	It had been played at festivals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_108.wav	2.05	I came to complete.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_109.wav	2.26	You had better believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_110.wav	1.84	I was angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_111.wav	2.86	The fire was above the hole.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_112.wav	3.63	This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_113.wav	4.57	We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_114.wav	4.53	It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_115.wav	2.95	Maybe this battle has been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_116.wav	2.48	I joined a group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_117.wav	2.14	Does this mean.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_118.wav	1.97	It is rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_119.wav	4.14	This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_120.wav	2.56	We work on the same level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_121.wav	4.70	We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_122.wav	2.26	She has been shot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_123.wav	2.18	I'm so angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_124.wav	3.41	It's terrible that he has died the same way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_125.wav	3.84	Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_126.wav	3.63	Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_127.wav	3.63	Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_128.wav	2.86	Well, you can have a tree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_129.wav	3.29	It was the same at Twickenham.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_130.wav	2.39	We had a reunion last week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_131.wav	3.03	If not, a deal could take many months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_132.wav	2.69	Government will intervene.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_133.wav	4.70	Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_134.wav	4.70	Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_135.wav	3.33	Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_136.wav	3.25	Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_137.wav	4.87	We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_138.wav	1.93	Is that it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_139.wav	3.08	I had decided to quit the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_140.wav	3.20	I am totally devoted to this job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_141.wav	2.57	Three penalties were given.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_142.wav	4.61	And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_143.wav	2.69	We just had a go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_144.wav	2.99	We have seen a copy of the report.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_145.wav	2.86	The songs are just so good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_146.wav	2.44	It is like a football team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_147.wav	2.99	That group reported just before Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_148.wav	4.69	He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_149.wav	2.10	You know the type.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_150.wav	4.48	The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_151.wav	4.65	But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_152.wav	2.60	He seemed to lose his focus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_153.wav	2.78	It is not normal practice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_154.wav	3.37	There's a sense of excess in the novel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_155.wav	2.35	I knew he was good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_156.wav	2.09	I saw one body.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_157.wav	2.14	There's a pause.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_158.wav	2.73	Neither side can win this war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_159.wav	2.99	Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_160.wav	3.85	I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_161.wav	2.86	Eight months later, he was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_162.wav	2.82	We have to move forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_163.wav	4.61	However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_164.wav	2.56	Tell it like it was?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_165.wav	4.91	It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_166.wav	4.14	By then, however, both men were already in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_167.wav	2.73	You are not going in blind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_168.wav	2.78	The post will be unpaid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_169.wav	3.71	Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_170.wav	3.29	They thought they had found a home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_171.wav	2.61	I always felt they played for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_172.wav	4.19	Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_173.wav	2.65	One season, they might do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_174.wav	2.74	The jury is still out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_175.wav	3.67	We wanted it left for a wee while.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_176.wav	3.80	It is not either national standards or local control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_177.wav	4.53	The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_178.wav	3.16	We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_179.wav	4.44	I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_180.wav	3.50	We knew nothing about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_181.wav	4.53	Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_182.wav	2.78	Four policemen were wounded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_183.wav	2.43	We did everything by the book.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_184.wav	3.84	What has caused the demise of singing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_185.wav	2.73	We want to help them through it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_186.wav	2.69	I cannot say too much about them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_187.wav	3.55	It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_188.wav	3.16	Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_189.wav	2.52	People will ask about us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_190.wav	2.82	However, this idea is never developed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_191.wav	3.20	Last night was a key episode.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_192.wav	4.10	We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_193.wav	4.31	The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_194.wav	4.23	Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_195.wav	2.95	It is a case of taking a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_196.wav	4.10	It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_197.wav	2.30	It wasn't to be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_198.wav	2.09	It was typical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_199.wav	2.73	It's the same old story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_200.wav	4.52	The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_201.wav	4.65	It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_202.wav	2.52	There was no option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_203.wav	2.69	The conference is the first test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_204.wav	2.52	I saw some terrible things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_205.wav	3.07	They've got three-quarters of the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_206.wav	2.69	A deadline is still essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_207.wav	3.50	I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_208.wav	3.84	We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_209.wav	2.44	Today was first class.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_210.wav	4.95	Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_211.wav	3.63	We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_212.wav	3.21	We have an election in eight days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_213.wav	2.26	Now, it's all right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_214.wav	2.27	There was an e-mail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_215.wav	5.17	Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_216.wav	2.90	Twaddle is a case in point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_217.wav	2.35	I began to pray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_218.wav	3.50	A Grampian Police spokesman said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_219.wav	2.65	We have got to get it right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_220.wav	3.76	The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_221.wav	4.91	A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_222.wav	2.48	Work has started.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_223.wav	4.70	For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_224.wav	2.65	It's just a place to open it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_225.wav	4.35	Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_226.wav	3.50	The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_227.wav	2.91	IT S the real thing, for sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_228.wav	3.50	Women were mostly notable by their absence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_230.wav	4.10	At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_231.wav	2.39	We played them off the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_232.wav	2.39	If it doesn't, it doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_233.wav	3.41	It's a question of creating a future awareness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_234.wav	2.69	I am immensely sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_235.wav	2.56	I'd never seen a play about me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_236.wav	2.09	It is a gamble.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_237.wav	2.95	But he failed to win the committee's support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_238.wav	4.61	Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_239.wav	2.77	We were awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_240.wav	3.67	However, no further action was taken by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_241.wav	3.80	Police later said the scheme would end in November.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_242.wav	2.27	They had no children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_243.wav	2.48	It is set in Paris.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_244.wav	2.52	They should come forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_245.wav	2.22	It's quite a line-up!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_246.wav	3.38	I think a move would create a lot of interest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_247.wav	4.06	It would still have been a good film, but very different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_248.wav	4.53	The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_249.wav	3.29	Of further privacy, he had no need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_250.wav	3.20	My future is in the marathon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_251.wav	4.65	The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_252.wav	3.72	We have a free vote on these things in our party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_253.wav	3.88	He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_254.wav	4.40	The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_255.wav	2.18	It is hard won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_256.wav	3.97	We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_257.wav	3.33	Chambers said he would accept the place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_258.wav	4.10	Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_259.wav	2.86	They tried to give her advice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_260.wav	2.56	His body was never found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_262.wav	2.56	He's a lovely young man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_263.wav	1.88	It was a hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_264.wav	1.71	We are ready.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_265.wav	2.52	They know no other way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_266.wav	4.01	I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_267.wav	2.44	We run within the law.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_268.wav	3.72	They are interior designers and architects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_269.wav	2.65	Kirkwood was arrested.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_270.wav	2.48	they fail to engage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_271.wav	4.35	One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_272.wav	3.67	So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_273.wav	2.86	I was happily surprised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_274.wav	3.20	Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_275.wav	2.14	I am very angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_276.wav	3.46	Today we can say that a new era has begun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_278.wav	4.18	This court has made an order which has not been observed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_279.wav	4.18	Rehearsals will start in the new year for the extended season.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_280.wav	3.42	He thought he had a month to cross the street.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_281.wav	4.27	Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_282.wav	2.86	That's the only thing I will say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_283.wav	3.63	That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_284.wav	4.61	It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_285.wav	4.18	The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_286.wav	3.63	He has not created a Festival resource.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_287.wav	4.91	Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_288.wav	5.59	Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_289.wav	4.74	We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_290.wav	4.57	It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_291.wav	2.90	We're in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_292.wav	3.03	Our objective is to tackle poverty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_293.wav	3.21	One knows the feeling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_294.wav	2.09	Things can change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_295.wav	2.73	It's a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_296.wav	4.27	A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_297.wav	2.86	I am an estate agent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_298.wav	2.82	People have no choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_299.wav	2.22	She looked so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_300.wav	4.95	It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_301.wav	3.46	Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_302.wav	4.06	There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_303.wav	4.44	Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_304.wav	3.03	You've got to have both sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_305.wav	3.37	What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_306.wav	2.09	Who will perform?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_307.wav	2.99	This is a national crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_308.wav	2.91	Scotland were beaten again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_309.wav	2.99	Who did the recruiting?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_310.wav	4.19	She said she could not believe that they had run away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_311.wav	3.33	For the moment, our position remains the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_312.wav	3.08	The results are sometimes contentious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_313.wav	3.03	These figures are truly awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_314.wav	4.74	But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_315.wav	2.99	A new school will be built.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_316.wav	3.25	Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_317.wav	3.33	We have to sort it out ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_318.wav	2.74	He said she was mad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_319.wav	8.79	He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_320.wav	3.93	Our task is to complete the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_321.wav	4.48	Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_322.wav	3.67	We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_323.wav	4.35	It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_324.wav	2.10	You are the glory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_325.wav	2.48	The letters are going out today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_326.wav	3.59	In fact, they have the opposite effect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_327.wav	2.48	We are a peaceful people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_328.wav	4.23	Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_329.wav	4.61	It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_330.wav	2.39	It is out there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_331.wav	2.31	They had a confession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_332.wav	3.20	However, the groups denied the claims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_333.wav	3.12	That is a trend which will be encouraged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_334.wav	2.48	That's the law of the land.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_335.wav	2.52	There was no time scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_336.wav	4.18	In his absence, the council adopted the change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_337.wav	2.52	It's not long enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_338.wav	2.01	I am so upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_339.wav	2.48	He was not a big name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_340.wav	2.95	The police have to act to help them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_341.wav	3.29	It could have gone either way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_342.wav	2.05	Is that an issue?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_343.wav	2.65	He can do no wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_344.wav	2.52	Finally, he paid for the movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_345.wav	4.22	You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_346.wav	2.65	In Scotland, we keep the faith.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_347.wav	3.80	The team for the first game could be this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_348.wav	3.12	The same things will happen with GM foods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_349.wav	3.93	The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_350.wav	2.13	He did a good job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_351.wav	3.67	We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_352.wav	1.75	Well, it won't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_353.wav	4.14	But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_355.wav	1.84	I'm very lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_356.wav	3.88	In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_357.wav	2.52	The composer will conduct.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_359.wav	2.69	It is not like working for a living.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_360.wav	2.22	They got upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_361.wav	2.35	I saw some good things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_362.wav	4.01	He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_364.wav	5.38	A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_365.wav	5.04	The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_366.wav	3.55	However, it was well worth the wait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_367.wav	2.60	He has seen the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_368.wav	2.26	We will be homeless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_369.wav	2.14	That would help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_372.wav	3.76	He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_373.wav	3.03	It's not pretty, but it's effective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p251\p251_374.wav	4.19	His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_001.wav	3.07	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_002.wav	4.31	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_003.wav	7.81	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_004.wav	5.59	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_005.wav	6.70	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_006.wav	5.51	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_007.wav	5.04	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_008.wav	7.34	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_009.wav	5.17	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_010.wav	3.67	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_011.wav	7.26	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_012.wav	5.30	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_013.wav	4.74	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_014.wav	5.42	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_015.wav	8.37	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_016.wav	7.64	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_017.wav	4.27	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_018.wav	6.27	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_019.wav	7.56	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_020.wav	4.91	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_021.wav	9.18	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored bands increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_022.wav	7.51	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-position of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_023.wav	12.54	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_024.wav	8.03	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_025.wav	5.33	Then nine minutes before half time Kenny Miller struck.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_026.wav	2.78	This would include insurance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_027.wav	2.99	It would fit very well with us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_028.wav	3.46	He does not even trust his own members.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_029.wav	3.46	Do not give your details to anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_030.wav	4.01	Schools do not create that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_032.wav	5.00	The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_033.wav	3.76	Just look at his fashion sense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_034.wav	2.65	I have every confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_035.wav	2.99	He added that her comments were noted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_036.wav	2.95	We've got a real battle now with Richard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_037.wav	2.90	Instead, we make the ground pay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_038.wav	2.90	That time may never be broken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_039.wav	4.23	Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_040.wav	5.12	He too started on the subs seats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_041.wav	2.31	I'm so happy that she did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_042.wav	3.76	We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_043.wav	2.99	This operation will change her life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_044.wav	3.24	Something old something new, as it were.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_045.wav	3.37	The youngsters have put us in a strong position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_046.wav	3.50	They seem too much of a sure thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_047.wav	2.61	That's what set him apart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_048.wav	3.25	You must always attempt to raise the bar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_050.wav	4.82	The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_051.wav	2.82	She continued to enjoy sport.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_052.wav	5.38	Downing Street also rejected the calls for a European army.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_053.wav	3.12	By all accounts he was delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_054.wav	3.84	Schools will not want change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_055.wav	3.46	I think I'm a bit too young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_056.wav	3.20	He was failed by his health authority.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_057.wav	3.54	We wish to win, but not at any price.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_058.wav	3.46	I agree with you about this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_059.wav	2.22	Or so he thought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_060.wav	2.90	Must be prepared to use it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_061.wav	3.42	The fifth was found later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_062.wav	2.99	For a decade she was proved right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_063.wav	4.01	It was dangerous but vital employment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_064.wav	2.82	Our people are ready.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_065.wav	3.93	These figures cover the major British banking groups.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_066.wav	3.59	Probably he wasn't thinking at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_067.wav	3.58	Some of their players seemed almost dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_068.wav	2.91	People come to see the Highlands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_069.wav	2.61	It would have to be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_071.wav	3.16	This is a great opportunity for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_072.wav	2.31	That is not possible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_073.wav	2.73	None has ever been found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_074.wav	3.50	Insurance will perhaps reduce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_075.wav	3.16	Their time has gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_076.wav	3.12	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_077.wav	2.39	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_078.wav	2.52	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_079.wav	2.56	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_080.wav	2.05	What do we do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_081.wav	2.90	Why do it otherwise ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_082.wav	4.31	What kind of a man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_083.wav	3.20	Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_084.wav	2.56	He has a real potential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_085.wav	2.69	LET there be light.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_086.wav	3.63	I can't remember a lot about the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_087.wav	2.65	Scotland has great assets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_088.wav	2.30	That remains the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_089.wav	5.04	It was exactly four months away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_090.wav	3.97	There is no issue of national security involved here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_091.wav	4.48	Earlier, both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_092.wav	3.29	Put simply, it goes something like this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_093.wav	3.03	Even if he doesn't have any lines.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_094.wav	2.86	The car driver died.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_095.wav	1.97	It looks that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_096.wav	2.60	Now comes the hard part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_097.wav	4.10	We are already seeing some positive results.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_098.wav	4.02	We're at home, which is important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_099.wav	3.93	They prepared some food very quickly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_100.wav	4.83	The circumstances have changed since last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_101.wav	8.07	In his new cabinet role as party chairman, it will become his primary task.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_102.wav	3.29	They had three children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_103.wav	4.40	Some young girls also came by last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_104.wav	2.95	The idea is the shop within a shop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_105.wav	4.49	It would be easy to think so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_106.wav	2.35	And so it went on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_108.wav	3.37	Scotland were on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_109.wav	5.38	We want the results as soon as possible before Thursday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_110.wav	2.99	He gets his moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_111.wav	4.70	The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_112.wav	2.39	There was no reason.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_113.wav	1.97	It gets too much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_114.wav	1.96	So they should be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_115.wav	2.26	No progress has been made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_116.wav	1.97	They need the money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_117.wav	4.48	That is the only way to rate players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_118.wav	4.14	Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_119.wav	3.24	Its failure is no surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_120.wav	4.23	No country has a similar training programme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_121.wav	8.84	Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_122.wav	3.25	Consumers will also benefit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_123.wav	3.29	They pointed to the site.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_124.wav	4.99	Tony Blair said as little.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_125.wav	3.89	He is at peace with himself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_126.wav	3.42	Gold admitted as much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_127.wav	4.01	It seemed like four hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_128.wav	4.27	Evidence must not be held back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_129.wav	4.05	We beat the Welsh team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_130.wav	4.53	I saw a lot of good things against Livingston.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_131.wav	4.18	Britain's role was to stop it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_132.wav	4.78	The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_133.wav	3.46	Eight others have followed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_134.wav	4.70	We're currently looking at the level of support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_135.wav	6.27	Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_136.wav	5.04	Strong growth is expected from the industrial services division.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_137.wav	5.33	It's nice to see a very positive style of football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_138.wav	4.10	No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_139.wav	3.41	It should have its own network.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_140.wav	4.10	As our national coach, Brown is done for.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_141.wav	4.19	But this wasn't the full picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_142.wav	3.50	That shows the impact it had.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_143.wav	4.91	Domestic orders have also fallen since January.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_144.wav	2.99	I'd always wanted to act.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_145.wav	7.13	We hope he will do until he finally does the double.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_146.wav	4.10	That is a big risk at any price.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_147.wav	3.84	I am never fully fit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_148.wav	2.99	Are you going to win ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_149.wav	2.43	Was it the wife ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_150.wav	1.88	Why change it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_151.wav	3.88	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_152.wav	2.56	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_153.wav	2.73	how do you get it back ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_154.wav	3.42	What are you not good at ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_155.wav	3.16	I think, therefore I am ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_156.wav	2.18	Who was she ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_157.wav	5.72	He said some things which were better left alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_158.wav	2.73	He nearly killed my son.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_160.wav	5.46	Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_161.wav	4.10	I told them during their morning break.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_162.wav	6.79	Parents of pupils at the school have also expressed concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_163.wav	3.93	Mr Dewar understood that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_164.wav	5.46	Nato has left them with no other option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_165.wav	4.01	They have shown great character.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_166.wav	4.23	I am secure in my own position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_167.wav	3.38	It wasn't a pretty match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_168.wav	6.10	Health experts said they were not surprised by the findings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_169.wav	6.44	Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_170.wav	3.20	The second failed completely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_171.wav	4.61	That apart, though, I feel good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_172.wav	3.59	We have come a long way since then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_173.wav	3.12	Sport is good for you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_174.wav	3.29	It was clearly not a battle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_175.wav	4.57	I made my mind up before we came on tour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_176.wav	7.17	You are looking at specialist staff and specialist staff cost money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_177.wav	4.10	I'd rather be in our position than Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_178.wav	3.42	All options are available.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_179.wav	3.63	I knew Donald Dewar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_181.wav	4.49	Parents do not know very much about drugs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_182.wav	5.25	Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_183.wav	3.71	I've no idea how it works.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_184.wav	5.16	It is actually building on the existing business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_185.wav	3.80	Maybe this battle had been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_186.wav	5.59	Art can challenge our value system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_187.wav	8.02	It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_188.wav	5.08	London remained the favourite.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_189.wav	4.61	I've never had a year like this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_190.wav	6.62	He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_191.wav	4.18	She really suffered for her art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_193.wav	2.73	We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_194.wav	3.50	A child is not a product.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_195.wav	3.08	Which can happen any time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_196.wav	4.74	Scottish Life was there over one year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_197.wav	3.42	Now he is back on top again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_198.wav	2.65	The hotel was huge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_199.wav	4.78	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_200.wav	3.80	was everything done to save people ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_201.wav	3.54	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_202.wav	3.88	Do I think about them often ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_203.wav	3.63	Is it in the right place ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_204.wav	4.91	Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_205.wav	3.24	This should begin in October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_206.wav	5.68	There remains some Scottish influence, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_207.wav	5.00	My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_208.wav	3.63	The role was perfect for Russell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_209.wav	7.00	The price was raised after massive demands from retail investors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_210.wav	4.40	If not, a deal could take many months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_211.wav	3.46	Their bodies were never found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_212.wav	3.97	It plans to return to this field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_213.wav	3.89	Business will continue as usual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_214.wav	3.20	I want a free vote.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_215.wav	4.31	Fine, said the press officer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_216.wav	5.25	The questions came quick and fast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_217.wav	4.40	The Boys can speak about little else.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_218.wav	4.44	Her experience is certainly limited.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_219.wav	3.54	We tried four banks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_220.wav	4.31	There is no doubt there's room for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_221.wav	4.48	The labour side had developed in the North area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_222.wav	5.76	Good records have also been recognised by successful farmers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_223.wav	3.46	Brian was last to join.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_224.wav	5.47	He has many offers from the English Premiership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_225.wav	3.93	Now the door has opened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_226.wav	2.77	I'd rather play well next week than here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_227.wav	3.89	Her death is a huge blow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_228.wav	4.53	The global market was about flat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_229.wav	2.90	Three hit the target.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_230.wav	2.39	The idea is simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_231.wav	5.68	Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_232.wav	4.40	It's used by Ayr Technical College.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_233.wav	7.17	The Queen was on the ball yesterday but off the Euro.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_234.wav	2.39	We know the problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_235.wav	3.59	Britain will be little affected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_236.wav	3.97	There is a good reason for this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_237.wav	2.91	You know the type.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_238.wav	7.04	The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_239.wav	3.72	The board do not own the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_240.wav	4.01	That time is not far away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_241.wav	5.25	That's been the difference between the sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_242.wav	2.69	When I was training.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_243.wav	3.84	I did let myself down a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_244.wav	4.82	One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_245.wav	3.54	This is absolutely not true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_246.wav	6.96	Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_247.wav	3.12	It was a great evening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_248.wav	3.33	We have several options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_250.wav	5.17	Our focus remains on quality revenue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_251.wav	4.27	Perhaps it will happen again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_252.wav	7.94	The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_253.wav	5.25	It is based on population rather than need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_254.wav	3.84	We were leading by two goals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_255.wav	5.42	It had happened on average once a week this year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_256.wav	7.00	It is very much in the eye of the individual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_258.wav	2.82	It was an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_260.wav	3.89	My goals have never changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_262.wav	4.10	So we kept them waiting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_263.wav	3.38	He makes time for everyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_264.wav	6.66	That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_265.wav	3.50	The proposal was rejected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_266.wav	3.50	Look at a computer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_267.wav	3.76	He did better then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_268.wav	4.57	But the next day she paid for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_269.wav	5.68	We still think this trade is on the increase.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_270.wav	8.71	It is also hoped big name stars could be brought on board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_271.wav	4.86	This was the perfect setting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_273.wav	9.35	The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_274.wav	4.82	The long-term trend is equally clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_275.wav	8.06	I see no reason to doubt that the situation in Scotland is any different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_276.wav	5.29	All films open tomorrow
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_277.wav	5.08	If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_278.wav	3.72	Paul never gave up hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_279.wav	5.64	Those three goals in five minutes changed the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_280.wav	4.06	They bought the property four years ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_281.wav	7.39	I hope numbers will be up on last time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_282.wav	7.98	Their only score of the half came from a penalty by Jones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_283.wav	3.37	It is a dangerous sport.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_284.wav	5.51	Oil stocks also provided a boost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_286.wav	6.36	The future might well be green after all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_287.wav	5.04	They were seriously after him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_288.wav	4.27	It was a bit like having children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_289.wav	3.89	Aberdeen had little to offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_290.wav	5.81	Donald felt it would be an appropriate thing to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_291.wav	4.99	I'm interested in interesting work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_292.wav	4.74	His season started this afternoon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_293.wav	5.72	He is a good signing for Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_294.wav	7.68	White would like to buy further bus businesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_295.wav	3.50	Kenny and I are ready.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_296.wav	4.61	Friday night was a pretty good night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_297.wav	5.93	He also worked on general building contracts in the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_298.wav	3.63	They have played their part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_299.wav	4.78	He followed the Italian route.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_300.wav	7.30	Stephen had never considered the question of compensation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_301.wav	6.96	The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_302.wav	3.37	So does every industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_303.wav	3.80	Tomorrow will be my last.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_304.wav	5.21	But there's also a love for the songs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_305.wav	9.60	His career may also provide food for thought for Ferguson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_306.wav	3.67	We must move on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_307.wav	4.05	It's just an area of water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_308.wav	4.10	We have achieved that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_309.wav	4.74	Their eyes, however, told a different story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_310.wav	4.06	Good players have become bad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_311.wav	4.99	Many events are down on numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_312.wav	4.48	He had served his time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_313.wav	4.44	It was a total surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_314.wav	6.45	If a service doesn't pay it will go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_315.wav	4.57	The process will start tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_316.wav	5.46	Motherwell took them from half chances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_317.wav	5.38	That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_319.wav	3.89	One finding emerged clearly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_320.wav	9.77	There was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_321.wav	5.17	We lost to a poor team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_322.wav	3.84	We are keen to see truth and justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_323.wav	6.49	We have clearly become well established.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_324.wav	7.98	The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_325.wav	4.27	Murray plays down return
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_326.wav	3.80	Other teams moved up too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_327.wav	4.40	Not one person spoke badly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_328.wav	3.42	We were caught out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_329.wav	5.29	The performance continues to improve.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_330.wav	4.36	We want immediate action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_331.wav	4.87	Our relationship has been very good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_332.wav	4.10	Someone should tell them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_333.wav	4.61	But it won't help British farmers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_334.wav	4.74	Does that put pressure on us ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_335.wav	2.52	Did it work ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_336.wav	4.44	Do you think we are a top nation ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_337.wav	5.34	Is our children learning ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_338.wav	6.53	How independent is that ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_339.wav	3.50	Because I think it's there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_340.wav	3.89	If we get the wrong candidate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_341.wav	5.25	They emerged before the patients left hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_342.wav	5.59	They will now remain split up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_343.wav	5.25	We are a husband and wife team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_344.wav	3.67	It was the September weekend after all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_345.wav	3.55	He would add value.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_346.wav	7.08	Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_347.wav	5.51	Those overseas offices were great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_348.wav	4.95	That was our last chance to do something.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_349.wav	2.95	Maybe she is right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_350.wav	4.78	I saw one man vote five times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_351.wav	6.15	No plans for projects are yet in place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_352.wav	5.08	No sport needs that sort of thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_353.wav	9.43	The senior management team will be drawn from both companies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_354.wav	5.55	Any increase always has some effect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_355.wav	5.04	What form did that take ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_356.wav	3.12	Are they free ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_357.wav	3.08	What are they for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_358.wav	3.25	Is there a waiting list ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_359.wav	4.99	Do they think anyone else wants them ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_360.wav	3.29	They had better be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_361.wav	5.42	Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_362.wav	3.97	He was a great human being.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_363.wav	4.57	That seems highly unlikely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_364.wav	2.86	Still, I am delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_365.wav	5.64	Analysts welcomed the news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_366.wav	7.90	He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_367.wav	7.81	You will lose benefit because you have broken the rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_368.wav	5.42	They made such decisions in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_369.wav	6.70	Results of the survey are expected by the end of June.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_370.wav	6.45	The whole system is too complex.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_371.wav	5.89	He said legal action could be considered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_372.wav	11.27	The European elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_373.wav	4.44	This is far too high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_374.wav	5.63	These matters can't just be medical decisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_375.wav	7.56	If you believe in the blue and white.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_376.wav	8.19	We have no information on Iraq.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_378.wav	6.02	The referee faces a massive job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_379.wav	6.02	That could be ready within another nine months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_380.wav	4.66	Next league matches Kilmarnock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_381.wav	4.82	An appeal was unlikely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_382.wav	7.34	He said he had now written to Scottish Industry Minister Lord Macdonald.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_383.wav	3.58	I got dropped for that game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_384.wav	5.77	No real attempt was made to get orders.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_385.wav	7.04	Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_386.wav	3.33	This year I understood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_387.wav	3.46	It's clearly a budget.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_388.wav	5.25	It's an option, but I can't really comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_389.wav	4.61	The women are victims here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_390.wav	3.38	I'm not sure that's right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_391.wav	11.09	I've kept him in touch with everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_392.wav	6.74	The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_393.wav	4.18	There's nothing natural left.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_394.wav	3.63	He could still be President.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_395.wav	3.37	There's always a case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_396.wav	5.93	The new manager must make tough decisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_397.wav	5.55	He has worked hard over the years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_399.wav	2.90	It was too difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_400.wav	3.97	We will miss him against Celtic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_401.wav	2.99	I managed to do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_402.wav	3.59	So what happens next ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_403.wav	5.17	Had this been common practice ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_404.wav	3.33	What do they want us to do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_405.wav	2.60	Is it worth it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_406.wav	1.80	Does it matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_407.wav	5.08	The doctors are quite positive about my progress.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_408.wav	4.74	They had to have hospital treatment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_409.wav	3.71	Five local people were injured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_410.wav	8.71	All the dead were believed to have been French.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p252\p252_411.wav	4.27	I'd like to report a murder.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_001.wav	2.73	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_002.wav	4.40	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_003.wav	7.81	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_004.wav	5.59	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_005.wav	7.64	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_007.wav	4.78	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_008.wav	8.28	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_009.wav	6.02	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_010.wav	3.80	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_011.wav	7.73	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_012.wav	5.25	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_013.wav	5.00	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_014.wav	5.68	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_015.wav	6.49	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_016.wav	7.69	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_017.wav	4.31	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_018.wav	6.40	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_020.wav	4.70	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_021.wav	9.60	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_023.wav	11.39	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_024.wav	7.34	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_025.wav	2.18	But it failed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_026.wav	4.27	Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_027.wav	4.87	Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_028.wav	3.41	However, the following year the cancer returned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_029.wav	3.54	Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_030.wav	2.57	This is the window.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_031.wav	2.99	He was jailed for five years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_032.wav	2.27	Help is needed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_033.wav	3.07	Then, suddenly, they weren't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_034.wav	2.22	It is marvellous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_035.wav	4.22	Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_036.wav	3.84	However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_037.wav	2.35	They're just different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_038.wav	2.18	It was clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_039.wav	2.14	Indeed, he does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_040.wav	4.10	People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_041.wav	4.53	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_042.wav	2.73	Dancing was her life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_043.wav	3.84	The ambition this year is to improve on last.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_044.wav	3.97	It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_045.wav	2.60	They want to be entertained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_046.wav	1.88	It's the only thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_047.wav	2.35	You had better believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_048.wav	4.53	Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_049.wav	3.80	On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_050.wav	1.88	A neighbour said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_051.wav	2.22	It is bizarre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_052.wav	2.52	There is no reason at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_053.wav	3.33	In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_054.wav	3.46	Every aspect of our play was first class.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_055.wav	2.22	Our people are ready.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_056.wav	1.75	Here's a clue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_057.wav	1.50	I was lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_058.wav	3.37	For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_059.wav	2.56	My fitness was very poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_060.wav	4.74	Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_061.wav	1.58	It is unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_062.wav	2.85	I expect a rapid response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_063.wav	2.14	It happened so quickly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_064.wav	1.71	That's the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_065.wav	2.26	It seems to have worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_066.wav	2.35	This is the first step.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_067.wav	2.95	And if he hadn't become a musician?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_068.wav	4.36	There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_069.wav	3.93	I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_071.wav	2.60	Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_072.wav	3.20	Robin Williams is very subdued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_073.wav	4.74	They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_074.wav	2.56	It could take some time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_075.wav	3.84	We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_076.wav	3.63	I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_077.wav	2.95	It is a job creation scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_078.wav	2.48	The party is up for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_079.wav	2.82	People must remain vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_080.wav	4.57	Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_081.wav	2.26	What has changed?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_082.wav	2.31	I will miss him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_083.wav	2.18	He is in the queue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_084.wav	2.69	I first met him last summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_085.wav	3.71	What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_086.wav	4.01	Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_087.wav	4.01	It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_088.wav	2.39	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_089.wav	3.72	The city council is a major property owner in the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_090.wav	4.31	Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_091.wav	3.67	Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_092.wav	2.14	We are on the path of change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_093.wav	3.71	This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_095.wav	2.26	Yet, it worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_096.wav	2.39	He's been hit by it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_097.wav	1.84	I love the Dome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_098.wav	2.74	I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_099.wav	3.12	However, we have not come to any conclusions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_100.wav	1.92	It is a love affair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_101.wav	3.63	Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_102.wav	3.29	They make a selective perception process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_103.wav	2.86	Two of the team became ill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_104.wav	2.18	That would be unlawful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_106.wav	2.90	Oil embargo endorsed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_107.wav	2.35	It was an adventure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_108.wav	5.98	Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_109.wav	3.63	While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_110.wav	4.23	According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_111.wav	2.78	I was fighting for my life, I thought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_112.wav	1.71	Is that right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_113.wav	3.07	He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_114.wav	1.45	It's a shame.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_115.wav	2.39	It was the eighties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_116.wav	1.97	It is so sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_117.wav	4.10	Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_118.wav	1.75	The mood is upbeat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_119.wav	1.45	It is rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_120.wav	2.52	Who would be a referee?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_121.wav	4.40	That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_122.wav	2.26	We enjoyed it today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_123.wav	4.23	His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_124.wav	2.86	Here, again, they were denied a voice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_125.wav	2.95	There were no grounds for his action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_126.wav	1.67	I'm so angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_127.wav	2.69	She really suffered for her art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_128.wav	3.54	It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_129.wav	2.22	It's not a U-turn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_130.wav	2.56	No production was achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_131.wav	2.14	I am now unemployed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_132.wav	3.67	We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_133.wav	2.65	It plans to return to this field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_134.wav	2.22	We work well together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_135.wav	3.59	The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_136.wav	4.74	We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_138.wav	1.79	I was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_139.wav	2.22	I don't know the full story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_140.wav	4.57	Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_141.wav	2.31	She died at her home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_142.wav	3.42	He realises his mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_143.wav	5.29	He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_144.wav	4.70	Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_145.wav	1.80	I was awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_146.wav	1.58	Who would have?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_147.wav	4.82	He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_148.wav	2.86	It is not just about pay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_149.wav	4.14	It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_150.wav	2.61	There was a substantial explosion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_151.wav	1.97	I was stunned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_152.wav	3.84	The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_153.wav	2.65	The weather forecast isn't good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_154.wav	2.26	They have not been named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_156.wav	1.92	My Dad is a hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_157.wav	3.93	For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_158.wav	2.39	Words were not required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_160.wav	2.10	Life becomes a song.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_161.wav	1.88	Well, he should know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_162.wav	2.94	Was this element always there?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_163.wav	2.31	These days are long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_164.wav	2.31	I'd love to be like Peter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_165.wav	3.21	I've put my own money into this project.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_167.wav	4.69	Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_168.wav	2.99	I was in the train station overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_169.wav	2.48	We have a budget in March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_170.wav	2.69	We should do everything at a stroke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_171.wav	2.18	You had to go and see him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_173.wav	2.31	In a way he was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_175.wav	2.44	Blair's response was weak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_176.wav	1.92	As we worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_177.wav	2.78	We are the gateway to justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_178.wav	4.27	I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_179.wav	1.92	The goals were good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_180.wav	4.10	Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_181.wav	1.96	It's an idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_182.wav	3.63	It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_183.wav	2.74	They need to look after themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_184.wav	3.38	I saw military vehicles in the distance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_185.wav	4.31	Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_186.wav	1.75	Does this matter?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_187.wav	2.95	Our team is just so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_188.wav	2.82	Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_189.wav	4.10	However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_190.wav	2.90	It caused a lot of upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_191.wav	4.31	But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_192.wav	2.35	We speak about the performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_194.wav	1.75	Peace was won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_195.wav	1.58	It's a fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_196.wav	2.69	I came home by ambulance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_197.wav	5.21	It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_198.wav	1.80	Is that success?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_199.wav	4.65	I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_200.wav	2.05	Who will pay for this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_201.wav	3.54	It's all about money, money, money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_202.wav	2.31	Sadly, it can't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_203.wav	2.31	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_205.wav	2.91	We have an election in eight days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_206.wav	1.62	Feel the heat?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_207.wav	4.57	The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_208.wav	2.82	Twaddle is a case in point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_209.wav	2.69	It had all been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_211.wav	2.48	Work has started.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_212.wav	4.40	The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_213.wav	4.10	On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_214.wav	4.14	The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_215.wav	3.97	Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_216.wav	4.36	This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_217.wav	2.31	Then another one came.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_218.wav	3.67	The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_219.wav	2.65	If it doesn't, it doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_220.wav	2.44	Clearly, the stakes are high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_221.wav	3.33	It's a question of creating a future awareness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_222.wav	2.60	I'd never seen a play about me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_223.wav	2.22	It's not before time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_224.wav	2.82	I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_225.wav	4.02	I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_226.wav	3.37	I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_227.wav	5.46	Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_228.wav	3.33	My wife and family are the support system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_229.wav	4.05	Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_230.wav	4.27	Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_231.wav	1.80	We are so proud.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_232.wav	2.95	The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_233.wav	2.09	Of course I was tempted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_234.wav	2.31	It's quite a line-up!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_235.wav	3.76	On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_236.wav	2.39	The minister is the engineer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_237.wav	3.76	I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_238.wav	2.39	It is hard won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_239.wav	1.92	Our policy is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_240.wav	4.22	I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_241.wav	2.56	The scene is about this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_242.wav	4.10	In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_243.wav	2.48	My son was too young to die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_244.wav	3.29	In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_245.wav	3.80	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_247.wav	3.85	Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_248.wav	2.65	That could be in place by next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_249.wav	4.57	For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_250.wav	3.76	It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_251.wav	3.63	That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_252.wav	2.35	they fail to engage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_253.wav	3.71	It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_254.wav	3.89	One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_255.wav	2.05	They must play for each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_256.wav	4.23	However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_257.wav	2.52	There's not much money in cycling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_258.wav	3.41	This court has made an order which has not been observed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_260.wav	4.10	That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_261.wav	3.25	He has not created a Festival resource.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_262.wav	5.25	He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_263.wav	3.59	He was also married with two children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_264.wav	3.84	It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_265.wav	3.42	Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_266.wav	3.16	Our objective is to tackle poverty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_267.wav	1.96	One knows the feeling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_268.wav	4.23	Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_269.wav	5.17	The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_270.wav	3.63	She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_271.wav	2.31	She failed in her action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_272.wav	3.25	He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_273.wav	1.75	She looked so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_274.wav	3.16	In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_275.wav	1.67	It's so awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_276.wav	3.84	Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_277.wav	3.80	There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_278.wav	2.60	You've got to have both sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_279.wav	3.42	Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_280.wav	2.61	Dialogue is the key.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_281.wav	3.16	They have shown a great desire and attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_282.wav	3.16	She is an expert on medical ethics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_283.wav	1.58	Who will perform?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_285.wav	2.05	Who did the recruiting?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_287.wav	4.83	That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_288.wav	2.48	I was the sheep.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_289.wav	3.67	I was brought up in a mining background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_290.wav	4.74	In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_291.wav	1.71	Nothing is safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_292.wav	2.44	But it's a subtle process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_293.wav	2.01	One was a lawyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_294.wav	3.93	The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_296.wav	1.50	They are wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_297.wav	2.77	Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_298.wav	2.60	There were no passengers on board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_299.wav	1.58	It could work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_300.wav	3.20	This is a war over our home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_301.wav	4.35	Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_302.wav	2.82	There's no evidence he was ever there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_303.wav	1.62	You should be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_304.wav	3.85	However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_305.wav	3.16	The letters are going out today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_307.wav	3.37	The Premier League has been a huge success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_308.wav	4.57	Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_309.wav	2.35	She is very distinctive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_310.wav	2.82	We have got to get the points from this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_311.wav	2.61	You may have a short memory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_313.wav	3.07	We are in the end game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_314.wav	1.67	It will work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_316.wav	3.71	They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_317.wav	1.97	Our message was inclusive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_318.wav	4.78	But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_319.wav	2.65	Feel the air, the space.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_320.wav	2.31	Is there a new way forward?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_322.wav	3.33	The figures are bad, but not that bad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_323.wav	4.14	Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_324.wav	3.54	However, they will only be found in the wild.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_326.wav	2.78	Three years ago he would have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_327.wav	3.16	That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_328.wav	3.55	Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_329.wav	2.77	Two people were interviewed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_330.wav	1.84	I've got no secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_331.wav	3.72	We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_332.wav	2.31	This is a friendly match?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_333.wav	4.70	A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_334.wav	5.59	This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_335.wav	2.82	They should take their mobile phones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_336.wav	4.23	He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_337.wav	5.85	A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_338.wav	5.04	Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_339.wav	1.92	She is free.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_340.wav	3.67	Both of those promises have already been honoured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_341.wav	2.39	Tyson is overwhelmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_342.wav	4.52	In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_343.wav	2.99	Yet he left a few days later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_344.wav	3.63	It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_345.wav	2.52	As, indeed, they would be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_346.wav	3.20	It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_348.wav	4.19	To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_349.wav	4.91	The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_350.wav	1.63	That would help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_351.wav	2.30	My husband was angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_352.wav	4.66	Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_354.wav	3.80	He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_355.wav	2.57	This is a club on the rise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_356.wav	3.37	It's not pretty, but it's effective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_357.wav	1.54	Their time has gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_358.wav	1.45	He could make it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_359.wav	2.48	The death rates are still as high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_360.wav	2.65	Now, though, he has an incentive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_361.wav	4.27	Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_363.wav	3.20	It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_364.wav	2.60	It is a simple equation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_365.wav	3.63	By that time, however, it was already too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_366.wav	2.69	It was a funny game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_367.wav	2.05	There wasn't a goal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_368.wav	4.44	Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_369.wav	2.90	Colour was at the core of his life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_371.wav	2.95	I'm still an amateur in that sense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_372.wav	2.78	The Cabinet is split over the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_373.wav	1.58	Something is wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_374.wav	3.33	Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_375.wav	2.39	That's the name of the game, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_376.wav	3.50	Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_377.wav	4.87	Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_378.wav	2.56	Does that put pressure on us?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_379.wav	3.03	At the last I found a bunker.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_380.wav	2.52	Yet the data is compelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_381.wav	1.79	It's a real problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_382.wav	2.09	It's just outrageous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_383.wav	4.61	He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_384.wav	4.02	The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_385.wav	3.59	Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_386.wav	4.18	The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_387.wav	1.32	They are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_388.wav	1.75	I'm glad I came.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_390.wav	2.05	I've had my time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_391.wav	2.60	It will take place in July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_392.wav	4.02	The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_394.wav	2.86	But, in fact, the reverse is true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_397.wav	2.86	What would be the point?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_399.wav	1.37	It might be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_400.wav	3.12	The weekly average was three hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_401.wav	2.61	Relief was beyond belief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_402.wav	1.88	He got his degree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_403.wav	1.75	went on sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_404.wav	3.50	Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_405.wav	2.73	Until they came to do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_407.wav	2.09	That may be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_408.wav	2.48	It is legally binding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_409.wav	2.82	We went straight into the bedroom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p253\p253_410.wav	2.99	Is there any prospect of this happening?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_001.wav	2.52	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_002.wav	3.54	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_003.wav	7.51	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_004.wav	5.29	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_005.wav	7.13	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_006.wav	5.42	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_007.wav	5.42	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_008.wav	7.30	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_009.wav	4.86	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_010.wav	4.48	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_011.wav	8.11	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_012.wav	5.12	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_013.wav	4.70	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_014.wav	5.42	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_015.wav	5.85	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_016.wav	7.26	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_017.wav	4.65	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_018.wav	5.97	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_019.wav	7.47	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_020.wav	4.18	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_021.wav	9.47	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_022.wav	6.70	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_023.wav	10.33	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_024.wav	8.07	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_025.wav	2.65	Johnson was pretty low.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_026.wav	1.58	But it failed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_027.wav	1.71	They may be wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_028.wav	3.72	I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_029.wav	3.71	They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_030.wav	4.10	The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_031.wav	4.10	Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_032.wav	4.35	So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_033.wav	2.35	It's a matter of balance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_034.wav	4.44	We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_035.wav	3.29	Then, suddenly, they weren't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_037.wav	3.50	They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_038.wav	4.14	However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_039.wav	2.22	They're just different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_040.wav	1.80	It was clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_041.wav	2.65	It is not for any other purpose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_042.wav	3.72	The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_043.wav	1.88	I was scared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_044.wav	4.78	However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_045.wav	3.03	No meaningful response was issued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_046.wav	3.03	That period was a struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_047.wav	3.29	I am just going to go for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_048.wav	2.78	Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_049.wav	3.37	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_050.wav	2.14	It's a crucial award.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_051.wav	3.72	We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_052.wav	1.88	That should do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_053.wav	2.14	It's a blessing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_054.wav	2.39	Is a drug dealer?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_055.wav	2.22	But it might have done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_056.wav	1.97	That time has passed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_057.wav	3.41	The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_058.wav	2.22	He is too weak to move.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_059.wav	1.67	Life is good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_060.wav	2.26	It is the whole package.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_061.wav	2.27	This is a club on the rise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_062.wav	2.94	He had no enemies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_063.wav	3.59	For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_064.wav	3.03	We were surprised to see the photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_065.wav	2.05	That's the day job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_066.wav	3.67	In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_067.wav	4.31	This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_068.wav	4.27	It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_069.wav	2.30	My mother is a widow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_070.wav	4.01	The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_071.wav	2.78	Jobs could go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_072.wav	3.03	Four other charges were dropped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_073.wav	2.18	They're appalled by that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_074.wav	2.56	There was a battle there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_075.wav	2.95	It's good news and long overdue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_076.wav	2.61	And if he hadn't become a musician?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_077.wav	2.99	Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_078.wav	2.26	They never gave up hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_079.wav	3.67	It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_080.wav	2.78	Painful, but only because it's true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_081.wav	2.26	It's all I can do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_082.wav	2.82	The company yesterday refused to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_083.wav	2.60	Both sides have been hit by injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_084.wav	2.82	The price cuts are really exciting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_085.wav	1.88	My office is bare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_086.wav	2.18	Is there a new way forward?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_087.wav	2.13	There was an e-mail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_088.wav	2.30	Even the one she loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_090.wav	3.63	Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_091.wav	2.10	It may well have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_092.wav	3.88	However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_093.wav	3.08	He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_094.wav	2.86	Last week, he was taken into hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_095.wav	2.69	He seems to be pleased with the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_096.wav	1.92	All options are open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_097.wav	1.84	You will be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_098.wav	4.66	Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_099.wav	2.26	And rugby fans can help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_100.wav	2.69	Now the system is right behind us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_101.wav	2.65	However, it did not end that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_102.wav	3.33	This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_103.wav	3.88	The group is due to report by the end of the year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_104.wav	2.01	I love the Dome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_105.wav	4.44	Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_106.wav	3.54	The selection process is still at a very early stage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_107.wav	4.91	Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_108.wav	3.46	However, we have not come to any conclusions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_109.wav	2.69	But it was a pleasure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_110.wav	1.88	He takes the job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_111.wav	1.84	It was an adventure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_112.wav	2.61	That all hope is never lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_113.wav	4.31	And I thought - we have to do something with this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_114.wav	2.61	It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_115.wav	1.97	It is normal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_116.wav	2.56	I was fighting for my life, I thought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_117.wav	1.75	We need to handle it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_118.wav	4.19	Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_119.wav	2.05	It's a long process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_120.wav	2.05	They were behind the wheel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_121.wav	2.61	The fire was above the hole.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_122.wav	3.12	This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_123.wav	4.23	We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_124.wav	4.78	Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_125.wav	4.35	I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_126.wav	1.96	I joined a group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_127.wav	1.67	Does this mean.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_128.wav	4.01	Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_129.wav	2.78	It is a job creation scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_130.wav	4.14	It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_131.wav	1.88	I'm so angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_132.wav	2.56	Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_133.wav	3.76	It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_134.wav	2.60	They keep the atmosphere in mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_135.wav	3.55	It's terrible that he has died the same way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_136.wav	2.95	The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_137.wav	2.95	It plans to return to this field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_138.wav	2.78	Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_139.wav	4.36	Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_140.wav	3.80	Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_141.wav	3.12	Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_143.wav	3.37	I was the last man to touch the ball.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_144.wav	2.09	Three penalties were given.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_145.wav	5.46	We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_146.wav	1.75	He is severe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_147.wav	2.82	It is difficult for Ali.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_148.wav	2.48	There is a lack of chemistry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_149.wav	3.03	This is the way things should be handled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_150.wav	4.27	He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_151.wav	4.57	Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_152.wav	2.69	It is not just about pay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_153.wav	4.57	Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_154.wav	1.75	You know the type.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_155.wav	2.22	The weaknesses are few.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_156.wav	4.02	The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_157.wav	1.92	I was in daily contact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_158.wav	2.18	We will turn the corner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_159.wav	3.93	This latter point is hugely important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_160.wav	3.12	Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_161.wav	2.82	It has been a lovely family occasion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_162.wav	1.97	He's a nice guy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_163.wav	2.43	It has to be now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_164.wav	2.39	They are not advertised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_165.wav	2.48	I have got a wife to feed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_166.wav	2.09	Tell it like it was?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_167.wav	4.23	It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_168.wav	3.33	Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_169.wav	3.42	We started to struggle with each other towards the end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_170.wav	2.94	Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_171.wav	1.88	He was a crazy man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_172.wav	3.63	They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_173.wav	3.29	First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_174.wav	4.48	However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_175.wav	3.20	It was a great achievement to win at Wembley.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_176.wav	3.88	It is not either national standards or local control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_177.wav	1.96	The clarity is vital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_178.wav	2.52	The hotel was now for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_179.wav	1.97	Tony had arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_180.wav	2.39	He will need that machine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_181.wav	1.96	I was totally wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_182.wav	2.22	We did everything by the book.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_183.wav	4.06	We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_184.wav	3.12	However, this idea is never developed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_185.wav	2.69	I grew up listening to these people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_186.wav	3.33	The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_187.wav	1.75	Peace was won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_188.wav	4.99	It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_189.wav	2.73	I wanted to put myself on the line.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_190.wav	2.14	Off I went.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_191.wav	4.14	The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_192.wav	1.45	Is that it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_193.wav	2.78	The conference is the first test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_194.wav	4.06	On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_195.wav	3.37	The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_196.wav	4.27	I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_197.wav	2.78	They've got three-quarters of the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_198.wav	3.71	The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_199.wav	2.27	Today was first class.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_200.wav	3.89	We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_201.wav	2.73	We have an election in eight days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_202.wav	2.35	It's like a garage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_203.wav	2.09	But I am a worried man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_204.wav	3.12	This gives a financial incentive to switch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_205.wav	3.93	That is an important part of our role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_206.wav	3.80	It is a small part, and it's very small in the book.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_207.wav	4.36	We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_208.wav	1.79	I began to pray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_209.wav	3.50	A Grampian Police spokesman said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_210.wav	2.35	His third goal was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_211.wav	2.27	It's not ideal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_212.wav	2.82	The FBI could become involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_213.wav	3.59	On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_214.wav	3.63	The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_215.wav	4.27	But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_216.wav	2.69	A career as a doctor is on hold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_217.wav	2.09	You have to do your research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_218.wav	2.43	Saturday is gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_219.wav	2.43	We played them off the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_220.wav	2.90	If it doesn't, it doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_221.wav	2.18	Clearly, the stakes are high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_222.wav	2.52	The boy is no longer with us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_223.wav	3.03	The track is currently covered in snow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_224.wav	2.65	They are the innocent victims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_225.wav	2.01	It's so special.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_226.wav	5.63	Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_227.wav	3.03	At the time, he was a living legend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_228.wav	4.40	Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_229.wav	3.03	Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_230.wav	2.52	They tried to give her advice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_231.wav	2.86	And thought we would get away with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_232.wav	2.39	We were a load of rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_233.wav	2.05	They should come forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_234.wav	2.39	It is not the message alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_235.wav	3.67	He will make a statement on the dispute in the Commons tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_236.wav	3.50	The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_237.wav	2.39	It's a lovely, lovely film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_238.wav	2.39	But it's a subtle process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_239.wav	4.14	The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_240.wav	2.39	My future is in the marathon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_241.wav	2.48	They are all bright and different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_242.wav	3.24	Chambers said he would accept the place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_243.wav	4.10	I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_244.wav	4.52	In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_245.wav	3.72	The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_246.wav	2.18	He got the same story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_247.wav	2.73	Washington is consumed by the crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_248.wav	1.54	I was shocked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_249.wav	1.96	He's a lovely young man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_250.wav	1.80	There's the mix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_251.wav	2.99	There will be widespread support on all sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_252.wav	2.18	This year I understood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_253.wav	3.12	That could be in place by next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_254.wav	2.31	I was never going to play against Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_255.wav	2.35	It's a source of deep concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_256.wav	4.36	For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_257.wav	4.23	However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_258.wav	2.60	The pensioners did not want to know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_259.wav	2.61	It is also very valuable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_260.wav	3.50	This court has made an order which has not been observed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_261.wav	3.88	The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_262.wav	3.42	He thought he had a month to cross the street.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_263.wav	3.67	That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_264.wav	2.52	They want to shut the Scottish Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_265.wav	1.75	There is no link.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_266.wav	2.73	This is a question of Islam.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_267.wav	3.63	The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_268.wav	4.44	He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_269.wav	4.70	Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_270.wav	2.69	It was an easy decision to come here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_271.wav	3.93	We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_272.wav	4.14	It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_273.wav	3.46	Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_275.wav	4.19	Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_276.wav	4.23	Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_277.wav	2.01	It's a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_278.wav	3.33	She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_279.wav	3.67	However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_280.wav	2.05	People have no choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_281.wav	2.35	If not, he should go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_282.wav	2.99	For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_283.wav	3.67	There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_284.wav	4.61	You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_285.wav	2.48	I saw it at a ruck.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_286.wav	4.01	This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_287.wav	2.69	What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_288.wav	2.39	He will address the nation this evening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_289.wav	1.58	The mood is good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_290.wav	3.03	It's like a high school play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_291.wav	3.89	The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_292.wav	2.22	This is a national crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_293.wav	2.39	Well, he can do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_294.wav	2.48	These figures are truly awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_295.wav	1.75	That could change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_296.wav	1.71	Who can predict?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_297.wav	4.57	In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_298.wav	2.05	One was a lawyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_299.wav	3.93	It is a road of death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_300.wav	2.31	The plot is minimal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_301.wav	3.67	The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_302.wav	2.05	I did not name it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_303.wav	2.74	We have waited a long time for this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_304.wav	4.31	Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_305.wav	2.01	They were fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_306.wav	2.05	We are a peaceful people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_307.wav	2.69	Craig is a major concern for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_308.wav	2.52	The problems began a long time ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_309.wav	2.44	My body is clearly capable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_310.wav	1.79	It is out there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_311.wav	2.31	He said she was mad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_312.wav	2.61	In the old days, it was easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_313.wav	2.44	We are in the end game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_314.wav	3.89	They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_315.wav	2.39	It is a strong case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_316.wav	2.98	The parents will have a great time, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_317.wav	1.96	Donald was his friend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_318.wav	2.43	He was not a big name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_319.wav	3.25	The police have to act to help them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_320.wav	2.48	It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_321.wav	2.09	The boat was fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_322.wav	1.75	It's not long enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_323.wav	2.95	My first concern is for the safety of the public.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_324.wav	3.55	Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_326.wav	2.22	Finally, he paid for the movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_327.wav	2.95	You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_329.wav	2.95	It would appear that it has not been a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_330.wav	1.96	They haven't got a hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_331.wav	2.39	It has moved on in the last week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_332.wav	2.82	I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_333.wav	2.35	Today she has been released.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_334.wav	3.84	The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_335.wav	2.39	It should be a great game, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_336.wav	4.27	It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_337.wav	1.71	It should be scrapped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_338.wav	4.02	A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_339.wav	3.24	It was good for us that they lost that day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_340.wav	2.22	They should take their mobile phones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_341.wav	2.56	It is not like working for a living.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_342.wav	3.76	Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_343.wav	1.79	It is long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_344.wav	3.25	The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_345.wav	1.67	Tell us about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_346.wav	3.08	It's all going to clear the debt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_347.wav	2.69	That is a break with tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_348.wav	4.74	A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_349.wav	2.10	It was very formal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_350.wav	2.39	I kept going for her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_351.wav	4.10	The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_352.wav	5.08	But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_353.wav	3.93	No other job in world football can compare to this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_354.wav	3.20	Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_355.wav	1.97	We will be homeless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_356.wav	2.90	New Zealand rugby is totally different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_357.wav	3.76	On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_358.wav	3.03	It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_359.wav	3.59	His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_360.wav	3.59	We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_361.wav	3.67	Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_362.wav	3.33	The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_363.wav	1.71	There was no option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_364.wav	2.44	It's now down in black and white.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_365.wav	2.78	Now, though, he has an incentive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_366.wav	2.56	It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_367.wav	2.78	They received a reply from their own managers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_368.wav	1.28	But I managed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_369.wav	2.05	Five members were disciplined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_370.wav	1.92	Talks are progressing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_371.wav	2.31	They play together perfectly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_372.wav	3.72	Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_373.wav	2.95	It's a record label, not a form of music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_374.wav	1.97	It became a national network.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_375.wav	2.43	It is a large number.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_376.wav	2.69	We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_377.wav	4.10	Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_378.wav	1.71	He has the edge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_379.wav	3.37	Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_380.wav	2.78	Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_381.wav	1.93	Face to face
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_382.wav	2.18	I am very happy with life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_383.wav	2.52	I'm just enjoying every match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_384.wav	3.80	The service would also make a massive impact on tourism.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_385.wav	3.80	Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_386.wav	3.97	Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_387.wav	3.20	We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_388.wav	2.26	They really did a great job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_389.wav	2.26	At the last I found a bunker.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_390.wav	2.13	Yet the data is compelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_391.wav	2.95	Perhaps the time has come to put the cup in a museum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_392.wav	3.12	I would have loved to play in an Old Firm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_393.wav	1.96	I'm pleased about one thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_394.wav	3.08	It is also claimed that he was murdered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_395.wav	3.54	Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_396.wav	2.43	We're looking for justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_397.wav	2.78	I can lead by example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_398.wav	2.65	Eriksson would have approved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_399.wav	2.61	Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_400.wav	2.22	It was a breathtaking moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_401.wav	2.44	It really is a gift to the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_402.wav	1.88	The car was just there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p254\p254_403.wav	1.84	It was on fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_001.wav	3.33	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_002.wav	3.76	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_003.wav	9.01	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_004.wav	6.92	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_005.wav	7.56	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_006.wav	6.36	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_007.wav	4.57	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_008.wav	8.49	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_009.wav	5.33	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_010.wav	3.38	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_011.wav	7.22	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_012.wav	5.33	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_013.wav	4.78	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_014.wav	5.47	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_015.wav	6.32	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_016.wav	7.34	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_017.wav	3.55	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_018.wav	5.72	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_019.wav	7.13	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_020.wav	4.61	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_021.wav	9.47	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_022.wav	7.85	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_023.wav	13.15	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_024.wav	7.77	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_025.wav	2.35	He has not been named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_026.wav	3.67	We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_027.wav	2.09	They should be so lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_028.wav	4.40	We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_029.wav	5.04	They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_030.wav	2.78	Life was like a timetable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_031.wav	5.12	Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_032.wav	3.33	Then, suddenly, they weren't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_033.wav	3.29	It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_034.wav	3.72	In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_035.wav	5.80	Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_036.wav	3.03	We do not expect any surplus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_037.wav	2.65	Dancing was her life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_038.wav	5.68	It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_039.wav	2.99	It is a memorial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_040.wav	3.59	Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_041.wav	2.77	But it might have done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_042.wav	4.65	The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_043.wav	4.61	People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_044.wav	4.06	I felt really good until Friday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_045.wav	2.61	She looked so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_046.wav	2.05	Life is good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_047.wav	4.65	No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_048.wav	4.61	I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_049.wav	3.29	We were surprised to see the photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_050.wav	4.69	It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_051.wav	4.40	Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_052.wav	2.86	It's very odd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_053.wav	3.12	Because we do not need it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_054.wav	2.65	That's the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_055.wav	2.56	My mother is a widow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_057.wav	5.04	George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_058.wav	3.63	There will be tough opponents to this report.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_059.wav	3.07	Equity declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_060.wav	3.76	Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_061.wav	6.06	Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_062.wav	4.19	There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_063.wav	1.97	We should have known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_064.wav	3.41	We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_065.wav	3.24	The end result is precisely the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_066.wav	4.57	It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_067.wav	3.25	There is an element of racism in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_068.wav	2.99	There could be a way back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_069.wav	2.99	He highlighted a lack of staff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_070.wav	3.37	Then followed a bout of flu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_071.wav	2.69	Ferguson should take note.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_072.wav	2.01	It works for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_073.wav	2.86	He is now resident in England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_074.wav	2.31	I've got the shirt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_075.wav	4.35	Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_076.wav	2.22	What has changed?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_077.wav	4.49	However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_078.wav	3.42	Last week, he was taken into hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_079.wav	2.48	He is driven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_080.wav	2.48	Nothing is yet confirmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_081.wav	2.61	We have other options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_082.wav	2.73	We want to know about the policy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_083.wav	4.27	It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_084.wav	2.39	It's never too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_085.wav	3.63	Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_086.wav	3.59	We do not get that impression now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_087.wav	2.18	It is a lifeline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_088.wav	3.20	However, it did not end that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_089.wav	3.07	They've got to account for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_090.wav	4.74	That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_091.wav	2.65	Until you hit the big games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_092.wav	2.82	We could not get any possession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_093.wav	2.43	If you could find it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_094.wav	4.48	The selection process is still at a very early stage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_095.wav	2.95	It is a delight on every level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_096.wav	2.05	Get to know him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_097.wav	2.52	May not have been at fault?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_098.wav	2.35	I had a ball today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_099.wav	2.73	Two of the team became ill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_100.wav	3.46	That time is not now, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_101.wav	3.50	Oil embargo endorsed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_102.wav	2.69	Scotland were beaten again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_103.wav	3.25	Before the game we went for a pint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_104.wav	3.41	Further protests are likely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_105.wav	4.27	According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_106.wav	4.53	It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_107.wav	3.42	He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_108.wav	2.48	He was jailed for a year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_109.wav	2.69	I came to complete.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_110.wav	4.99	Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_111.wav	4.23	We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_112.wav	2.86	Maybe this battle has been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_113.wav	3.16	I'm delighted about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_114.wav	4.27	Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_115.wav	2.26	I joined a group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_116.wav	1.97	Does this mean.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_117.wav	4.10	They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_118.wav	4.44	That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_119.wav	4.48	Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_120.wav	5.04	An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_121.wav	3.20	I can't even get into the A team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_122.wav	4.14	Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_123.wav	2.77	Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_124.wav	4.23	His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_125.wav	4.27	Next season for every manager is a long time away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_126.wav	5.50	We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_127.wav	2.26	It will be too hot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_128.wav	3.03	The role was perfect for Russell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_129.wav	4.23	If not, a deal could take many months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_130.wav	4.95	My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_131.wav	2.86	Our intentions are real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_132.wav	2.26	It is also well received.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_133.wav	4.65	The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_134.wav	3.85	We never said that we would walk through the third division.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_135.wav	3.03	Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_136.wav	4.95	On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_137.wav	2.86	I saw some terrible things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_138.wav	2.90	It's a question of fashion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_139.wav	3.71	Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_140.wav	4.35	In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_141.wav	3.12	We have got to get it right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_142.wav	2.95	Wallace was a prisoner of war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_143.wav	3.46	The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_144.wav	2.18	Who would be right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_145.wav	2.18	She died at her home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_146.wav	5.25	Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_147.wav	2.14	I was awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_148.wav	2.65	The idea is simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_149.wav	2.56	It is like a football team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_150.wav	3.16	It would be a last resort.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_151.wav	5.38	He sets the nature of his Parliament in simple, realistic context.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_152.wav	2.31	It is not just about pay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_153.wav	3.21	The home side didn't stand a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_154.wav	2.39	We shall not be moved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_155.wav	2.65	The weaknesses are few.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_156.wav	3.63	The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_157.wav	3.84	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_158.wav	4.27	The first victory made a huge difference to my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_159.wav	3.54	There's a sense of excess in the novel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_160.wav	1.97	Work has started.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_161.wav	3.97	It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_162.wav	2.86	And sooner than we may think.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_163.wav	3.46	The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_164.wav	2.60	It is so unfair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_165.wav	2.22	I will tell you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_166.wav	2.82	Eight months later, he was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_167.wav	3.50	It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_168.wav	2.82	We have to move forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_169.wav	5.12	However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_170.wav	2.39	I lost my head.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_171.wav	3.37	That must be left to the Parole Board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_172.wav	3.33	He is keen to stay in public service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_173.wav	3.16	You are not going in blind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_174.wav	3.37	They will do their own thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_175.wav	5.08	As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_176.wav	2.90	You had to go and see him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_177.wav	3.63	Waiting times for these services are too long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_178.wav	3.76	A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_179.wav	3.21	His team management was protective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_180.wav	2.52	Is Saddam a threat?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_181.wav	2.52	The jury is still out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_182.wav	3.07	We wanted it left for a wee while.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_183.wav	4.40	However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_184.wav	2.56	And I saw the light!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_185.wav	3.93	The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_186.wav	3.88	I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_187.wav	2.35	Tony had arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_188.wav	2.35	It is the whole package.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_189.wav	4.14	I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_190.wav	2.39	The goals were good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_191.wav	2.61	There is no point in looking any further.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_192.wav	4.78	And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_193.wav	2.86	Four policemen were wounded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_194.wav	4.27	Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_195.wav	5.33	The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_196.wav	2.56	They are now divorced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_197.wav	2.82	I cannot say too much about them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_198.wav	3.89	It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_199.wav	3.37	However, this idea is never developed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_200.wav	2.05	It is a farce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_201.wav	2.60	I am totally surprised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_202.wav	2.65	We must keep our feet on the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_203.wav	3.72	However, he said the money had not been wasted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_204.wav	4.48	The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_205.wav	3.59	He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_206.wav	4.53	The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_207.wav	4.01	The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_208.wav	2.01	It's just awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_209.wav	2.52	It's all about money, money, money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_210.wav	2.31	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_211.wav	4.14	We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_212.wav	3.76	We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_213.wav	2.91	We'll have to work hard today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_214.wav	2.01	He knows a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_215.wav	3.29	That is an important part of our role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_216.wav	4.18	Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_217.wav	2.52	I had relied on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_218.wav	2.99	I had decided to quit the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_219.wav	2.82	His third goal was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_220.wav	2.14	It's been a good year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_221.wav	4.44	So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_222.wav	2.05	It's not ideal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_223.wav	3.20	The FBI could become involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_224.wav	4.61	A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_225.wav	3.59	The attacker has been put in foster care.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_226.wav	3.03	His death was a tragic accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_227.wav	4.87	On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_228.wav	3.97	But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_229.wav	3.25	A career as a doctor is on hold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_230.wav	4.36	During the communist time they were very privileged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_231.wav	2.99	Mental health is a massive issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_232.wav	3.12	We played them off the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_233.wav	4.48	Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_234.wav	2.95	Our numbers are small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_235.wav	3.16	They are the innocent victims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_236.wav	2.48	It's like a basketball.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_237.wav	4.10	You should always be able to get out in some direction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_238.wav	3.54	At the time, he was a living legend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_239.wav	2.90	It's the same as Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_240.wav	4.57	Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_241.wav	2.78	It is mainstream.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_242.wav	4.65	Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_243.wav	1.96	We were awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_244.wav	2.22	They had no children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_245.wav	2.91	It is set in Paris.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_246.wav	3.03	It is not the message alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_247.wav	3.12	It's quite a line-up!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_248.wav	2.86	It has been declared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_249.wav	3.76	The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_250.wav	4.31	We have a free vote on these things in our party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_251.wav	2.95	It would appear that it has not been a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_252.wav	1.96	It's only fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_253.wav	4.31	He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_254.wav	3.84	Chambers said he would accept the place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_255.wav	2.52	His body was never found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_256.wav	2.22	There's the mix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_257.wav	4.01	We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_258.wav	2.09	I can't get a job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_259.wav	4.06	He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_260.wav	5.08	For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_261.wav	4.53	That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_262.wav	4.40	However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_263.wav	3.63	It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_264.wav	2.31	I am very angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_265.wav	2.69	They must play for each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_266.wav	2.18	He can do everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_267.wav	4.27	An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_268.wav	4.19	This court has made an order which has not been observed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_269.wav	5.08	The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_270.wav	3.71	He thought he had a month to cross the street.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_271.wav	3.67	It's all change on the music scene in Manchester.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_272.wav	3.16	They want to shut the Scottish Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_273.wav	3.12	This is a question of Islam.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_274.wav	2.95	It looks as though he will be right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_275.wav	2.14	He was popular.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_276.wav	4.36	I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_277.wav	4.57	Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_278.wav	4.27	It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_279.wav	3.59	Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_280.wav	2.35	One knows the feeling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_281.wav	4.23	He promised to lead from the front in battle for entry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_282.wav	3.84	In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_283.wav	4.65	Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_284.wav	3.59	For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_285.wav	2.78	This is a national crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_286.wav	3.03	The death toll included five children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_287.wav	2.69	My body is clearly capable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_288.wav	2.14	So I did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_289.wav	3.38	The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_290.wav	3.63	She said she could not believe that they had run away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_292.wav	3.33	These figures are truly awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_293.wav	3.29	It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_294.wav	4.18	Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_295.wav	3.03	Who can predict?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_296.wav	3.97	If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_297.wav	2.86	A new school will be built.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_298.wav	5.29	I have tonight resigned as member of the European Commission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_299.wav	3.93	Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_300.wav	2.91	Graeme was prepared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_301.wav	4.61	In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_302.wav	4.10	He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_303.wav	3.03	Our task is to complete the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_304.wav	2.56	they fail to engage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_305.wav	4.61	Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_306.wav	3.16	The company yesterday refused to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_307.wav	5.04	The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_308.wav	2.39	It's certainly different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_309.wav	3.72	Is there on his hands?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_310.wav	3.20	We have got no money to go anywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_311.wav	3.29	It's about my time as a guitarist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_312.wav	4.65	There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_313.wav	3.25	I never thought it would take this long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_314.wav	2.90	In fact, they have the opposite effect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_315.wav	3.50	The election is total confusion and chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_316.wav	3.03	Henman has been warned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_317.wav	4.31	It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_318.wav	4.01	I asked for a positive response and I was given one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_319.wav	4.02	For the moment, our position remains the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_320.wav	3.72	Referees are easy targets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_321.wav	3.16	There was some merit in that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_322.wav	2.91	I came into this world with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_323.wav	2.69	That's the law of the land.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_324.wav	2.52	They will be destroyed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_325.wav	2.09	It is a strong case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_326.wav	3.29	My view has now completely changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_327.wav	3.20	The police have to act to help them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_328.wav	3.03	We agreed to disagree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_329.wav	5.50	On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_330.wav	2.65	It could have gone either way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_331.wav	3.25	It is a time bomb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_332.wav	2.78	I'd like to take the plunge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_333.wav	2.27	It can be halted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_334.wav	4.78	Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_335.wav	2.39	They haven't got a hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_336.wav	4.57	Gaelic provision continued to be good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_337.wav	3.97	That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_338.wav	5.21	The Scottish Prison Service said it could not comment on the visit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_339.wav	3.12	Today, we begin to answer that question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_340.wav	1.92	Look at the witnesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_341.wav	2.56	Nobody else was with me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_342.wav	4.66	A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_343.wav	3.76	That is the very reason why it was so vital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_344.wav	4.10	In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_345.wav	2.82	This is a friendly match?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_346.wav	3.63	I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_347.wav	4.95	Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_348.wav	4.40	On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_349.wav	2.69	That is a break with tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_350.wav	2.14	I kept going for her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_351.wav	4.48	The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_352.wav	2.61	He's very explosive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_353.wav	3.25	I was in the train station overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_354.wav	2.69	It benefits the whole family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_355.wav	2.05	It was one in the afternoon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_356.wav	4.40	To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_357.wav	2.60	We will be homeless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_358.wav	2.65	It was fit for royalty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_359.wav	3.16	We are looking for perfection.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_360.wav	4.05	It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_361.wav	4.40	Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_362.wav	3.46	I have got a wife to feed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_363.wav	3.84	I wanted to help the poor people in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_364.wav	2.86	Not so, it seems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_365.wav	2.78	Tell it like it was?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_366.wav	3.67	For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_367.wav	4.95	Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_368.wav	3.80	He put some colour into Scottish history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_369.wav	3.46	I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_370.wav	4.10	They received a reply from their own managers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_371.wav	3.93	By that time, however, it was already too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_372.wav	4.74	Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_373.wav	2.65	It's a long process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_374.wav	3.42	Not because they want to sing about something.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_375.wav	4.06	He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_376.wav	2.77	Colour was at the core of his life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_377.wav	3.88	He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_378.wav	3.46	It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_379.wav	3.55	Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_380.wav	2.48	The casualties were not named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p255\p255_381.wav	4.27	I looked again at its vision for a Scottish Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_001.wav	2.74	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_002.wav	4.52	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_003.wav	7.68	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_004.wav	6.57	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_005.wav	7.94	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_006.wav	6.79	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_007.wav	6.14	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_008.wav	8.58	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_009.wav	6.19	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_010.wav	4.23	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_011.wav	8.66	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_012.wav	6.19	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_013.wav	5.76	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_014.wav	7.00	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_015.wav	7.34	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_016.wav	7.60	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_017.wav	4.74	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_018.wav	6.49	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_019.wav	8.75	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_020.wav	5.93	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_021.wav	10.75	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_022.wav	7.21	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_023.wav	13.95	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_024.wav	9.22	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_025.wav	6.19	It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_026.wav	6.23	We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_027.wav	2.95	I have a theory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_028.wav	5.21	Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_029.wav	3.67	There's a story, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_030.wav	3.12	I was an athlete.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_031.wav	6.79	Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_032.wav	5.38	They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_033.wav	4.99	Then, suddenly, they weren't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_034.wav	4.78	A web site is planned for November.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_035.wav	5.47	It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_036.wav	6.87	Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_037.wav	6.27	At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_038.wav	3.50	They're just different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_039.wav	3.84	It's a real threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_040.wav	6.36	Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_041.wav	4.52	It had been played at festivals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_042.wav	4.83	Indeed, he does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_043.wav	4.86	She is believed to be in South Africa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_044.wav	4.36	This film will be totally awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_045.wav	4.69	No meaningful response was issued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_046.wav	3.37	That period was a struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_047.wav	2.90	A neighbour said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_048.wav	3.42	It's a crucial award.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_049.wav	5.08	It is difficult for Ali.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_050.wav	4.31	It's a blessing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_051.wav	4.27	Is a drug dealer?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_052.wav	5.38	It has been a horrible, horrible time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_053.wav	4.65	I would love to have him home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_054.wav	6.75	No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_055.wav	4.14	He had no enemies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_056.wav	3.29	Sadly, it can't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_057.wav	5.89	There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_058.wav	2.99	It is unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_059.wav	7.21	It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_060.wav	3.29	That's the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_061.wav	5.00	That is very hard, alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_062.wav	6.83	In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_063.wav	6.57	The problems are a result of that shortfall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_064.wav	4.99	And a film maker was born.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_065.wav	4.10	It's a matter of balance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_066.wav	7.56	The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_067.wav	8.41	George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_068.wav	5.55	They may yet have the last laugh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_069.wav	3.76	There was a battle there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_070.wav	2.82	They are real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_071.wav	7.81	There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_072.wav	7.08	I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_073.wav	4.65	It should be devolved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_074.wav	5.59	Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_075.wav	4.52	I was as strong as a horse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_076.wav	10.37	Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_077.wav	5.08	The girls are so lucky to be alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_078.wav	4.48	IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_079.wav	8.24	The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_080.wav	3.59	It is a terrible place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_081.wav	3.24	I've got the shirt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_082.wav	3.25	This is the way things should be handled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_083.wav	7.51	It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_084.wav	6.96	It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_085.wav	5.29	It may well have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_086.wav	4.74	I first met him last summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_087.wav	5.76	Last week, he was taken into hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_088.wav	5.17	He seems to be pleased with the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_089.wav	2.99	It's never too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_090.wav	2.99	It was nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_091.wav	7.09	We do not get that impression now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_092.wav	6.70	The city council is a major property owner in the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_093.wav	6.66	That will come after the game on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_094.wav	5.13	A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_095.wav	3.97	We must look forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_096.wav	7.04	I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_097.wav	4.48	They've got to account for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_098.wav	3.93	She told The Herald.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_099.wav	2.69	It was clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_100.wav	4.19	There was no rescue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_101.wav	4.23	We could not get any possession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_102.wav	3.07	They are now divorced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_103.wav	6.36	The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_104.wav	4.18	Journalists should make him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_105.wav	8.96	A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_106.wav	3.50	Get to know him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_107.wav	3.42	But it was a pleasure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_108.wav	4.69	We have every respect for Michelle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_109.wav	6.32	But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_110.wav	4.44	I didn't play well last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_111.wav	4.36	Before the game we went for a pint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_112.wav	4.40	They will want to perform well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_113.wav	3.03	It's not perfect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_114.wav	3.41	It was the eighties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_115.wav	3.46	They were behind the wheel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_116.wav	3.46	This is a step backwards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_117.wav	2.35	It was ugly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_118.wav	6.36	It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_119.wav	3.80	I joined a group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_120.wav	2.90	It is rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_121.wav	4.14	Who would be a referee?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_122.wav	7.34	That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_123.wav	5.85	There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_124.wav	6.15	The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_125.wav	6.87	We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_126.wav	5.47	There were no grounds for his action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_127.wav	6.87	Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_128.wav	4.95	Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_129.wav	6.87	His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_130.wav	4.86	They keep the atmosphere in mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_131.wav	5.98	Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_132.wav	5.59	Well, you can have a tree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_133.wav	3.42	Who will attend?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_134.wav	6.79	Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_135.wav	7.04	The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_136.wav	3.93	Our intentions are real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_137.wav	4.74	It is also well received.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_138.wav	8.15	We never said that we would walk through the third division.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_139.wav	6.83	Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_140.wav	5.81	It was very frightened and dirty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_141.wav	5.04	We want to keep the pound.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_142.wav	7.73	And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_143.wav	5.59	The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_144.wav	3.80	It changed my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_145.wav	8.28	Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_146.wav	4.70	It is not just about pay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_147.wav	4.48	The home side didn't stand a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_148.wav	3.25	I was so nervous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_149.wav	6.92	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_150.wav	3.63	They have not been named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_151.wav	4.18	There's a sense of excess in the novel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_152.wav	6.53	We should be clear about the role of government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_153.wav	4.31	It was by the numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_154.wav	7.73	She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_155.wav	4.53	We will turn the corner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_156.wav	6.36	This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_157.wav	3.76	He can do no wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_158.wav	4.82	Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_159.wav	4.27	These days are long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_160.wav	3.20	I will tell you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_161.wav	6.74	A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_162.wav	4.44	It has to be now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_163.wav	3.20	We have to move forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_164.wav	4.82	They are not advertised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_165.wav	5.00	We knew we had the goal we wanted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_166.wav	9.86	It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_167.wav	7.47	By then, however, both men were already in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_168.wav	7.81	Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_169.wav	4.18	The post will be unpaid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_170.wav	4.19	Does that put pressure on us?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_171.wav	6.19	Waiting times for these services are too long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_172.wav	4.70	It is too much for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_173.wav	4.78	We've made a couple of albums.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_174.wav	7.77	It is not either national standards or local control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_175.wav	5.59	If that's the case, he will struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_176.wav	4.78	The hotel was now for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_177.wav	7.89	The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_178.wav	3.08	They took a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_179.wav	7.47	I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_180.wav	6.11	There is no point in looking any further.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_181.wav	3.29	Nothing is safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_182.wav	4.23	They will run a mile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_183.wav	3.93	Four policemen were wounded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_184.wav	5.51	They receive a high profile in the media.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_185.wav	4.35	We did everything by the book.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_186.wav	4.10	They need to look after themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_187.wav	5.81	I saw military vehicles in the distance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_188.wav	6.61	My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_189.wav	3.72	It is a terrible loss.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_190.wav	5.55	Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_191.wav	4.78	If the director is with you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_192.wav	4.06	I am totally surprised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_193.wav	4.36	I grew up listening to these people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_194.wav	6.57	The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_195.wav	6.45	Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_196.wav	5.34	It is a case of taking a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_197.wav	4.78	I wanted to put myself on the line.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_198.wav	5.25	It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_199.wav	4.02	People acted too quickly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_200.wav	3.16	I have a cold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_201.wav	7.60	The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_202.wav	4.06	Tommy is not a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_203.wav	7.55	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_204.wav	4.74	They've got three-quarters of the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_205.wav	3.20	But she might be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_206.wav	4.01	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_207.wav	5.16	After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_208.wav	3.38	It's like a garage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_209.wav	4.06	But I am a worried man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_210.wav	4.31	HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_211.wav	4.06	She should not be blamed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_212.wav	5.12	It had all been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_213.wav	7.68	The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_214.wav	4.48	The FBI could become involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_215.wav	8.41	A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_216.wav	7.90	The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_217.wav	7.60	On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_218.wav	7.13	The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_219.wav	3.59	We've got the bronze.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_220.wav	3.84	It's so special.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_221.wav	3.76	We will be victorious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_222.wav	5.08	He seemed to lose his focus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_223.wav	9.95	At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_224.wav	4.87	If it doesn't, it doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_225.wav	4.10	I am immensely sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_226.wav	3.72	It is a gamble.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_227.wav	4.06	My neighbours are horrified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_228.wav	5.68	The track is currently covered in snow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_229.wav	7.89	I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_230.wav	4.10	They are the innocent victims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_231.wav	6.66	My wife and family are the support system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_232.wav	4.61	The body follows the mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_233.wav	4.48	It is set in Paris.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_234.wav	2.90	It's quite nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_235.wav	4.27	It's a lovely, lovely film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_236.wav	6.74	A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_237.wav	7.68	However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_238.wav	7.39	The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_239.wav	5.00	He was good, but not that good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_240.wav	5.76	He claimed the government had lost the plot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_241.wav	7.98	Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_242.wav	6.11	It would appear that it has not been a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_243.wav	4.10	It is hard won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_244.wav	6.91	He says that he is no different from any other man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_245.wav	4.36	The scene is about this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_246.wav	6.23	Some families have even requested to leave the city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_247.wav	8.45	We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_248.wav	7.56	In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_249.wav	6.87	I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_250.wav	2.52	It was a hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_251.wav	5.30	There will be widespread support on all sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_252.wav	5.00	Her presence was almost everywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_253.wav	5.64	I was never going to play against Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_254.wav	6.27	At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_255.wav	7.21	That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_256.wav	5.76	The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_257.wav	4.57	Chelsea was a great club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_258.wav	7.47	That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_259.wav	7.68	One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_260.wav	6.10	It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_261.wav	5.34	Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_262.wav	3.67	I am very angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_263.wav	7.51	The pensioners did not want to know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_264.wav	7.56	I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_265.wav	7.38	He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_266.wav	8.54	Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_267.wav	5.72	That's the only thing I will say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_268.wav	4.99	It looks as though he will be right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_269.wav	5.25	Of course, that is not the whole story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_270.wav	9.26	He has not created a Festival resource.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_271.wav	6.53	Frankly, we should all have such problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_272.wav	5.29	It was an easy decision to come here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_273.wav	5.25	And Michael was just great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_274.wav	7.39	She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_275.wav	8.84	The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_276.wav	3.59	I am an estate agent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_277.wav	5.85	They were on holiday in Egypt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_278.wav	7.55	In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_279.wav	4.31	It happens from time to time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_280.wav	6.23	For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_281.wav	4.95	But I've won both ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_282.wav	5.21	I saw it at a ruck.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_283.wav	5.12	The attacker died in the crash.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_284.wav	7.34	The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_285.wav	4.27	It's like a high school play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_286.wav	4.44	Scotland were beaten again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_287.wav	2.86	It's very safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_288.wav	4.74	He was obviously very genuine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_289.wav	7.77	She said she could not believe that they had run away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_290.wav	6.19	It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_291.wav	6.02	He wrote the letter two days before he died.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_292.wav	7.22	The results are sometimes contentious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_293.wav	5.29	The songs are just so good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_294.wav	7.17	Who can predict?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_295.wav	7.17	They are a total disgrace to the loyalist cause.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_296.wav	4.82	It became a book by itself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_297.wav	5.29	The home was now under new management.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_298.wav	5.29	I thought it was my only chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_300.wav	2.73	One was a lawyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_301.wav	4.95	Our task is to complete the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_302.wav	3.80	The party lasted all night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_303.wav	3.71	It's so awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_304.wav	3.33	It's just not funny!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_305.wav	8.02	It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_306.wav	7.34	Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_307.wav	4.70	It is no surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_308.wav	5.81	Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_309.wav	6.02	O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_310.wav	5.38	We have waited a long time for this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_311.wav	4.87	This is the culture change in medicine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_312.wav	9.00	and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_313.wav	7.47	This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_314.wav	5.04	It is all credit to them today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_315.wav	3.42	They were fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_316.wav	5.85	There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_317.wav	3.42	She is very distinctive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_318.wav	3.54	It's not even finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_319.wav	4.14	Henman has been warned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p256\p256_320.wav	4.23	It should be equal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_001.wav	2.22	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_002.wav	2.95	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_003.wav	5.93	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_004.wav	3.63	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_005.wav	4.69	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_006.wav	4.65	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_007.wav	3.63	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_008.wav	5.89	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_009.wav	3.67	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_010.wav	2.52	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_011.wav	5.34	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_012.wav	3.80	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_013.wav	3.46	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_014.wav	3.84	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_015.wav	4.78	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_016.wav	5.68	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_017.wav	3.20	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_018.wav	4.74	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_019.wav	5.76	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_020.wav	3.76	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_021.wav	6.62	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_022.wav	5.47	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_023.wav	8.66	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_024.wav	5.34	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_025.wav	3.20	We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_026.wav	1.84	Is this accurate?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_027.wav	3.29	They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_028.wav	1.84	Because we do not need it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_029.wav	2.27	Life was like a timetable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_030.wav	3.29	Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_031.wav	1.32	It was clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_032.wav	3.29	Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_033.wav	1.88	I came to complete.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_034.wav	2.01	President Bush is at war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_035.wav	3.46	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_036.wav	1.80	I was scared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_037.wav	1.46	It was ugly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_038.wav	3.50	It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_039.wav	2.86	It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_040.wav	2.82	The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_041.wav	1.71	A neighbour said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_042.wav	1.84	We need to chat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_043.wav	2.14	The boy is no longer with us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_044.wav	1.79	I hate the word.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_045.wav	1.63	That should do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_046.wav	1.54	It's a blessing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_047.wav	2.86	The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_048.wav	1.75	As she explains.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_049.wav	3.29	Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_050.wav	1.92	He had no enemies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_051.wav	2.90	I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_052.wav	2.18	But the law is very clear on this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_053.wav	2.69	For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_054.wav	2.31	We were surprised to see the photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_055.wav	2.65	Next league matches Celtic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_056.wav	1.58	It's very odd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_057.wav	3.12	The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_058.wav	2.05	It is not great art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_059.wav	4.06	George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_060.wav	1.71	There was a battle there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_061.wav	2.14	Scotland had great assets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_062.wav	2.69	There will be tough opponents to this report.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_063.wav	2.13	Have a look at our accounts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_064.wav	2.22	Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_065.wav	2.82	There is an element of racism in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_066.wav	3.25	I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_067.wav	1.79	It's all I can do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_068.wav	2.09	There could be a way back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_069.wav	2.99	They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_070.wav	2.48	The price cuts are really exciting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_071.wav	3.89	Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_072.wav	1.92	I had my suspicions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_073.wav	2.52	She died in hospital two hours later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_074.wav	1.75	It was chaotic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_075.wav	2.01	Is there a new way forward?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_076.wav	1.75	I've not thought about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_077.wav	2.18	People must remain vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_078.wav	3.33	Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_079.wav	3.03	It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_080.wav	3.71	It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_081.wav	2.05	It may well have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_082.wav	3.12	He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_083.wav	2.27	He seems to be pleased with the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_084.wav	3.03	Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_085.wav	2.78	I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_086.wav	1.66	It's never too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_087.wav	2.74	Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_088.wav	3.46	Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_089.wav	3.12	Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_090.wav	1.97	Today I couldn't run on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_091.wav	1.96	We must look forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_092.wav	2.86	It is an old family habit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_093.wav	1.75	He was possessed
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_094.wav	2.44	She told The Herald.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_095.wav	3.67	Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_096.wav	2.78	The peace process will be buried!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_097.wav	2.86	The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_098.wav	2.18	They are now divorced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_099.wav	2.82	They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_100.wav	1.49	It was mayhem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_101.wav	4.35	However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_102.wav	2.69	Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_103.wav	2.05	We have every respect for Michelle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_104.wav	2.60	That time is not now, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_105.wav	1.97	I didn't play well last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_106.wav	2.69	For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_107.wav	1.92	They will want to perform well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_108.wav	2.26	They had to be cut from the wreckage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_109.wav	2.26	I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_110.wav	1.67	It is normal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_111.wav	2.56	I was fighting for my life, I thought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_112.wav	2.13	I don't have many friends.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_113.wav	1.71	It's a shame.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_114.wav	1.62	It was the eighties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_115.wav	2.22	We do not expect any surplus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_116.wav	3.37	Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_117.wav	2.57	It's not a new concept in jazz.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_118.wav	3.76	We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_119.wav	1.97	I'm delighted about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_120.wav	1.41	Does this mean.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_121.wav	3.63	This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_122.wav	1.54	He did his job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_123.wav	2.31	You can spend money on housing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_124.wav	1.75	That's all right then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_125.wav	1.97	I was furious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_126.wav	2.35	It has removed a bit of guilt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_127.wav	3.72	His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_128.wav	2.82	It's terrible that he has died the same way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_129.wav	2.86	So the European elections are extremely important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_130.wav	3.50	Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_131.wav	1.58	Who will attend?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_132.wav	3.20	The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_133.wav	2.65	The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_134.wav	1.54	I am now unemployed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_135.wav	3.67	Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_136.wav	2.52	They made such decisions in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_137.wav	2.05	Our intentions are real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_138.wav	2.77	It is also well received.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_139.wav	1.79	What will happen then?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_140.wav	1.92	It's not true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_141.wav	2.18	I feel very grateful with everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_142.wav	3.89	We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_143.wav	2.52	Nobody in the world can get away from him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_144.wav	2.95	He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_145.wav	3.63	We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_146.wav	2.05	There is a lack of chemistry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_147.wav	3.20	That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_148.wav	2.05	It is like a football team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_149.wav	2.82	That group reported just before Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_150.wav	2.22	He will emerge as a world leader.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_151.wav	2.44	It opens the door to the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_152.wav	1.58	They did very well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_153.wav	2.18	It became a book by itself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_154.wav	3.46	But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_155.wav	2.13	The weather forecast isn't good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_156.wav	2.39	There's a sense of excess in the novel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_157.wav	3.24	For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_158.wav	1.46	There's a pause.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_159.wav	1.79	He can do no wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_160.wav	2.52	It was so new, so exciting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_161.wav	2.22	I've learned from my mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_162.wav	3.12	A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_163.wav	2.48	I've put my own money into this project.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_164.wav	3.72	However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_165.wav	1.79	I lost my head.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_166.wav	2.48	You are not going in blind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_167.wav	3.16	Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_168.wav	3.29	As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_169.wav	2.78	And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_170.wav	2.26	My life has been destroyed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_171.wav	2.05	There was no hint of scandal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_172.wav	2.39	Treatment is not an issue with these people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_173.wav	2.44	I feel like my game has come a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_174.wav	2.39	We wanted it left for a wee while.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_175.wav	3.46	However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_176.wav	1.96	It's quite a routine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_177.wav	2.82	There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_178.wav	3.37	In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_179.wav	2.01	Everyone can be bought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_180.wav	2.69	It is minute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_181.wav	2.44	They need to look after themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_182.wav	2.56	What has caused the demise of singing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_183.wav	1.75	One was a lawyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_184.wav	3.29	My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_185.wav	2.31	It was an odd affair, in many respects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_186.wav	4.10	Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_187.wav	1.79	Saturday is gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_188.wav	3.16	I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_189.wav	2.30	Last night was a key episode.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_190.wav	2.27	We must keep our feet on the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_191.wav	3.12	The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_192.wav	1.63	Off I went.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_193.wav	2.69	There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_194.wav	2.69	He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_195.wav	2.05	Ferguson should take note.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_196.wav	3.29	The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_197.wav	1.75	It's just awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_198.wav	3.29	We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_199.wav	4.23	IT S all in the hair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_200.wav	2.61	We have an election in eight days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_201.wav	2.31	But I am a worried man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_202.wav	3.46	This gives a financial incentive to switch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_203.wav	2.05	Saddam Hussein is a devil.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_204.wav	1.67	He knows a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_205.wav	2.31	He is slightly confused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_206.wav	3.12	Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_207.wav	3.80	We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_208.wav	1.92	I am delighted for Simon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_209.wav	2.14	It had all been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_210.wav	2.52	A Grampian Police spokesman said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_211.wav	2.13	We have got to get it right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_212.wav	2.69	However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_213.wav	1.71	I might come back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_214.wav	2.61	His death was a tragic accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_215.wav	2.26	It's just a place to open it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_216.wav	3.42	He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_217.wav	2.91	Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_218.wav	2.48	William Hague delighted his party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_219.wav	3.37	At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_220.wav	2.01	We played them off the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_221.wav	2.18	She really suffered for her art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_222.wav	2.39	He demanded to speak to the boss.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_223.wav	4.48	Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_224.wav	3.07	Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_225.wav	2.35	I think he's the favourite, no question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_226.wav	2.26	Broke the birdie record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_227.wav	1.75	They had no children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_228.wav	1.62	It is set in Paris.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_229.wav	2.39	Well, they were the unlucky ones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_230.wav	3.33	The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_231.wav	3.46	On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_232.wav	3.89	John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, will fly to the summit tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_233.wav	2.39	But it's a subtle process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_234.wav	3.67	The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_235.wav	2.43	My future is in the marathon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_236.wav	3.59	Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_237.wav	3.55	A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_238.wav	2.26	They may yet have the last laugh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_239.wav	2.14	You can feel at home in China.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_240.wav	3.63	It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_241.wav	1.75	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_242.wav	3.24	We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_243.wav	2.35	I didn't need to watch it on the video.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_244.wav	2.78	He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_245.wav	3.03	I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_246.wav	2.95	We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_247.wav	3.16	He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_248.wav	3.29	He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_249.wav	1.62	I watched a game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_250.wav	2.86	They are interior designers and architects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_251.wav	3.50	There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_252.wav	2.14	they fail to engage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_253.wav	2.99	It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_254.wav	2.69	I would have the hammer in the crowd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_255.wav	2.90	He thought he had a month to cross the street.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_256.wav	3.46	He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_257.wav	2.09	Blood samples were taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_258.wav	4.10	He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_259.wav	1.58	It's very nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_260.wav	2.99	Frankly, we should all have such problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_261.wav	2.73	Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_262.wav	3.46	We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_263.wav	2.05	And Michael was just great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_264.wav	1.41	We're in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_265.wav	2.95	Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_266.wav	2.69	Our objective is to tackle poverty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_267.wav	1.88	One knows the feeling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_268.wav	2.82	She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_269.wav	1.79	She looked so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_270.wav	2.73	It was a privilege to work for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_271.wav	3.03	For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_272.wav	1.97	He looked very sharp.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_273.wav	2.22	You've got to have both sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_274.wav	1.92	Who did the recruiting?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_275.wav	3.29	Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_276.wav	2.31	Well, he can do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_277.wav	2.82	It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_278.wav	3.37	It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_279.wav	3.93	He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_280.wav	2.56	The results are sometimes contentious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_281.wav	1.45	He should have won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_282.wav	1.96	A new school will be built.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_283.wav	3.20	Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_284.wav	3.85	That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_285.wav	1.71	What has altered?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_286.wav	2.78	The home was now under new management.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_287.wav	2.09	Graeme was prepared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_288.wav	2.99	I thought it was my only chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_289.wav	3.25	However, the snow was welcomed by some.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_290.wav	2.69	It just came into my head that day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_291.wav	1.75	They are wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_292.wav	2.99	Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_293.wav	2.35	It's just not funny!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_294.wav	2.14	I am very happy to be here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_295.wav	1.71	The plot is minimal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_296.wav	3.46	It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_297.wav	3.54	A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_298.wav	2.78	This is the culture change in medicine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_299.wav	3.80	and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_300.wav	1.67	They were fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_301.wav	2.61	I never thought it would take this long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_302.wav	2.30	In fact, they have the opposite effect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_303.wav	2.01	They wanted the club to make money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_304.wav	1.75	Kids are terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_305.wav	2.09	Henman has been warned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_306.wav	1.67	It should be equal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_307.wav	3.80	Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_308.wav	2.57	The home team had an amazing start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_309.wav	1.71	It is out there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_310.wav	1.67	They had a confession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_311.wav	2.78	Davis is very supportive, as a director.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_312.wav	1.84	We are in the end game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_313.wav	2.65	I came into this world with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_314.wav	3.54	But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_315.wav	1.67	I am so upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_316.wav	1.84	The boat was fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_317.wav	1.75	I saw some good things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_318.wav	2.48	Finally, he paid for the movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_319.wav	3.03	You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_320.wav	3.03	In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_321.wav	1.97	Three years ago he would have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_322.wav	1.88	You feel the pride.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_323.wav	1.97	It is so unfair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_324.wav	3.63	The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_325.wav	2.09	Indeed, it was magical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_326.wav	1.80	I've got no secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_327.wav	1.62	Look at the witnesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_328.wav	1.45	I'm very lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_329.wav	1.58	We must do something.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_330.wav	2.99	He says that he is no different from any other man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_331.wav	2.18	Alex Ferguson is the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_332.wav	2.90	I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_333.wav	2.39	Like his acting, it was an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_334.wav	2.52	It is not like working for a living.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_335.wav	1.58	It is long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_336.wav	3.37	The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_337.wav	2.39	Tell us about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_338.wav	2.65	The salary changes are long overdue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_339.wav	3.54	He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_340.wav	1.88	It was very formal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_341.wav	2.48	The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_342.wav	2.14	Tyson is overwhelmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_343.wav	3.03	We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_344.wav	2.01	I wanted to go out on a high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_345.wav	2.95	Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_346.wav	2.60	I felt really good until Friday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_347.wav	3.29	His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_348.wav	2.22	He could face a jail sentence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_349.wav	2.78	For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_350.wav	2.91	I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_351.wav	2.91	I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_352.wav	2.43	Then followed a bout of flu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_353.wav	1.75	There is no signature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_354.wav	2.05	It's a long process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_355.wav	2.09	It is a large number.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_356.wav	2.31	He knew his job inside out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_357.wav	2.27	I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_358.wav	4.06	Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_359.wav	2.69	It does not even have a staff shortage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_360.wav	3.29	I haven't had a kick at a Celtic player for a while.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_361.wav	1.54	He has the edge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_362.wav	1.92	He denied the charge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_363.wav	2.18	There were no casualties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_364.wav	3.37	Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_365.wav	2.35	YOU thought it was a headache.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_366.wav	3.59	Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_367.wav	3.41	A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_368.wav	2.14	They really did a great job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_369.wav	2.43	There is a solution, she believes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_370.wav	2.31	However, it's good to turn the page.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_371.wav	1.71	This year I understood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_372.wav	2.01	I'm pleased about one thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_373.wav	1.41	It is unusual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_374.wav	2.99	It is also claimed that he was murdered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_375.wav	3.24	It is likely the rest of the market will follow suit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_376.wav	2.48	I can lead by example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_377.wav	2.69	Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_378.wav	1.80	They are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_379.wav	3.80	He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_380.wav	2.22	My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_381.wav	3.25	So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_382.wav	1.88	It was on fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_383.wav	3.63	The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_384.wav	2.95	I never won a penny throughout my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_385.wav	2.30	Emotions were complex.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_386.wav	2.18	He's already made history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_387.wav	1.62	So I did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_388.wav	1.75	You ask the question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_389.wav	3.67	Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_390.wav	1.54	There was no trouble.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_391.wav	2.44	This is a huge confidence boost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_392.wav	2.61	Not because they want to sing about something.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_393.wav	2.35	It is not a standing army.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_394.wav	3.20	We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_395.wav	2.44	I believe the gap is nearly there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_396.wav	1.79	You wanted the evidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_397.wav	1.88	Our numbers are small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_398.wav	1.58	I was very young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_399.wav	3.11	We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_400.wav	2.13	I am the Son of Sam.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_401.wav	1.96	She is superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_402.wav	3.20	Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_403.wav	2.35	It doesn't always work that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_404.wav	2.78	It is simple, but profound.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_405.wav	2.09	No preference emerged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_406.wav	2.99	But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_407.wav	2.82	I've invented a village in East Lothian.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_408.wav	2.65	She has reached the top of her profession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_409.wav	1.88	It goes with the job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_410.wav	4.14	The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_411.wav	3.50	Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_412.wav	2.01	I recommend a tour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_413.wav	2.14	We are delighted with this outcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_414.wav	1.97	I have so much respect for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_415.wav	2.18	We shall be victorious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_416.wav	2.39	Rather than answer, she resigned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_417.wav	1.75	War is not the action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_418.wav	3.12	They said so that I would look good in uniform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_419.wav	2.86	It's not about defining styles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_420.wav	1.75	One must hope not!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_421.wav	1.67	It is marvellous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_422.wav	3.59	But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_423.wav	2.22	They should not be blamed for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_424.wav	3.72	Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_425.wav	1.62	It is bizarre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_426.wav	2.48	Mary Archer is almost too clever.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_427.wav	1.96	I was just overwhelmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_428.wav	2.86	It had been in place since last July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_429.wav	1.75	It's a miracle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_430.wav	3.72	The first minister is obviously concerned to hear about this incident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_431.wav	2.73	That was the first time I worked with Richard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_432.wav	2.52	They will form a tribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_433.wav	2.35	The whole region is in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p257\p257_434.wav	2.13	The bill would be massive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_001.wav	1.84	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_002.wav	3.72	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_003.wav	8.20	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_004.wav	5.47	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_005.wav	7.17	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_006.wav	6.15	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_007.wav	4.61	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_008.wav	8.24	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_009.wav	5.81	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_010.wav	3.33	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_011.wav	6.62	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_012.wav	4.69	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_013.wav	4.70	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_014.wav	4.83	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_015.wav	7.64	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_016.wav	6.32	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_017.wav	3.93	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_018.wav	5.97	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_019.wav	6.91	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_020.wav	5.08	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_021.wav	9.05	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_022.wav	7.08	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_023.wav	11.48	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_024.wav	6.83	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_025.wav	2.48	Johnson was pretty low.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_026.wav	1.88	It's nice to hear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_027.wav	3.76	People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_028.wav	1.97	They should be so lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_029.wav	3.12	Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_030.wav	3.59	However, the following year the cancer returned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_031.wav	2.05	Because we do not need it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_032.wav	2.73	He took me on a tour of the wards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_033.wav	5.25	They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_034.wav	3.16	I'd like to continue that record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_035.wav	1.54	It was clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_036.wav	3.08	It is not for any other purpose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_037.wav	2.56	President Bush is at war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_038.wav	1.71	I was scared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_039.wav	1.79	It will come all right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_040.wav	4.36	It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_041.wav	2.09	The judge said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_042.wav	1.92	We need to chat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_043.wav	2.18	It's a blessing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_044.wav	1.71	As she explains.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_045.wav	1.75	She looked so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_046.wav	2.52	He looks like an Afghan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_047.wav	2.09	It is the whole package.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_048.wav	4.31	I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_049.wav	3.50	We were surprised to see the photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_050.wav	1.84	That's the day job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_051.wav	2.39	We have not given up hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_052.wav	3.76	You must have a government and a good civil service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_053.wav	2.95	That is very hard, alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_054.wav	2.35	It's that kind of place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_055.wav	4.95	Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_056.wav	4.44	And if he hadn't become a musician?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_057.wav	2.35	He was popular.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_058.wav	2.22	It should be devolved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_059.wav	3.16	We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_060.wav	1.75	Try to save us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_061.wav	3.42	He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_062.wav	2.44	Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_063.wav	3.76	There is an element of racism in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_064.wav	3.07	That was the easy election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_065.wav	2.18	It's all I can do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_066.wav	2.61	The price cuts are really exciting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_067.wav	4.78	Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_068.wav	3.08	The girls are so lucky to be alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_069.wav	4.57	The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_070.wav	4.05	I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_071.wav	2.05	He got the same story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_072.wav	2.99	This is the way things should be handled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_073.wav	3.71	It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_074.wav	4.10	It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_075.wav	3.76	However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_076.wav	2.43	I first met him last summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_077.wav	2.99	Last week, he was taken into hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_078.wav	2.35	Nothing is yet confirmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_079.wav	4.01	New Zealand rugby is totally different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_080.wav	2.99	We have other options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_081.wav	4.05	Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_082.wav	3.93	The city council is a major property owner in the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_083.wav	2.14	Today I couldn't run on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_084.wav	2.35	They are different types.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_085.wav	2.52	It is a simple equation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_086.wav	3.03	Until you hit the big games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_087.wav	5.63	Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_088.wav	1.80	There was no rescue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_089.wav	1.92	She's got to say something.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_090.wav	4.05	The selection process is still at a very early stage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_091.wav	4.61	Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_092.wav	3.85	Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_093.wav	2.48	Journalists should make him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_094.wav	1.75	But it was a pleasure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_095.wav	3.71	We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_096.wav	3.33	Oil embargo endorsed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_097.wav	2.99	It is a good lifestyle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_098.wav	3.12	Before the game we went for a pint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_099.wav	4.74	Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_100.wav	2.05	It's not perfect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_101.wav	2.52	They had to be cut from the wreckage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_102.wav	2.01	She has been shot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_103.wav	4.70	He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_104.wav	4.40	According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_105.wav	3.12	We do not expect any surplus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_106.wav	4.14	He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_107.wav	2.13	It is so sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_108.wav	4.35	We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_109.wav	2.99	We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_110.wav	2.95	This film will be totally awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_111.wav	2.69	Maybe this battle has been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_112.wav	3.80	Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_113.wav	1.88	I joined a group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_114.wav	3.89	This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_115.wav	2.01	Who would have?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_116.wav	2.56	It is a delight on every level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_117.wav	2.74	You can spend money on housing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_118.wav	2.95	Here, again, they were denied a voice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_119.wav	3.72	Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_120.wav	3.59	There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_121.wav	3.29	I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_122.wav	2.78	It has removed a bit of guilt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_123.wav	2.05	She does not want to speak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_124.wav	3.03	It's terrible that he has died the same way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_125.wav	3.72	So the European elections are extremely important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_126.wav	3.29	Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_127.wav	4.27	Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_128.wav	3.33	Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_129.wav	3.29	The move has provoked a mixed response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_130.wav	2.22	The role was perfect for Russell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_131.wav	3.12	It plans to return to this field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_132.wav	3.24	They made such decisions in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_133.wav	5.00	Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_134.wav	2.52	My conscience is not clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_135.wav	2.73	I am totally devoted to this job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_136.wav	3.16	He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_137.wav	4.19	If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_138.wav	4.69	We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_139.wav	1.92	Is that Titanic?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_140.wav	5.25	He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_141.wav	5.08	Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_142.wav	2.90	It opens the door to the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_143.wav	1.50	You know the type.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_144.wav	3.76	The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_145.wav	2.69	The FBI could become involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_146.wav	2.56	The weather forecast isn't good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_147.wav	3.12	She had gone to the Catholic school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_148.wav	2.10	My Dad is a hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_149.wav	3.67	The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_150.wav	2.48	Neither side can win this war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_151.wav	2.31	Was this element always there?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_152.wav	2.13	These days are long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_153.wav	3.25	I've put my own money into this project.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_154.wav	5.00	They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_155.wav	4.78	Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_156.wav	4.10	They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_157.wav	4.70	Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_158.wav	2.31	We have to move forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_159.wav	4.57	Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_160.wav	2.26	We try to keep it right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_161.wav	2.14	It's that sort of night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_162.wav	2.05	I lost my head.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_163.wav	3.33	It is not too late to get on board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_164.wav	3.89	Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_165.wav	1.84	That will do for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_166.wav	2.57	They thought they had found a home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_167.wav	2.99	I always felt they played for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_168.wav	3.80	Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_169.wav	4.06	First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_170.wav	4.82	IT S the real thing, for sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_171.wav	4.61	However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_172.wav	2.77	If that's the case, he will struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_173.wav	1.67	It should be easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_174.wav	3.63	There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_175.wav	2.09	I drove the ball well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_176.wav	4.61	Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_177.wav	1.50	I've been there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_178.wav	1.79	They will run a mile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_179.wav	2.44	Four policemen were wounded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_180.wav	2.99	They receive a high profile in the media.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_181.wav	2.52	We did everything by the book.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_182.wav	3.08	The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_183.wav	4.70	He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_184.wav	2.82	We want to help them through it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_185.wav	1.92	It is a terrible loss.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_186.wav	4.44	We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_187.wav	3.25	The procedure is the same in all cases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_188.wav	2.56	If the director is with you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_189.wav	2.48	It's very difficult to find a buyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_190.wav	2.56	I grew up listening to these people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_191.wav	3.80	The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_192.wav	3.46	It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_193.wav	4.23	The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_194.wav	2.22	It's the same old story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_195.wav	3.80	It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_196.wav	1.75	Is that success?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_197.wav	2.26	Ferguson should take note.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_198.wav	3.08	They've got three-quarters of the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_199.wav	1.75	But she might be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_200.wav	2.56	A deadline is still essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_201.wav	4.31	We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_202.wav	2.14	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_203.wav	3.20	It's a mixture of everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_204.wav	4.14	After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_205.wav	2.56	We have an election in eight days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_206.wav	3.67	The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_207.wav	1.54	Feel the heat?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_208.wav	1.88	He is slightly confused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_209.wav	2.35	She should not be blamed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_210.wav	3.37	Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_211.wav	2.13	It had all been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_212.wav	2.35	A Grampian Police spokesman said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_213.wav	2.60	His third goal was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_214.wav	1.88	It's not ideal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_215.wav	2.09	We want to keep the pound.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_216.wav	3.46	I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_217.wav	2.39	He seemed to lose his focus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_218.wav	1.88	I might come back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_219.wav	2.35	His death was a tragic accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_220.wav	4.87	On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_221.wav	4.27	He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_222.wav	3.97	Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_223.wav	3.24	It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_224.wav	2.14	It's so special.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_225.wav	3.59	The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_226.wav	2.22	What was the main difference?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_227.wav	4.44	It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_228.wav	4.57	I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_229.wav	2.56	They are the innocent victims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_230.wav	3.33	My wife and family are the support system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_231.wav	3.67	Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_232.wav	2.69	They tried to give her advice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_233.wav	2.09	They had no children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_234.wav	1.92	We are in the hat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_235.wav	1.84	They should come forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_236.wav	2.65	Well, they were the unlucky ones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_237.wav	1.46	It's quite nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_238.wav	2.05	Hospitals are for the ill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_239.wav	3.46	The problem in Norway is outside the National.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_240.wav	5.08	Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_241.wav	2.73	They are all bright and different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_242.wav	1.63	It is hard won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_243.wav	4.91	It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_244.wav	3.97	Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_245.wav	2.61	You can feel at home in China.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_246.wav	4.18	It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_247.wav	3.33	It's a record label, not a form of music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_248.wav	1.46	I was shocked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_249.wav	1.88	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_250.wav	4.02	We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_251.wav	3.16	I didn't need to watch it on the video.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_252.wav	3.63	He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_253.wav	2.69	Her presence was almost everywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_254.wav	3.50	We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_255.wav	4.44	Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_256.wav	3.97	He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_257.wav	3.89	They are interior designers and architects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_258.wav	2.18	Chelsea was a great club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_259.wav	4.02	It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_260.wav	2.52	I was in jail for five years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_261.wav	1.88	I am very angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_262.wav	2.01	They must play for each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_263.wav	4.02	Today we can say that a new era has begun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_264.wav	2.39	It is also very valuable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_265.wav	3.03	He thought he had a month to cross the street.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_266.wav	3.42	It's all change on the music scene in Manchester.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_267.wav	1.84	I saw one body.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_268.wav	2.52	That's the only thing I will say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_269.wav	5.04	Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_270.wav	4.57	The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_271.wav	4.23	Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_272.wav	5.04	Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_273.wav	3.76	Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_274.wav	2.31	It is the same in Sweden.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_275.wav	4.57	Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_276.wav	3.29	Our objective is to tackle poverty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_277.wav	3.80	They were all in a stable condition last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_278.wav	2.09	It's a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_279.wav	3.08	The record companies have gone through the floor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_280.wav	4.14	He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_281.wav	2.48	He has a wealth of experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_282.wav	1.75	It's so awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_283.wav	3.55	For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_284.wav	3.89	I intended to look for another club on loan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_285.wav	3.93	Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_286.wav	2.35	This is a national crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_287.wav	3.29	The death toll included five children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_288.wav	2.65	He was obviously very genuine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_289.wav	3.38	It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_290.wav	2.52	It was deployed in the Gulf War.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_291.wav	2.73	The results are sometimes contentious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_292.wav	2.69	These figures are truly awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_293.wav	2.60	It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_294.wav	3.93	Sunday's game was not a trial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_295.wav	2.22	A new school will be built.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_296.wav	4.40	The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_297.wav	4.14	Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_298.wav	3.21	The home was now under new management.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_299.wav	2.56	Graeme was prepared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_300.wav	5.46	In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_301.wav	1.67	Nothing is safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_302.wav	1.62	One was a lawyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_303.wav	5.38	A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_304.wav	4.48	The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_305.wav	4.14	Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_306.wav	3.07	This is a war over our home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_307.wav	4.14	In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_308.wav	4.52	Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_309.wav	3.71	It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_310.wav	2.05	It's certainly different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_311.wav	4.10	The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_312.wav	1.92	He will go a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_313.wav	3.54	We want to play at the worlds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_314.wav	2.35	Scotland were beaten again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_315.wav	2.05	They were fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_316.wav	4.95	There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_317.wav	1.79	Kids are terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_318.wav	1.75	It should be equal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_319.wav	3.12	The problems began a long time ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_320.wav	2.90	My body is clearly capable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_321.wav	2.52	Referees are easy targets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_322.wav	2.39	He said she was mad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_323.wav	4.14	It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_324.wav	4.14	Davis is very supportive, as a director.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_325.wav	3.16	However, the groups denied the claims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_326.wav	2.78	There was some merit in that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_327.wav	3.03	I came into this world with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_328.wav	2.43	It is a strong case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_329.wav	4.44	They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_330.wav	1.79	Off with their heads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_331.wav	1.88	I am so upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_332.wav	2.86	I'd like to take the plunge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_333.wav	2.78	Robert is a special talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_334.wav	2.78	Finally, he paid for the movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_335.wav	2.18	There was no option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_336.wav	2.27	They haven't got a hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_337.wav	1.63	He did a good job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_338.wav	3.33	I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_339.wav	2.05	It was so new, so exciting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_340.wav	4.87	They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_341.wav	2.31	Indeed, it was magical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_342.wav	2.35	I've got no secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_343.wav	2.31	There's no place to hide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_344.wav	1.96	Tiger is the exception.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_345.wav	2.05	Nobody else was with me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_346.wav	4.14	That is the very reason why it was so vital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_347.wav	3.46	The composer will conduct.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_348.wav	3.42	His contract was then not renewed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_349.wav	2.05	I got a yellow card.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_350.wav	1.92	It is long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_351.wav	2.69	Eight months later, he was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_352.wav	4.40	A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_353.wav	2.18	I saw some good things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_354.wav	3.29	The salary changes are long overdue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_355.wav	4.91	He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_356.wav	4.95	A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_357.wav	1.84	It was very formal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_358.wav	4.18	The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_359.wav	4.95	But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_360.wav	4.44	No other job in world football can compare to this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_361.wav	3.67	Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_362.wav	2.35	We will be homeless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_363.wav	1.71	That would help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_364.wav	2.78	It was fit for royalty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_365.wav	4.31	Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_366.wav	4.53	It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_367.wav	4.10	He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_368.wav	3.07	It's not pretty, but it's effective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_369.wav	1.84	I feel pretty good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_370.wav	1.58	I am a star.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_371.wav	1.71	He could make it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_372.wav	2.39	I thought he was my friend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_373.wav	2.56	He could face a jail sentence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_374.wav	4.70	The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_375.wav	3.29	It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_376.wav	3.12	We knew we had the goal we wanted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_377.wav	3.12	Well, the big day has arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_378.wav	3.84	I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_379.wav	3.03	Not because they want to sing about something.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_380.wav	2.74	Colour was at the core of his life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_381.wav	3.12	Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_382.wav	2.09	It was a cry for help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_383.wav	1.67	Something is wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_384.wav	2.77	It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_385.wav	3.37	It is a temptation which should be resisted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_386.wav	3.54	That team is due to be announced this morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_387.wav	2.65	That's the name of the game, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_388.wav	5.34	However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_389.wav	2.01	I was so nervous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_390.wav	2.69	YOU thought it was a headache.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_391.wav	3.63	There is a solution, she believes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_392.wav	3.12	However, it's good to turn the page.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_393.wav	3.42	One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_394.wav	2.26	This year I understood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_395.wav	4.48	Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_396.wav	1.71	I suspect the latter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_397.wav	2.31	These guys are looking for business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_398.wav	2.18	He is on the wrong side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_399.wav	3.07	It was a breathtaking moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_400.wav	2.77	The car was just there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_401.wav	3.58	But, in fact, the reverse is true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_402.wav	1.84	It is full-scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_403.wav	2.82	My house was shaking at the time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_404.wav	2.56	Then , he laughs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_405.wav	1.96	They are not left wing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_406.wav	4.18	A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_407.wav	3.46	We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_408.wav	2.01	He scored a touchdown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_409.wav	3.97	The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_410.wav	4.05	Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_411.wav	2.82	I believe the gap is nearly there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_412.wav	3.97	Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_413.wav	4.48	Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p258\p258_414.wav	2.99	Also, it is the season of goodwill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_001.wav	2.14	Please call Stella.  )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_002.wav	3.84	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_003.wav	8.15	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_004.wav	4.95	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_005.wav	7.43	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_006.wav	6.44	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_007.wav	4.74	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_008.wav	8.32	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_009.wav	6.32	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_010.wav	3.12	People look, but no one ever finds it. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_011.wav	7.85	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_012.wav	5.12	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_013.wav	4.65	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_014.wav	4.82	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_015.wav	7.00	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_016.wav	7.38	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_017.wav	4.99	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_018.wav	7.30	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_019.wav	7.43	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_020.wav	5.42	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_021.wav	9.95	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_022.wav	7.13	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_023.wav	11.44	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_024.wav	7.13	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_025.wav	3.07	But it could prove disastrous.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_026.wav	3.12	Smoking is also very important.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_027.wav	4.35	Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_028.wav	3.38	I am pretty careful with money.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_029.wav	3.12	He has the courage of the unaware.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_030.wav	2.65	I could not do it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_031.wav	2.78	Everyone can have their opinion.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_032.wav	3.93	The function of the clerk is to provide advice.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_033.wav	2.99	We speak about the performance.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_034.wav	3.84	She is employed on short-term contracts.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_035.wav	2.61	Because he was born in England.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_036.wav	4.70	They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_037.wav	3.07	Child benefit will not be affected.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_038.wav	4.57	It all started with a visiting rugby club.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_039.wav	3.55	I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_040.wav	3.97	Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_041.wav	2.91	It carried a double message.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_042.wav	3.54	You must always attempt to raise the bar.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_043.wav	4.14	Several investments have already been made.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_044.wav	3.16	The boy is no longer with us.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_045.wav	4.14	Among them are many criminals.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_046.wav	3.54	Merger would be entirely logical.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_047.wav	2.78	He looks like an Afghan.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_048.wav	2.61	They had to explain it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_049.wav	3.20	I had come back from London.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_050.wav	3.80	Pulled a huge number of viewers.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_051.wav	2.99	I had trouble with the producers.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_052.wav	4.06	Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_053.wav	2.65	We have not given up hope.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_054.wav	3.84	In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_055.wav	3.67	The problems are a result of that shortfall.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_056.wav	3.46	They had been in Scotland on exercise.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_057.wav	2.43	Let's hope that it does.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_058.wav	3.08	We have to keep our clients.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_059.wav	3.21	He also has a Scottish grandfather.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_060.wav	4.61	The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_061.wav	3.03	The Farmer wants a new campaign.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_062.wav	2.95	He hadn't had them for a long time.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_063.wav	2.99	Only water is currently allowed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_064.wav	2.73	It wasn't possible to relax.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_065.wav	4.10	We should keep this recent assault in perspective.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_066.wav	5.08	Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_067.wav	2.90	She died in hospital two hours later.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_068.wav	3.03	It is a job creation scheme.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_069.wav	4.53	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_070.wav	2.52	Even the one she loved.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_071.wav	2.78	Today it was really enjoyable.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_072.wav	3.97	Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_073.wav	3.12	It was a unanimous decision.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_074.wav	3.12	It makes for an interesting conference.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_075.wav	3.71	I've had it for the exams.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_076.wav	2.52	I first met him last summer.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_077.wav	3.08	I wanted to change the formula.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_078.wav	3.07	It gave no further details.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_079.wav	3.50	Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_080.wav	2.44	Our mother is very worried.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_081.wav	2.69	Potions said he would drive.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_082.wav	4.35	The city council is a major property owner in the area.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_083.wav	4.14	William Hague, the guest of honour, was delighted.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_084.wav	2.86	It is normal for me.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_085.wav	3.97	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_086.wav	2.01	How are you, sir ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_087.wav	3.29	So is that it, then ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_088.wav	3.37	Do I have a favourite ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_089.wav	2.78	What do we do ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_090.wav	2.65	Why do it otherwise ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_091.wav	3.38	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_092.wav	3.97	Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_093.wav	5.17	The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_094.wav	5.59	Collaboration is also encouraged by the Medical Research Council and other bodies.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_095.wav	4.18	The allegations were still under investigation, he added.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_096.wav	3.29	We would have concerns about that.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_097.wav	3.03	Ferguson must take the blame.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_098.wav	3.54	Figures are not relevant to the strategy.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_099.wav	4.36	He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_100.wav	2.43	It was clear on Thursday.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_101.wav	2.52	I did not have a bet on myself.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_102.wav	4.31	The selection process is still at a very early stage.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_103.wav	2.52	It's good to have a voice.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_104.wav	3.46	They will remember this victory for a while.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_105.wav	3.20	But they must believe in themselves.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_106.wav	3.63	We haven't finished the complaints procedure.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_107.wav	3.37	The following are the principal provisions.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_108.wav	2.52	It is a good lifestyle.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_109.wav	3.37	We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_110.wav	3.50	While they went on holiday, we got the contract.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_111.wav	4.95	Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_112.wav	4.57	Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_113.wav	2.82	He was jailed for a year.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_114.wav	3.33	The whole thing is the music.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_115.wav	2.86	New Year will be very busy.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_116.wav	2.86	The result is a vacuum.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_117.wav	5.76	This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_118.wav	4.78	That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_119.wav	2.99	We have the mental strength.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_120.wav	5.04	Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_121.wav	3.33	That admission is not surprising.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_122.wav	3.93	In addition, investor choice is reduced.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_123.wav	3.97	We had another last Tuesday.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_124.wav	4.40	It is too pretty, it is too small.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_125.wav	3.89	The abuse of elderly people was appalling.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_126.wav	3.20	We did what we had to do.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_127.wav	3.67	But it is different in different regions.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_128.wav	3.03	They made such decisions in London.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_129.wav	3.12	Tiger is not the norm.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_130.wav	4.82	It is a variable condition and the diagnosis is difficult.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_131.wav	3.50	Ms McNeill was killed on impact.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_132.wav	3.55	I am totally devoted to this job.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_133.wav	3.03	Before it was an ordeal.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_134.wav	4.40	It could be done by experts and lawyers.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_135.wav	3.46	Reaction to the device was mixed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_136.wav	3.93	Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_137.wav	3.20	It was started almost by accident.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_138.wav	3.97	Scotland will finish the group in second place.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_139.wav	4.31	I think he's the favourite, no question.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_140.wav	3.93	I'm so grateful for that.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_141.wav	2.65	But she was very human.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_142.wav	2.39	What happened in that game ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_143.wav	2.31	Are you going to win ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_144.wav	1.96	Was it the wife ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_145.wav	2.01	Why change it ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_146.wav	3.63	What do we want to do that for ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_147.wav	2.18	Does the name matter ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_148.wav	2.31	how do you get it back ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_149.wav	3.93	Commercial producers were present in large numbers.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_150.wav	3.67	The referee faces a massive job.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_151.wav	3.37	His second goal was equally impressive.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_152.wav	2.90	He was seen as the enemy.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_153.wav	3.67	That group reported just before Christmas.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_154.wav	4.14	Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_155.wav	3.63	It opens the door to the Champions League.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_156.wav	3.46	So I got a blood test.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_157.wav	6.06	No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_158.wav	3.50	I haven't made any definite decisions.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_159.wav	3.89	The two companies were not for sale.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_160.wav	3.37	People were actually not on his side.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_161.wav	2.69	We have to speed up the process.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_162.wav	3.12	There's only one team in Ayrshire.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_163.wav	2.95	The weather forecast isn't good.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_164.wav	2.56	Nothing was meant by it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_165.wav	2.77	Behind him was his brother.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_166.wav	2.52	It was by the numbers.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_167.wav	2.74	The woman was his wife.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_168.wav	2.90	This action reflects a slump in bookings.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_169.wav	3.80	He was right into football from an early age.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_170.wav	3.67	The Internet is no substitute for customer service.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_171.wav	3.37	It's never great to finish second.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_172.wav	5.12	You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_173.wav	3.12	We have a budget in March.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_174.wav	3.42	Adventure is the champagne of life.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_175.wav	4.95	US is the only country to vote against resolution.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_176.wav	4.44	The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_177.wav	3.16	The people are the hero.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_178.wav	3.46	I always felt they played for me.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_179.wav	7.47	You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_180.wav	3.59	The second aspect was the fear of failure.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_181.wav	3.03	Phase one was a shambles.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_182.wav	3.42	If that's the case, he will struggle.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_183.wav	3.25	It is vital to clarify their role.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_184.wav	3.33	I'm just going to hit the shot.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_185.wav	3.97	Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_186.wav	3.25	Each case is treated on merit.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_187.wav	2.52	It is only the beginning.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_188.wav	2.73	He played it like a veteran.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_189.wav	2.57	Our destiny is in our own hands.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_190.wav	2.99	That's not fair to the supporters.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_191.wav	3.12	We've just had it confirmed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_192.wav	3.25	I will have to order its destruction.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_193.wav	2.31	You know the sort of thing.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_194.wav	3.03	I cannot say too much about them.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_195.wav	2.99	But there's an upturn in the sector.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_196.wav	3.03	It shows the strength of the roots.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_197.wav	3.12	I'm interested in interesting work.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_198.wav	3.20	Shelter also supports the reform.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_199.wav	3.54	We represent a wide range of society.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_200.wav	5.55	Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_201.wav	2.82	It caused a lot of upset.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_202.wav	4.06	It had little effect on European equity markets.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_203.wav	3.97	This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_204.wav	3.41	It's very difficult to find a buyer.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_205.wav	4.01	Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_206.wav	3.42	In due course we will make an announcement.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_207.wav	3.37	He should emerge as the winner.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_208.wav	2.35	He was then replaced by Ross.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_209.wav	2.31	And they were being paid ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_210.wav	2.95	was everything done to save people ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_211.wav	3.12	What was the matter for concern ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_212.wav	2.99	Do I think about them often ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_213.wav	2.60	Is it in the right place ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_214.wav	1.88	Did he trip ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_215.wav	3.80	For the meantime, though, the signs are good.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_216.wav	2.99	Here the picture is broadly stable.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_217.wav	2.86	This will be our new beginning.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_218.wav	4.23	Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_219.wav	4.18	The early physical reports were clear.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_220.wav	3.76	The result is utterly compelling.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_221.wav	4.78	Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_222.wav	4.61	This decision will prove to be the opposite of a standstill.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_223.wav	4.44	We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_224.wav	2.69	Little is known about them.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_225.wav	3.29	I won't make an official complaint.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_226.wav	2.77	It was worth a photograph.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_227.wav	3.89	The move follows a review of the Singapore)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_228.wav	3.29	We have an election in eight days.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_229.wav	4.65	Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_230.wav	4.53	January is a bad time of year.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_231.wav	3.37	HARRY Potter has lost his magic.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_232.wav	2.95	Today we must not repeat that mistake.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_233.wav	3.16	From there, they can go anywhere.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_234.wav	2.69	I am delighted for Simon.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_235.wav	2.60	It had all been arranged.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_236.wav	2.56	My daughter is an adult.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_237.wav	2.82	His third goal was superb.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_238.wav	3.33	It was finally agreed on Saturday.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_239.wav	3.38	They are difficult awards to decide.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_240.wav	2.56	I am considered a teenager.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_241.wav	3.08	Anyway, the job will be part-time.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_242.wav	2.74	He must get to know himself.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_243.wav	3.37	The transaction is not feasible.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_244.wav	3.46	People should make their own decisions.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_245.wav	3.67	The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_246.wav	3.16	Things were so intense in the studio.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_247.wav	2.99	We will reform the welfare state.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_248.wav	3.33	His background is firmly in venture capital.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_249.wav	3.71	It's easy to be negative about these things.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_250.wav	3.50	I didn't play too well in the third quarter.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_251.wav	2.82	The scientific debate is dead.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_252.wav	3.29	Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_253.wav	2.52	You are like an animal.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_254.wav	2.43	The body follows the mind.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_255.wav	2.61	We will try to find someone.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_256.wav	3.50	It had so much to do with output.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_257.wav	4.06	The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_258.wav	3.03	I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_259.wav	4.14	Half of young people had had contact with the police.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_260.wav	3.33	It will now be revived.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_261.wav	3.29	Italy is a beautiful place.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_262.wav	4.14	I have never heard a rule that you could be too young.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_263.wav	2.26	I was just a kid.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_264.wav	2.69	Does that put pressure on us ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_265.wav	1.54	Did it work ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_266.wav	2.82	Do you think we are a top nation ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_267.wav	3.16	Is our children learning ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_268.wav	2.44	How independent is that ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_269.wav	2.39	What form did that take ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_270.wav	2.77	He was good, but not that good.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_271.wav	2.56	He said the right things.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_272.wav	4.23	Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_273.wav	3.16	I have received no explanation.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_274.wav	3.55	He also launched a new strategy for the agency.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_275.wav	3.12	Kingfisher can afford to wait.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_276.wav	3.97	Defensive stocks attracted some interest.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_277.wav	2.35	You can feel at home in China.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_278.wav	4.69	I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_279.wav	3.50	Either way, the investor retains the premium.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_280.wav	3.33	No date has been fixed for his return.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_281.wav	3.07	We will listen to any suggestion.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_282.wav	4.06	Washington is consumed by the crisis.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_283.wav	3.03	I should think so, too.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_284.wav	2.82	It makes no difference to their friendship.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_285.wav	3.46	Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_286.wav	2.65	You have got the evidence.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_287.wav	2.57	We accept the new rules.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_288.wav	2.91	It is probably in the culture.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_289.wav	3.80	On the contrary they stand to gain.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_290.wav	5.34	Blair is very positive at European Councils.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_291.wav	3.16	He took over our lives.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_292.wav	3.80	I rejected the idea of a separate residence.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_293.wav	3.46	I'd never run for them.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_294.wav	3.55	It is a mark of respect from the inmates.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_295.wav	2.86	They must play for each other.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_296.wav	3.03	These figures are truly terrible.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_297.wav	2.61	I felt about this big.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_298.wav	3.33	It is also very valuable.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_299.wav	3.20	There's not much money in cycling.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_300.wav	2.99	The stage was set for a showdown.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_301.wav	3.67	This could put pressure on UK inflation.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_302.wav	5.00	He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_303.wav	3.54	We're trying to get rounded performers.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_304.wav	2.69	They can leave at any time.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_305.wav	2.99	We shall rely on human beings.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_306.wav	4.31	It has the potential to be another North Sea.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_307.wav	2.65	We have a high quality product.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_308.wav	2.86	Blair also had a penalty.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_309.wav	4.14	Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_310.wav	3.67	I understand the security issue.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_311.wav	2.99	Frankly, we should all have such problems.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_312.wav	3.80	It seemed a logical expansion.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_313.wav	6.36	We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_314.wav	4.95	It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_315.wav	2.99	It's hard to see it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_316.wav	3.67	The record companies have gone through the floor.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_317.wav	5.76	This would provide a significant and welcome boost for local employment.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_318.wav	4.52	It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_319.wav	3.84	Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_320.wav	4.66	Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_321.wav	3.76	The circumstances have changed since last year.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_322.wav	3.25	We will deliver at director level.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_323.wav	4.40	We feel very comfortable in this international environment.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_324.wav	3.54	I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_325.wav	4.14	We would hope to make progress on that next year.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_326.wav	3.84	Again the parallel with football can be drawn.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_327.wav	4.40	I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_328.wav	3.24	And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_329.wav	3.12	I was just so determined.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_330.wav	2.82	No Briton has ever won.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_331.wav	2.09	Are they free ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_332.wav	1.80	What are they for ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_333.wav	2.26	Is there a waiting list ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_334.wav	2.95	Do they think anyone else wants them ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_335.wav	2.27	So what happens next ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_336.wav	2.60	Had this been common practice ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_337.wav	2.90	What do they want us to do ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_338.wav	2.57	Is it worth it ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_339.wav	3.16	His appeal is instantly understood.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_340.wav	3.42	The results are sometimes contentious.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_341.wav	2.78	The songs are just so good.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_342.wav	3.03	This will save interest charges.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_343.wav	4.36	Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_344.wav	2.95	Sunday's game was not a trial.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_345.wav	4.48	Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_346.wav	3.16	McNaughton was not so sure.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_347.wav	2.77	Job losses were also announced.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_348.wav	5.12	A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_349.wav	3.33	The party lasted all night.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_350.wav	2.56	The pound has also suffered.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_351.wav	2.73	Scotland has shown the way.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_352.wav	3.07	There will be good prospects ahead.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_353.wav	2.73	We think the timing is good.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_354.wav	2.74	He will go a long way.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_355.wav	3.03	We want to play at the worlds.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_356.wav	2.90	Other people had looked at it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_357.wav	4.70	The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_358.wav	2.39	I didn't have the reply.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_359.wav	5.47	The output price index in December was unchanged on November.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_360.wav	3.07	You may have a short memory.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_361.wav	4.65	Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_362.wav	3.07	A Home Office spokesman said.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_363.wav	3.16	Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_364.wav	2.90	It's too horrible to think.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_365.wav	3.16	Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_366.wav	3.21	Industrial action has to hurt.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_367.wav	4.18	Nobody said it was required.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_368.wav	3.58	It was tough to contain the excitement.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_369.wav	3.63	They promised to fight the plans.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_370.wav	4.82	Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_371.wav	2.86	He was unable to come.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_372.wav	2.77	He was at school in Devon.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_373.wav	4.91	Many of these properties are located in the south of England.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_374.wav	3.42	Finally came the moment of truth.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_375.wav	3.12	Whether this return was too soon.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_376.wav	2.18	Neither man has been charged.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_377.wav	3.63	An alternative must be offered.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_378.wav	4.91	It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_379.wav	4.40	It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_380.wav	3.58	He can handle it without any problem.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_381.wav	4.69	But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_382.wav	2.48	He is an excellent manager.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_383.wav	2.65	I think we'll just keep it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_384.wav	3.71	The Allies intend to maintain the average.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_385.wav	3.12	I've always been a sensitive.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_386.wav	4.40	After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_387.wav	3.16	He had no previous convictions.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_388.wav	3.12	It was a massive error of judgment.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_389.wav	3.29	They should take their mobile phones.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_390.wav	4.65	Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_391.wav	3.12	They have broken that promise.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_392.wav	2.05	Does it matter ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_393.wav	2.26	How do you take them away ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_394.wav	3.80	However, there is an issue, isn't there ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_395.wav	2.82	After the match, do you ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_396.wav	2.82	That is a crazy situation.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_397.wav	2.99	We are really good friends.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_398.wav	2.99	The principle is quite clear.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_399.wav	3.07	The salary changes are long overdue.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_400.wav	4.57	The policy has led to a big increase in customer recruitment.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_401.wav	3.21	She said they would appeal.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_402.wav	3.37	They were to blame for the first two goals.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_403.wav	2.26	It would be quite nice.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_404.wav	2.65	This remains the party's policy.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_405.wav	4.65	In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_406.wav	4.10	The parties include the Scottish Executive.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_407.wav	2.30	We will win the argument.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_408.wav	3.63	Everything is now in place for Manchester.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_409.wav	3.33	Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_410.wav	2.77	The team hadn't been picked.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_411.wav	4.14	The prosecution say the girl was the only witness to the attack.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_412.wav	3.84	It sounds like a wish list.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_413.wav	3.29	The director will be present.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_414.wav	2.90	It is the nature of his party.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_415.wav	3.16	Theatre is not a museum.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_416.wav	3.38	We have very limited capacity.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_417.wav	3.33	It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_418.wav	3.59	My view has now completely changed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_419.wav	2.60	I had a fortunate war.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_420.wav	2.56	It's too close to call.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_421.wav	3.71	I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_422.wav	4.14	I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_423.wav	2.99	I've had a wonderful career.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_424.wav	3.03	The BBC was a disgrace.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_425.wav	2.44	It is hard to understand.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_426.wav	3.89	But the foundations have been laid.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_427.wav	3.24	There was an element of frustration.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_428.wav	5.33	In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_429.wav	3.03	The casualties were not named.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_430.wav	3.08	The next few months will tell.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_431.wav	4.35	It is not over by any means.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_432.wav	4.06	A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_433.wav	2.99	Three years ago he would have been.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_434.wav	3.80	They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_435.wav	2.69	I watch the other visitors.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_436.wav	3.63	George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_437.wav	4.87	Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_438.wav	5.42	This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_439.wav	3.24	There is a solution, she believes.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_440.wav	5.85	His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_441.wav	3.54	It was submitted without their knowledge.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_442.wav	4.31	The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_443.wav	3.97	My aim is a top six finish.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_444.wav	3.12	It means an enormous amount.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_445.wav	3.12	Such an attack is bizarre.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_446.wav	4.10	If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_447.wav	2.95	I never had a childhood.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_448.wav	2.82	No-one wanted to run it tonight.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_449.wav	2.91	None of the pieces was commissioned.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_450.wav	3.25	There is another important factor.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_451.wav	2.69	I never found my rhythm.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_452.wav	3.03	In fact, the reasons are simple.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_453.wav	3.46	Strangely enough I felt very sharp.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_454.wav	3.59	It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_455.wav	2.86	Nobody has told the story.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_456.wav	4.65	Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_457.wav	4.74	He confirmed the coaching structure was already under review.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_458.wav	5.12	Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_459.wav	4.14	The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_460.wav	2.26	It is pretty bad news.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_461.wav	2.73	It certainly appeared that way.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_462.wav	2.86	We put our bid in last night.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_463.wav	3.33	Quality was high in all sections.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_464.wav	3.37	It could cause a little bit of disruption.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_465.wav	3.42	But we have built a platform for next season.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_466.wav	3.33	I think the goalkeeper should have gone.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_467.wav	3.59	They offer a kind of narrative.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_468.wav	2.95	She came to the Highland Show.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_469.wav	2.90	It was like someone had died.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_470.wav	3.16	They were good years for him.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_471.wav	2.91	Let that be their memorial.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_472.wav	3.20	Then came the farewell to Europe.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_473.wav	2.99	I'm very passionate about my country.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_474.wav	3.72	Phil Mickelson did that last year.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_475.wav	2.78	There was no trouble at all.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_476.wav	2.91	He deserved a red card.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_477.wav	3.21	The price paid for it was not disclosed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_478.wav	4.44	You have to have a proven track record to get them.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_479.wav	3.03	Some problems were too complex.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_480.wav	4.10	Their one weakness was running between the wickets.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p259\p259_481.wav	3.84	The chief constable has retired.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_001.wav	2.01	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_002.wav	3.76	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_003.wav	6.74	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_004.wav	4.57	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_005.wav	5.68	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_006.wav	5.68	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_007.wav	4.74	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_008.wav	6.19	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_009.wav	4.95	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_010.wav	4.18	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_011.wav	7.00	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_012.wav	4.87	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_013.wav	4.10	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_014.wav	5.25	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_015.wav	5.29	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_016.wav	6.40	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_017.wav	3.25	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_018.wav	5.80	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_019.wav	7.00	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_020.wav	4.57	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_021.wav	9.17	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_022.wav	7.47	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_023.wav	10.46	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_024.wav	7.51	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_025.wav	4.74	Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_026.wav	2.60	We will be homeless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_027.wav	1.79	Is this accurate?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_028.wav	3.54	I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_029.wav	2.01	They have no history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_030.wav	3.12	Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_031.wav	2.05	I'd just like to play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_032.wav	2.01	There's a story, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_033.wav	2.14	This is the window.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_034.wav	4.87	Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_035.wav	4.23	We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_036.wav	3.29	Then, suddenly, they weren't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_037.wav	2.44	It's a fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_038.wav	4.99	Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_039.wav	3.55	However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_040.wav	4.27	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_041.wav	2.90	Dancing was her life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_042.wav	4.48	It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_043.wav	2.22	We will push.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_044.wav	4.61	The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_045.wav	2.78	Among them are many criminals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_046.wav	2.18	It is marvellous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_047.wav	4.06	Every aspect of our play was first class.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_048.wav	2.09	Our people are ready.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_049.wav	1.88	Here's a clue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_050.wav	3.54	Her body was found about four miles from the car.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_051.wav	2.69	I was inspired by two things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_052.wav	3.89	For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_053.wav	2.73	My fitness was very poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_054.wav	2.56	Sadly, it can't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_055.wav	3.46	He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_056.wav	2.90	I expect a rapid response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_057.wav	3.03	What was the main difference?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_058.wav	2.05	There's a danger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_059.wav	4.10	We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_060.wav	4.31	Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_061.wav	4.91	George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_062.wav	2.31	It's that kind of place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_063.wav	1.92	They are real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_064.wav	3.20	I've spent a lot of time on buses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_065.wav	5.76	Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_066.wav	3.33	And if he hadn't become a musician?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_067.wav	3.20	That was a gold medal for certain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_068.wav	1.93	We should have known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_069.wav	3.84	Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_070.wav	3.46	Robin Williams is very subdued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_071.wav	3.03	He was at home with his pals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_072.wav	1.88	It was magic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_073.wav	5.08	Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_074.wav	4.66	The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_075.wav	3.20	Is there a new way forward?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_076.wav	2.43	The party is up for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_077.wav	2.69	Even the one she loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_078.wav	3.16	People must remain vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_079.wav	2.65	Today she has been released.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_080.wav	2.26	Who will pay for this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_081.wav	3.76	He had taken everything from me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_082.wav	2.73	He seems to be pleased with the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_083.wav	3.03	By then, he was walking on water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_084.wav	2.73	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_085.wav	3.93	The city council is a major property owner in the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_086.wav	4.78	Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_087.wav	3.54	Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_088.wav	2.61	It is a lifeline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_089.wav	3.72	They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_090.wav	3.93	This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_091.wav	3.07	She is an expert on medical ethics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_092.wav	3.63	That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_093.wav	2.35	Then came the crunch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_094.wav	2.01	It is annoying.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_095.wav	1.92	I love the Dome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_096.wav	4.87	We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_097.wav	2.48	I am extremely sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_098.wav	2.43	It is a love affair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_099.wav	5.72	However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_100.wav	2.82	May not have been at fault?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_101.wav	2.22	They tried to deny it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_102.wav	3.76	They make a selective perception process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_103.wav	6.78	Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_104.wav	2.31	That's all right then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_105.wav	2.69	Oil embargo endorsed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_106.wav	3.50	Before the game we went for a pint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_107.wav	2.09	She reflects a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_108.wav	5.38	Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_109.wav	3.80	While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_110.wav	2.43	It was a funny game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_111.wav	4.14	According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_112.wav	3.03	I was fighting for my life, I thought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_113.wav	2.52	It was the eighties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_114.wav	4.57	I did not see any reason to change the captain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_115.wav	2.52	It is so sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_116.wav	4.31	We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_117.wav	4.02	It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_118.wav	5.04	Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_119.wav	2.90	It is rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_120.wav	4.61	That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_121.wav	2.48	We enjoyed it today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_122.wav	4.69	We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_123.wav	2.90	There were no grounds for his action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_124.wav	3.38	I can't even get into the A team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_125.wav	3.12	She really suffered for her art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_126.wav	4.01	It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_127.wav	2.60	The people will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_128.wav	3.42	No production was achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_129.wav	3.80	She said she would not welcome the flowers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_130.wav	2.86	It plans to return to this field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_131.wav	5.08	Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_132.wav	5.34	Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_133.wav	5.21	On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_134.wav	4.95	We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_135.wav	2.26	I don't know the full story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_136.wav	2.78	It seems so long since I did the exams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_137.wav	3.76	And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_138.wav	3.29	It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_139.wav	2.22	I was awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_140.wav	2.52	The idea is simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_141.wav	3.42	That group reported just before Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_142.wav	4.70	He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_143.wav	3.20	It is not just about pay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_144.wav	2.09	Note the date.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_145.wav	2.82	So I got a blood test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_146.wav	4.22	The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_147.wav	5.08	But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_148.wav	2.86	The weather forecast isn't good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_149.wav	3.54	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_150.wav	5.25	The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_151.wav	2.56	I was on a roll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_152.wav	2.39	She had gone to the Catholic school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_153.wav	3.16	We are on a four-year mission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_154.wav	2.39	My Dad is a hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_155.wav	2.56	He was asked to quit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_156.wav	4.10	The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_157.wav	2.48	He can do no wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_158.wav	2.91	Was this element always there?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_159.wav	2.78	These days are long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_160.wav	3.54	It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_161.wav	4.95	Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_162.wav	2.82	They are not advertised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_163.wav	3.88	Seven people were later detained by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_164.wav	4.87	It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_165.wav	2.65	Again, we were lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_166.wav	2.61	They will do their own thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_167.wav	2.65	Does that put pressure on us?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_168.wav	2.73	One season, they might do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_169.wav	2.56	Is Saddam a threat?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_170.wav	2.48	As we worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_171.wav	4.78	However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_172.wav	4.70	It is not either national standards or local control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_173.wav	3.97	I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_174.wav	2.73	I'm just going to hit the shot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_175.wav	2.69	Everyone can be bought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_176.wav	4.83	Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_177.wav	2.35	I've been there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_178.wav	2.73	Four policemen were wounded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_179.wav	3.55	I saw military vehicles in the distance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_180.wav	3.97	The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_181.wav	3.33	What has caused the demise of singing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_182.wav	3.93	He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_183.wav	3.21	Our team is just so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_184.wav	4.44	I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_185.wav	2.69	It is a farce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_186.wav	1.84	Peace was won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_187.wav	4.57	It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_188.wav	2.01	I came home by ambulance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_189.wav	4.18	The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_190.wav	2.27	Is that success?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_191.wav	1.84	They are ready.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_192.wav	1.58	I have a cold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_193.wav	3.33	The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_194.wav	3.76	I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_195.wav	3.12	It's all about money, money, money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_196.wav	3.16	There was no safety net.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_197.wav	2.43	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_198.wav	3.25	It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_199.wav	4.57	After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_200.wav	2.22	There was an e-mail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_201.wav	3.63	Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_202.wav	2.31	I am delighted for Simon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_203.wav	2.78	It had all been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_204.wav	4.82	It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_205.wav	4.18	So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_206.wav	2.05	It's not ideal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_207.wav	3.89	In each case they were a goal down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_208.wav	4.31	However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_209.wav	2.05	I might come back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_210.wav	4.91	The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_211.wav	4.74	The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_212.wav	5.12	Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_213.wav	5.04	This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_214.wav	3.93	At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_215.wav	4.74	The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_216.wav	4.23	Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_217.wav	3.12	It's a question of creating a future awareness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_218.wav	2.26	It's not before time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_219.wav	3.80	I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_220.wav	3.20	The report is due out next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_221.wav	2.69	But she was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_222.wav	5.42	Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_223.wav	3.07	My wife and family are the support system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_224.wav	4.01	The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_225.wav	1.97	We were awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_226.wav	3.37	They tried to give her advice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_227.wav	3.89	The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_228.wav	4.10	The parties have been given until today to respond.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_229.wav	2.14	There is no excuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_230.wav	4.57	On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_231.wav	3.16	But it's a subtle process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_232.wav	4.14	The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_233.wav	2.52	The car was just there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_234.wav	2.61	The whole thing will be great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_235.wav	2.78	Our policy is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_236.wav	3.72	I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_237.wav	2.77	You can feel at home in China.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_238.wav	2.69	The scene is about this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_239.wav	4.57	The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_240.wav	3.63	It was a kind of contempt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_241.wav	4.27	In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_242.wav	3.80	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_243.wav	2.43	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_244.wav	1.97	It was a hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_245.wav	2.22	There's the mix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_246.wav	4.06	There will be widespread support on all sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_247.wav	3.58	Is there on his hands?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_248.wav	3.93	He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_249.wav	3.80	That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_250.wav	5.12	However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_251.wav	2.35	Chelsea was a great club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_252.wav	3.84	It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_253.wav	1.79	We have to expand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_254.wav	3.59	It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_255.wav	2.65	Is that a serious question?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_256.wav	2.74	They must play for each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_257.wav	4.44	However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_258.wav	3.24	There's not much money in cycling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_259.wav	4.14	This court has made an order which has not been observed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_260.wav	2.61	I am just trying to do my job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_261.wav	2.82	This is a question of Islam.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_262.wav	4.10	Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_263.wav	3.89	I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_264.wav	4.14	Frankly, we should all have such problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_265.wav	2.39	The system can work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_266.wav	1.92	We're in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_267.wav	2.99	Our objective is to tackle poverty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_268.wav	2.18	It's a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_269.wav	3.29	She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_270.wav	4.74	However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_271.wav	2.27	They seem to get away with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_272.wav	2.43	She looked so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_273.wav	3.97	His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_274.wav	4.14	Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_275.wav	4.10	If not, he should go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_276.wav	3.50	We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_277.wav	2.30	We are a grandmother.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_278.wav	4.87	There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_279.wav	2.48	You feel very helpless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_280.wav	4.44	This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_281.wav	3.46	What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_282.wav	3.58	He will address the nation this evening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_283.wav	3.41	They have shown a great desire and attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_284.wav	3.50	Maloney is an engaging talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_285.wav	4.91	The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_286.wav	2.48	This is a national crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_287.wav	3.20	Bombing slaughter rejected
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_288.wav	2.69	We are not going to forget.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_289.wav	3.03	No Briton has ever won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_290.wav	3.03	Painful, but only because it's true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_291.wav	5.21	He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_292.wav	3.33	The songs are just so good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_293.wav	2.43	And it's a goodbye from him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_294.wav	2.60	The goals will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_295.wav	2.39	Who can predict?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_296.wav	3.93	If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_297.wav	4.65	I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_298.wav	3.93	Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_299.wav	2.01	I was the sheep.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_300.wav	1.92	What has altered?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_301.wav	2.22	Nothing is safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_302.wav	3.16	One was a lawyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_303.wav	4.19	The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_304.wav	5.89	A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_305.wav	1.58	They are wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_306.wav	1.79	I can live with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_307.wav	1.67	Work has started.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_308.wav	3.55	In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_309.wav	5.68	The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_310.wav	1.88	You should be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_311.wav	2.74	The minister is the engineer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_312.wav	2.39	The letters are going out today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_313.wav	2.95	We want to play at the worlds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_314.wav	4.06	The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_315.wav	4.44	and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_316.wav	2.35	Special measures were needed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_317.wav	3.16	The Premier League has been a huge success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_318.wav	2.18	The show is at an end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_319.wav	2.61	Your father was a good man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_320.wav	3.03	Such actions are rarely popular.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_321.wav	3.33	We have got to get the points from this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_322.wav	3.33	The election is total confusion and chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_323.wav	2.31	Henman has been warned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_324.wav	1.84	I would love it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_326.wav	3.33	The problems began a long time ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_327.wav	3.50	For the moment, our position remains the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_328.wav	3.59	Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_329.wav	2.61	We are in the end game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_330.wav	3.71	They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_331.wav	2.14	There was no time scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_332.wav	4.14	But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_333.wav	2.95	It is a job creation scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_334.wav	2.44	Relief was beyond belief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_335.wav	5.80	On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_336.wav	5.25	Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_337.wav	5.04	Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_338.wav	3.03	Finally, he paid for the movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_339.wav	3.21	You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_340.wav	4.23	In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_341.wav	2.22	He was the architect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_342.wav	3.29	Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_343.wav	1.80	He has to learn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_344.wav	2.56	Two people were interviewed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_345.wav	2.09	I've got no secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_346.wav	2.09	This is a big advantage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_347.wav	1.88	I'm very lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_348.wav	2.69	A great deal has been achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_349.wav	4.31	Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_350.wav	4.44	A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_351.wav	4.66	This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_352.wav	2.86	They should take their mobile phones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_353.wav	2.95	Eight months later, he was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_354.wav	2.27	I HAVE a dream.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_355.wav	2.65	We have big ideas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_356.wav	3.55	Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p260\p260_357.wav	2.44	I first met him last summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_001.wav	2.31	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_002.wav	3.97	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_003.wav	7.64	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_004.wav	4.44	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_005.wav	6.27	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_006.wav	5.51	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_007.wav	4.18	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_008.wav	7.47	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_009.wav	4.57	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_010.wav	2.86	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_011.wav	6.57	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_012.wav	5.81	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_013.wav	4.19	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_014.wav	4.65	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_015.wav	5.68	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_016.wav	7.09	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_017.wav	4.23	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_018.wav	5.42	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_019.wav	7.73	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_020.wav	4.10	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_021.wav	8.66	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_022.wav	6.23	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_023.wav	9.82	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_024.wav	6.06	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_025.wav	3.59	They are very clever in their use of words.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_026.wav	2.86	Meetings will also remain private.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_027.wav	2.05	Because we do not need it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_028.wav	2.56	Life was like a timetable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_029.wav	3.37	Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_030.wav	2.22	We will look into it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_031.wav	3.03	I have never been a member of the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_032.wav	2.18	It was a close call.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_033.wav	2.61	That means an extra two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_034.wav	2.65	This film will be totally awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_035.wav	2.48	That was the case with David.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_036.wav	3.07	He is believed to live in Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_037.wav	2.73	Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_038.wav	3.63	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_039.wav	3.12	Their campaign is in disarray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_040.wav	2.86	Among them are many criminals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_041.wav	2.73	I was released after six days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_042.wav	3.67	That's been the difference between the sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_043.wav	4.18	The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_044.wav	3.08	I would love to have him home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_045.wav	2.65	He will need that machine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_046.wav	3.55	It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_047.wav	3.97	It had little effect on European equity markets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_048.wav	3.25	Pulled a huge number of viewers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_049.wav	3.33	For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_050.wav	2.26	There was no safety net.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_051.wav	2.27	I must take a seat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_052.wav	2.05	It is on the news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_053.wav	2.82	The motive for the shooting was not known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_054.wav	4.40	Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_055.wav	4.31	The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_056.wav	2.48	We will pay their bills.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_057.wav	2.69	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_058.wav	2.26	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_059.wav	2.18	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_060.wav	2.05	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_061.wav	1.92	What do we do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_062.wav	2.99	I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_063.wav	2.95	Only water is currently allowed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_064.wav	3.50	He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_065.wav	2.95	It's not covered by the insurance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_066.wav	3.37	Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_067.wav	2.78	That's not the intention at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_068.wav	2.44	It starts with the script.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_069.wav	2.57	There could be a way back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_070.wav	3.71	They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_071.wav	2.52	Then followed a bout of flu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_072.wav	4.83	The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_073.wav	2.74	The price cuts are really exciting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_074.wav	2.73	He is now resident in England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_075.wav	2.95	These people are not big names.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_076.wav	3.54	After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_077.wav	2.01	He is in the queue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_078.wav	3.20	Both agreed on the success of the event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_079.wav	3.63	Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_080.wav	2.77	We have to offer value for money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_081.wav	2.13	Our mother is very worried.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_082.wav	3.59	Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_083.wav	2.57	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_084.wav	2.52	Potions said he would drive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_085.wav	2.56	They deserve a lot of credit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_086.wav	2.78	However, it did not end that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_087.wav	3.93	I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_088.wav	2.30	It is high time to act.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_089.wav	3.50	The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_090.wav	4.01	However, on this showing it's going to be a difficult task.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_091.wav	2.86	We could not get any possession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_092.wav	2.56	It was clear on Thursday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_093.wav	2.18	But it is up again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_094.wav	2.74	All the pressure will be on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_095.wav	2.39	You are like an animal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_096.wav	3.46	The move follows a review of the Singapore
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_097.wav	4.40	If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_098.wav	2.60	I had a ball today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_099.wav	2.82	No, the equipment is extra.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_100.wav	2.56	It is a good lifestyle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_101.wav	3.08	Before the game we went for a pint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_102.wav	3.12	We are also looking for new licences.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_103.wav	2.14	Our house was very small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_104.wav	2.09	It was a funny game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_105.wav	2.30	Why do it otherwise ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_106.wav	3.20	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_107.wav	2.26	So, did she meet him ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_108.wav	2.86	So what is the campaign about ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_109.wav	1.71	And does it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_110.wav	3.12	He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_111.wav	3.46	I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_112.wav	2.61	It became a national network.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_113.wav	2.69	He thought she was amazing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_114.wav	2.61	Maybe this battle has been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_115.wav	2.60	It isn't a happy memory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_116.wav	2.94	Actors like to be in the centre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_117.wav	2.27	It's not a quick fix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_118.wav	2.39	But it took a lot of bottle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_119.wav	3.33	Structural changes were also required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_120.wav	3.67	I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_121.wav	3.16	It is too pretty, it is too small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_122.wav	2.09	I was on a roll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_123.wav	3.54	The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_124.wav	2.35	My life has changed a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_125.wav	2.94	If not, a deal could take many months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_126.wav	2.65	That would open the gates of hell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_127.wav	2.86	He can perform well under pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_128.wav	2.35	I have accepted the challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_129.wav	2.14	You are a gambling man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_130.wav	2.74	He is a great addition to our team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_131.wav	2.86	This is a successful outcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_132.wav	2.56	I love the spectacle of cinema.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_133.wav	4.14	This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_134.wav	2.61	We will try to find someone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_135.wav	3.63	The others have all been in storage for some time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_136.wav	2.09	She died at her home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_137.wav	2.86	We could easily have lost that game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_138.wav	2.13	Check that he is dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_139.wav	3.38	Several messages can be taken from the occasion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_140.wav	3.76	Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_141.wav	3.67	Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_142.wav	3.54	Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_143.wav	2.95	The balance isn't there at EMI.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_144.wav	2.48	I would relish the prospect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_145.wav	2.39	It has become a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_146.wav	2.65	Like the others, he was arrested.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_147.wav	3.97	The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_148.wav	3.41	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_149.wav	4.06	The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_150.wav	2.31	It was by the numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_151.wav	2.78	But I am still awaiting an answer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_152.wav	2.44	We will turn the corner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_153.wav	2.56	He was asked to quit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_154.wav	3.33	This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_155.wav	3.03	The strong pound also took its toll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_156.wav	2.18	These days are long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_157.wav	2.18	The bank was now involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_158.wav	2.13	We have to move forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_159.wav	3.76	The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_160.wav	3.12	We knew we had the goal we wanted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_161.wav	2.90	The pension levels will remain the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_162.wav	2.82	I would probably have to agree with him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_163.wav	2.61	You had to go and see him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_164.wav	2.90	Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_165.wav	3.72	Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_166.wav	2.77	The region is open for business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_167.wav	1.97	They could not match it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_168.wav	2.05	What happened in that game ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_169.wav	1.88	Are you going to win ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_170.wav	1.71	Was it the wife ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_171.wav	1.88	Why change it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_172.wav	2.44	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_173.wav	2.82	This is no reflection on Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_174.wav	2.99	I always felt they played for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_175.wav	4.44	You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_176.wav	2.05	It is a body blow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_177.wav	1.84	The jury is still out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_178.wav	4.57	It is not either national standards or local control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_179.wav	2.77	City sentiment is in his favour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_180.wav	3.37	I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_181.wav	3.07	These men could be anywhere in the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_182.wav	1.62	I will be in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_183.wav	1.88	Says the Duke of York.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_184.wav	3.33	Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_185.wav	2.61	I had too much to drink.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_186.wav	2.65	They need to look after themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_187.wav	2.22	He prefers to play for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_188.wav	2.35	That is a waste of energy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_189.wav	3.12	It could be done by experts and lawyers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_190.wav	3.33	DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_191.wav	2.14	That was the theory, anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_192.wav	2.44	It was a pre-emptive strike.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_193.wav	3.16	It had been in place since last July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_194.wav	3.24	Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_195.wav	4.06	This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_196.wav	3.07	It's very difficult to find a buyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_197.wav	3.37	We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_198.wav	2.39	He should emerge as the winner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_199.wav	4.82	On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_200.wav	2.56	I made a terrible start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_201.wav	2.61	It was a moment of madness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_202.wav	3.08	We believe a third party was involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_203.wav	3.93	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_204.wav	2.27	It was his own decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_205.wav	1.97	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_206.wav	2.31	how do you get it back ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_207.wav	2.27	What are you not good at ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_208.wav	2.39	I think, therefore I am ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_209.wav	1.93	Who was she ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_210.wav	2.44	A deadline is still essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_211.wav	2.60	I chose to go by the rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_212.wav	2.39	I won't make an official complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_213.wav	2.69	It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_214.wav	2.82	They are looking at a flotation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_215.wav	3.63	We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_216.wav	2.65	We have an election in eight days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_217.wav	2.78	It was far from business as usual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_218.wav	2.82	All will be revealed in due course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_219.wav	2.60	They have known the hard times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_220.wav	3.03	It has been like that all year for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_221.wav	3.20	Construction is due to begin in February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_222.wav	3.25	Seven people were critically injured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_223.wav	2.35	My daughter is an adult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_224.wav	2.78	IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_225.wav	2.69	He must get to know himself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_226.wav	2.09	It was a day for records.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_227.wav	4.14	For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_228.wav	2.65	And the World Cup has not even begun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_229.wav	2.48	Life is too short to be bitter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_230.wav	2.35	A terrorist is a terrorist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_231.wav	2.90	It could be to do with the location.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_232.wav	2.18	If it doesn't, it doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_233.wav	3.12	The statement contained no surprises.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_234.wav	3.54	A small number of new jobs will also be created.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_235.wav	3.16	Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_236.wav	2.61	They have not been in touch with the club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_237.wav	2.22	I need a publishing deal!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_238.wav	2.52	They tried to give her advice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_239.wav	3.67	In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_240.wav	2.82	Of course, that is not the whole story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_241.wav	3.08	No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_242.wav	2.27	This is a family club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_243.wav	2.52	It is the loss of my name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_244.wav	2.61	I haven't made the donation yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_245.wav	2.56	Well, they were the unlucky ones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_246.wav	2.56	The irony was not lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_247.wav	3.33	We have come a long way in the last few sessions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_248.wav	3.63	It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_249.wav	2.01	I was just a kid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_250.wav	2.48	It is now the big brother.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_251.wav	2.13	They showed a lot of heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_252.wav	2.65	Nato was not a love affair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_253.wav	2.82	He is due in Israel tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_254.wav	2.39	It was a poor performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_255.wav	3.37	That is the consistent approach of the Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_256.wav	2.61	We want to play at the worlds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_257.wav	3.63	Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_258.wav	2.78	We will listen to any suggestion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_259.wav	4.01	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_260.wav	2.39	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_261.wav	3.12	No production contract is yet in sight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_262.wav	3.25	There will be widespread support on all sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_263.wav	2.57	It seems a shame to leave it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_264.wav	3.16	My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_265.wav	3.25	This idea has been around for four years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_266.wav	2.39	The concerns are the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_267.wav	2.05	I can't get a job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_268.wav	2.05	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_269.wav	2.95	was everything done to save people ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_270.wav	2.65	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_271.wav	2.82	Do I think about them often ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_272.wav	2.35	Is it in the right place ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_273.wav	1.75	Did he trip ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_274.wav	3.54	He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_275.wav	2.18	I was ready for this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_276.wav	3.75	They must show the commitment and the work to go with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_277.wav	3.41	Blair is very positive at European Councils.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_278.wav	3.25	They are interior designers and architects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_279.wav	3.50	That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_280.wav	3.80	The Scotch whisky industry is absent from the agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_281.wav	3.84	The offer will run for the next three weekends.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_282.wav	2.73	At first I thought I was gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_283.wav	2.65	I am just trying to do my job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_284.wav	3.89	The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_285.wav	2.69	We're trying to get rounded performers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_286.wav	2.43	They can leave at any time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_287.wav	3.08	It has the potential to be another North Sea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_288.wav	3.16	It would be a tragedy if it had to close.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_289.wav	3.16	He has not created a Festival resource.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_290.wav	3.63	Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_291.wav	2.65	He has run a hell of a race.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_292.wav	3.59	It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_293.wav	2.61	He was also married with two children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_294.wav	3.12	It was an easy decision to come here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_295.wav	3.42	On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_296.wav	3.84	It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_297.wav	4.06	He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_298.wav	2.86	A senior party insider said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_299.wav	4.52	The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_300.wav	3.20	She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_301.wav	2.52	This will help our confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_302.wav	2.90	The two companies were not for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_303.wav	2.86	Her appeal is to be heard this week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_304.wav	3.50	In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_305.wav	3.12	The cause of the accident remained unclear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_306.wav	3.33	The partnership was set up during the summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_307.wav	4.23	It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_308.wav	4.31	Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_309.wav	3.29	We will deliver at director level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_310.wav	2.56	Size is not the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_311.wav	2.69	He will address the nation this evening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_312.wav	2.99	They have shown a great desire and attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_313.wav	2.35	Tony Blair said as little.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_314.wav	2.77	His was a huge success story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_315.wav	3.63	We would hope to make progress on that next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_316.wav	2.35	That is the general feeling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_317.wav	2.60	Holland won by five wickets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_318.wav	2.56	He was obviously very genuine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_319.wav	2.69	The casting is as perfect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_320.wav	2.86	It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_321.wav	2.56	A Home Office spokesman said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_322.wav	3.63	Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_323.wav	3.33	If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_324.wav	4.23	This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_325.wav	2.69	Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_326.wav	2.05	It is a potential danger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_327.wav	2.91	Cast Away now on general release.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_328.wav	3.25	That could bring the peace process to a standstill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_329.wav	2.52	The City welcomed the numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_330.wav	2.48	You will never get a conviction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_331.wav	2.73	The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_332.wav	2.73	That meant the search was unlawful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_333.wav	4.35	They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_334.wav	2.61	There will be good prospects ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_335.wav	2.60	I would do away with the dress code.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_336.wav	4.23	However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_337.wav	3.33	There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_338.wav	2.65	Both sides have been hit by injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_339.wav	2.18	What form did that take ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_340.wav	1.41	Are they free ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_341.wav	1.63	What are they for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_342.wav	2.14	Is there a waiting list ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_343.wav	3.03	Do they think anyone else wants them ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_344.wav	2.13	So what happens next ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_345.wav	1.97	This ruling is a farce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_346.wav	3.25	Both men were on one-year contracts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_347.wav	4.01	However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_348.wav	3.76	The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_349.wav	3.16	The Premier League has been a huge success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_350.wav	3.97	Thousands of British tourists were trapped in their hotels.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_351.wav	2.73	The whole family was in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_352.wav	3.42	Public opinion was split on the proposal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_353.wav	3.16	The election is total confusion and chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_354.wav	4.31	It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_355.wav	3.08	To beat the European champion is quite nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_356.wav	2.74	I've got a sense of humour, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_357.wav	2.60	Her life is now back on track.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_358.wav	2.56	There was some merit in that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_359.wav	3.08	That is a trend which will be encouraged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_360.wav	2.22	It's too horrible to think.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_361.wav	2.35	They are now out in the cold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_362.wav	2.86	At first, the youngster was not keen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_363.wav	2.43	My view has now completely changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_364.wav	3.76	Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_365.wav	2.82	He was then replaced by Ross.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_366.wav	2.69	He is not very big, either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_367.wav	2.77	Finally came the moment of truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_368.wav	2.56	Neither man has been charged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_369.wav	3.38	Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_370.wav	3.03	The idea was first mooted a year ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_371.wav	1.84	He did a good job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_372.wav	2.82	Had this been common practice ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_373.wav	2.44	What do they want us to do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_374.wav	1.96	Is it worth it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_375.wav	1.67	Does it matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_376.wav	2.61	He took a draw on his cigarette.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_377.wav	2.30	I am a lucky man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_378.wav	2.56	But they have taken the lesson to heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_379.wav	3.12	The Allies intend to maintain the average.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_380.wav	3.67	We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_381.wav	2.31	You did not see it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_382.wav	2.56	Alex Ferguson is the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_383.wav	2.52	They should take their mobile phones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_384.wav	3.42	We regret that they were brought in the first place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_385.wav	3.59	From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_386.wav	4.10	On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_387.wav	3.93	However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_388.wav	2.14	He must have seen the movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_389.wav	2.39	We must put a marker down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_390.wav	2.95	The result is called a patent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_391.wav	2.99	It's as wide as a church in here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_392.wav	2.65	This remains the party's policy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_393.wav	2.69	The pair are very much in love.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_394.wav	2.22	I am a good player.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_395.wav	2.91	You have to rely on each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_396.wav	3.07	However, it was well worth the wait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_397.wav	4.57	No other job in world football can compare to this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_398.wav	2.39	I wanted to go out on a high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_399.wav	3.29	I felt the head was very like me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_400.wav	2.48	It was fit for royalty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_401.wav	4.10	The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_402.wav	2.65	We operate as a Scottish company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_403.wav	2.56	How do you take them away ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_404.wav	3.33	However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_405.wav	2.48	After the match, do you ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_406.wav	3.33	He has been in a nursing home for two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_407.wav	3.07	He put some colour into Scottish history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_408.wav	3.67	This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_409.wav	3.20	It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_410.wav	3.37	Motion described it as a unique event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_411.wav	2.61	I had a fortunate war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_412.wav	2.94	The breakdown was much later in her life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_413.wav	3.42	I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_414.wav	2.05	It is good for Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_415.wav	3.42	It does not even have a staff shortage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_416.wav	3.54	However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_417.wav	3.20	Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_418.wav	3.46	Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_419.wav	2.31	But a surprise is in store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_420.wav	2.57	Smoking is also very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_421.wav	4.35	The second goal was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_422.wav	2.69	We're delighted about the vote.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_423.wav	2.56	The case will now go to appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_424.wav	3.59	This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_425.wav	2.56	Yet the data is compelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_426.wav	2.95	It was important to win the singles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_427.wav	3.42	He's had to suffer for the last six years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_428.wav	3.80	The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_429.wav	2.05	He was on a horse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_430.wav	3.33	Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_431.wav	2.01	That's the way it works.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_432.wav	3.80	The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_433.wav	3.89	It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_434.wav	2.78	Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_435.wav	2.31	He is on the wrong side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_436.wav	4.06	By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_437.wav	2.39	It was the climax of the thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_438.wav	2.35	The trial will open today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_439.wav	3.84	I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_440.wav	2.61	It will make a huge difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_441.wav	2.82	It is an absolute nonsense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_442.wav	3.25	Everything in golf is a balance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_443.wav	2.95	It is a case of pity for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_444.wav	2.52	Gordon is also highly rated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_445.wav	2.69	The first game is so important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_446.wav	3.07	It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_447.wav	2.18	And we might go back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_448.wav	2.56	We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_449.wav	2.35	He deserves a second chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_450.wav	2.26	You have to see the work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_451.wav	2.43	The funding is now there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_452.wav	3.46	But we have built a platform for next season.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_453.wav	2.10	I was embarrassed by it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_454.wav	3.16	I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_455.wav	3.54	First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_456.wav	2.61	Paris is not only young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_457.wav	2.78	No one wants to go through these things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_458.wav	2.56	Our legal advice is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_459.wav	2.65	It all began as an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_460.wav	3.20	Long-term, it was the right thing to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_461.wav	3.67	It might be useful to have something in black and white.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_462.wav	2.18	They were totally behind it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_463.wav	2.52	Let that be their memorial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_464.wav	3.42	Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_465.wav	2.99	She would take the Farmer to the opera.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_466.wav	3.97	The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_467.wav	2.91	Phil Mickelson did that last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_468.wav	2.95	No options are excluded at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_469.wav	2.52	They are defined by law.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_470.wav	2.65	If that's the case, he will struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_471.wav	3.37	I'm very pleased for the club and for myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_472.wav	2.78	It's been a long, long journey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_473.wav	2.01	War is not the action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p261\p261_474.wav	2.52	My place is in the kitchen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_001.wav	2.35	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_002.wav	4.82	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_003.wav	8.24	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_004.wav	5.04	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_005.wav	6.91	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_006.wav	6.53	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_007.wav	4.78	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_008.wav	8.88	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_009.wav	5.93	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_010.wav	3.33	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_011.wav	7.30	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_012.wav	4.87	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_013.wav	5.29	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_014.wav	6.02	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_015.wav	7.04	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_016.wav	7.34	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_017.wav	3.88	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_018.wav	6.15	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_019.wav	8.28	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_020.wav	4.53	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_021.wav	9.60	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_022.wav	7.64	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_023.wav	11.53	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_024.wav	7.73	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_025.wav	4.57	The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_026.wav	5.30	They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_027.wav	3.50	However, the following year the cancer returned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_028.wav	4.10	Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_029.wav	4.78	We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_030.wav	5.51	They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_031.wav	2.74	I expected these kind of questions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_032.wav	2.69	This is the window.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_033.wav	3.03	People love to see this stuff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_034.wav	2.95	Life was like a timetable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_035.wav	2.78	Then, suddenly, they weren't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_036.wav	4.31	Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_037.wav	1.92	It was clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_038.wav	2.69	The problem is the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_039.wav	1.96	It was ugly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_040.wav	5.55	However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_041.wav	4.48	Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_042.wav	2.05	The judge said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_043.wav	2.82	It's a crucial award.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_044.wav	2.91	It is difficult for Ali.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_045.wav	4.66	The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_046.wav	2.14	I was angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_047.wav	3.42	It has been a horrible, horrible time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_048.wav	2.78	They had to explain it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_049.wav	2.44	He had no enemies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_050.wav	3.03	We were surprised to see the photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_051.wav	3.12	Next league matches Celtic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_052.wav	4.14	There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_053.wav	2.69	It's very odd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_054.wav	5.29	Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_055.wav	3.50	It's not pretty, but it's effective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_056.wav	4.65	This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_057.wav	8.45	New York is expected to come to a standstill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_058.wav	2.43	Jobs could go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_059.wav	3.03	And a film maker was born.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_060.wav	2.31	I fell against him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_061.wav	2.48	There was a battle there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_062.wav	4.95	There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_063.wav	3.29	And if he hadn't become a musician?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_064.wav	1.97	He was popular.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_065.wav	4.52	Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_066.wav	3.89	It is like a river running by my home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_067.wav	3.76	I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_068.wav	2.31	It's all I can do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_069.wav	3.12	He highlighted a lack of staff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_070.wav	2.90	Then followed a bout of flu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_071.wav	3.12	The girls are so lucky to be alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_072.wav	2.52	I had my suspicions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_073.wav	3.80	I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_074.wav	3.08	I've not thought about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_075.wav	2.60	What has changed?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_076.wav	3.20	I'd like to continue that record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_077.wav	3.08	Detection is often difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_078.wav	2.39	He is driven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_079.wav	3.37	All options are open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_080.wav	3.42	Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_081.wav	2.48	Someone who cares
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_082.wav	2.14	It's never too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_083.wav	3.93	Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_084.wav	3.38	That will come after the game on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_085.wav	4.35	Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_086.wav	2.86	Today I couldn't run on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_087.wav	5.46	Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_088.wav	4.69	This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_089.wav	4.65	That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_090.wav	2.52	Then came the crunch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_091.wav	3.59	The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_092.wav	2.78	They are now divorced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_093.wav	3.33	I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_094.wav	5.25	Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_095.wav	3.54	FOR once, you should believe the hype.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_096.wav	4.36	Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_097.wav	3.37	It is a good day for the coalition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_098.wav	5.04	However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_099.wav	2.77	Two of the team became ill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_100.wav	2.78	Oil embargo endorsed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_101.wav	2.65	It is a good lifestyle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_102.wav	2.18	It was an adventure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_103.wav	2.14	It's not perfect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_104.wav	4.18	While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_105.wav	2.39	He pleaded for caution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_106.wav	2.05	They are ready.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_107.wav	1.80	It's a shame.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_108.wav	5.12	Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_109.wav	3.76	Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_110.wav	2.73	They were behind the wheel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_111.wav	3.29	This film will be totally awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_112.wav	5.21	Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_113.wav	4.35	Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_114.wav	4.40	They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_115.wav	4.61	That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_116.wav	2.22	Who would have?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_117.wav	3.76	The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_118.wav	3.41	I felt very strongly that England should have it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_119.wav	4.06	Next season for every manager is a long time away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_120.wav	3.08	They keep the atmosphere in mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_121.wav	4.14	So the European elections are extremely important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_122.wav	2.82	It was the same at Twickenham.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_123.wav	3.55	It plans to return to this field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_124.wav	2.39	Our intentions are real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_125.wav	2.05	The goals were good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_126.wav	3.50	Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_127.wav	4.91	On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_128.wav	3.63	Nobody in the world can get away from him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_129.wav	2.78	It's a question of fashion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_130.wav	3.76	It seems so long since I did the exams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_131.wav	4.40	Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_132.wav	2.22	We need to chat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_133.wav	3.33	She died at her home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_134.wav	3.12	I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_135.wav	2.61	It would be a last resort.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_136.wav	3.72	That group reported just before Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_137.wav	5.34	Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_138.wav	3.29	It opens the door to the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_139.wav	4.06	It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_140.wav	1.92	It is huge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_141.wav	4.36	I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_142.wav	5.16	Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_143.wav	3.89	Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_144.wav	2.57	Mr Blair had done well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_145.wav	3.80	We also enjoyed a lot of support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_146.wav	3.42	We should be clear about the role of government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_147.wav	2.09	It is a freedom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_148.wav	4.14	It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_149.wav	2.61	I knew he was good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_150.wav	3.50	They were later discharged from hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_151.wav	4.01	This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_152.wav	2.86	Neither side can win this war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_153.wav	2.09	He can do no wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_154.wav	4.06	Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_155.wav	4.27	A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_156.wav	3.07	He's been the key to everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_157.wav	3.12	Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_158.wav	4.18	They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_159.wav	3.03	As, indeed, they would be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_160.wav	2.78	They are not advertised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_161.wav	3.76	We knew we had the goal we wanted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_162.wav	5.00	However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_163.wav	2.82	It's that sort of night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_164.wav	3.71	It is not too late to get on board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_165.wav	4.78	It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_166.wav	2.60	We have a budget in March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_167.wav	4.31	Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_168.wav	2.82	The post will be unpaid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_169.wav	4.10	Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_170.wav	4.87	It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_171.wav	2.56	We've made a couple of albums.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_172.wav	3.88	They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_173.wav	2.26	Is Saddam a threat?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_174.wav	3.59	I feel like my game has come a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_175.wav	3.59	We wanted it left for a wee while.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_176.wav	2.48	The clarity is vital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_177.wav	6.40	Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_178.wav	4.22	There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_179.wav	2.82	That has been the easy part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_180.wav	2.99	He will need that machine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_181.wav	2.48	Nothing is safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_182.wav	5.68	And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_183.wav	3.54	They need to look after themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_184.wav	3.93	Miller was every bit as happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_185.wav	2.69	I had a train to catch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_186.wav	2.69	That would be my view.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_187.wav	3.63	Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_188.wav	3.97	Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_189.wav	3.03	We must keep our feet on the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_190.wav	2.05	It wasn't to be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_191.wav	2.95	I came home by ambulance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_192.wav	4.99	The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_193.wav	2.82	Our strategy is straightforward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_194.wav	3.58	The group is separate from the Real IRA.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_195.wav	2.48	People acted too quickly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_196.wav	3.54	The service from the other players was super.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_197.wav	4.74	He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_198.wav	4.44	He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_199.wav	4.70	Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_200.wav	4.57	On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_201.wav	2.26	They are in the euro.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_202.wav	4.40	The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_203.wav	3.03	It's all about money, money, money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_204.wav	2.99	There was no rescue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_205.wav	4.01	We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_206.wav	3.07	But I am a worried man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_207.wav	2.56	There was an e-mail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_208.wav	2.09	It's a big deal for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_209.wav	2.90	We'll have to work hard today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_210.wav	4.99	The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_211.wav	2.99	I had decided to quit the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_212.wav	4.44	The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_213.wav	4.10	I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_214.wav	3.46	He seemed to lose his focus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_215.wav	2.35	Work has started.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_216.wav	3.24	His death was a tragic accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_217.wav	5.33	But the military campaign is a military campaign against Osama bin Laden.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_218.wav	3.12	IT S the real thing, for sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_219.wav	3.07	We have not given up hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_220.wav	3.93	The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_221.wav	5.16	Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_222.wav	2.78	Clearly, the stakes are high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_223.wav	3.76	It's a question of creating a future awareness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_224.wav	3.46	The track is currently covered in snow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_225.wav	5.64	Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_226.wav	2.95	At the time, he was a living legend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_227.wav	3.42	The Dow Jones is way up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_228.wav	4.23	However, no further action was taken by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_229.wav	2.69	It's that kind of place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_230.wav	3.89	But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_231.wav	4.14	Half of young people had had contact with the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_232.wav	2.31	It's very safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_233.wav	4.61	A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_234.wav	2.86	It is a terrible loss.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_235.wav	2.77	But it's a subtle process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_236.wav	4.95	The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_237.wav	3.16	Of further privacy, he had no need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_238.wav	2.86	He was good, but not that good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_239.wav	3.80	This gives a financial incentive to switch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_240.wav	4.48	Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_241.wav	2.86	In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_242.wav	4.44	A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_243.wav	3.67	Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_244.wav	3.20	They may yet have the last laugh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_245.wav	4.70	Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_246.wav	4.61	I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_247.wav	2.78	The scene is about this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_248.wav	4.91	The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_249.wav	4.06	It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_250.wav	1.92	I was shocked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_251.wav	2.69	A friendship that will endure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_252.wav	2.99	I didn't need to watch it on the video.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_253.wav	3.72	He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_254.wav	3.97	I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_255.wav	3.46	That could be in place by next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_256.wav	3.76	At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_257.wav	2.26	We run within the law.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_258.wav	4.40	That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_259.wav	2.69	This is a big club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_260.wav	3.37	The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_261.wav	4.23	It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_262.wav	2.56	I am very angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_263.wav	2.14	I saw one body.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_264.wav	2.91	At first I thought I was gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_265.wav	3.46	They wanted the club to make money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_266.wav	3.67	We shall rely on human beings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_267.wav	3.59	Immediate action must be taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_268.wav	2.52	It's very nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_269.wav	3.54	He was also married with two children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_270.wav	3.12	It was an easy decision to come here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_271.wav	4.27	Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_272.wav	2.52	It's not even finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_273.wav	2.18	Things can change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_274.wav	4.70	Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_275.wav	3.29	Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_276.wav	4.82	However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_277.wav	4.53	His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_278.wav	4.91	Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_279.wav	3.97	It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_280.wav	2.60	We have to break that cycle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_281.wav	5.04	Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_282.wav	4.61	There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_283.wav	2.35	I saw it at a ruck.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_284.wav	3.50	What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_285.wav	3.07	He will address the nation this evening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_286.wav	2.78	The attacker died in the crash.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_287.wav	2.31	It was a virus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_288.wav	1.79	The mood is good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_289.wav	2.99	This is a national crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_290.wav	3.37	The death toll included five children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_291.wav	2.52	Who did the recruiting?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_292.wav	2.99	Mr Campbell received a phone call.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_293.wav	2.82	It's a lovely, lovely film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_294.wav	2.35	Well, he can do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_295.wav	3.50	It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_296.wav	4.10	It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_297.wav	2.95	And huge, indeed, it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_298.wav	3.54	The results are sometimes contentious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_299.wav	3.12	It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_300.wav	4.10	If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_301.wav	4.61	I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_302.wav	4.19	The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_303.wav	4.14	Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_304.wav	2.18	What has altered?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_305.wav	3.59	Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_306.wav	2.14	One was a lawyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_307.wav	3.46	However, the groups denied the claims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_308.wav	2.61	They should be swept away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_309.wav	3.63	We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_310.wav	4.18	It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_311.wav	4.48	Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_312.wav	4.61	They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_313.wav	4.57	Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_314.wav	2.78	The letters are going out today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_315.wav	2.78	We want to play at the worlds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_316.wav	3.16	Is there on his hands?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_317.wav	3.42	Special measures were needed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_318.wav	2.73	It's about my time as a guitarist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_319.wav	3.24	I never thought it would take this long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_320.wav	3.24	In fact, they have the opposite effect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_321.wav	2.48	We are a peaceful people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_322.wav	2.01	It should be equal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_323.wav	5.30	It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_324.wav	3.29	The problems began a long time ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_325.wav	2.91	My body is clearly capable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_326.wav	2.82	He said she was mad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_327.wav	4.22	It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_328.wav	3.76	Davis is very supportive, as a director.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_329.wav	2.44	We are in the end game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_330.wav	4.48	In his absence, the council adopted the change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_331.wav	3.08	The parents will have a great time, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_332.wav	2.44	I am so upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_333.wav	4.36	It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_334.wav	3.25	It could have gone either way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_335.wav	2.86	He was then replaced by Ross.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_336.wav	3.03	Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_337.wav	3.67	It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_338.wav	3.76	The team for the first game could be this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_339.wav	4.06	I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_340.wav	4.70	The Scottish Prison Service said it could not comment on the visit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_341.wav	2.99	His views are hardly surprising.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_342.wav	2.18	I would miss him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_343.wav	2.95	It will be very, very tight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_344.wav	3.93	That is the very reason why it was so vital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_345.wav	3.07	It was forced to divert.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_346.wav	3.46	I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_347.wav	3.08	Chambers said he would accept the place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_348.wav	5.85	This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_349.wav	4.27	A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_350.wav	2.44	I got a yellow card.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_351.wav	2.26	There is no link.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_352.wav	4.35	The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_353.wav	4.23	On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_354.wav	4.91	The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_355.wav	4.18	A man has since been charged with his murder.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_356.wav	1.97	It is horrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_357.wav	3.71	The council said the house would have to be demolished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_358.wav	3.80	Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_359.wav	2.26	He's very explosive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_360.wav	3.07	It was one in the afternoon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_361.wav	2.22	We will be homeless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_362.wav	1.79	That would help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_363.wav	3.93	Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_364.wav	3.03	It was a double tragedy for the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_365.wav	3.97	We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_366.wav	4.10	We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_367.wav	3.67	For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_368.wav	3.71	I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_369.wav	2.39	Talks are progressing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_370.wav	3.29	The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_371.wav	3.12	It was a funny game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_372.wav	2.61	It is a large number.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_373.wav	3.76	We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_374.wav	3.50	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_375.wav	2.31	I am a wealthy person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_376.wav	2.05	Something is wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_377.wav	2.74	Mentally, you have to be tough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_378.wav	2.39	I am very happy with life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_379.wav	2.05	I was so nervous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_380.wav	3.24	We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_381.wav	2.90	However, it's good to turn the page.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_382.wav	3.42	It would be a massive boost for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_383.wav	2.99	The release attracted little attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_384.wav	2.69	It was important to win the singles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_385.wav	4.10	Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_386.wav	2.22	We're looking for justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_387.wav	4.87	The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_388.wav	2.09	They are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_389.wav	3.03	It was a breathtaking moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_390.wav	2.22	It was on fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_391.wav	4.78	This is a major step forward for carers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_392.wav	3.33	But, in fact, the reverse is true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_393.wav	2.78	Emotions were complex.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p262\p262_394.wav	3.89	His remarks appear to have had an effect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_001.wav	2.39	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_002.wav	3.89	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_003.wav	7.04	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_004.wav	5.34	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_005.wav	6.06	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_006.wav	5.42	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_007.wav	4.44	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_008.wav	7.13	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_009.wav	4.57	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_010.wav	3.25	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_011.wav	6.58	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_012.wav	4.95	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_013.wav	5.46	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_014.wav	4.52	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_015.wav	5.46	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_016.wav	6.23	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_017.wav	3.67	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_018.wav	7.00	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_019.wav	7.30	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_020.wav	4.01	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_021.wav	8.54	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_022.wav	6.11	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_023.wav	10.88	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_024.wav	6.61	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_025.wav	2.99	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_026.wav	2.52	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_027.wav	2.52	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_028.wav	2.18	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_029.wav	1.86	What do we do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_030.wav	3.84	We would like to find another region to develop in England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_031.wav	4.61	Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_032.wav	3.76	I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_033.wav	2.95	Allan Johnston was not match fit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_034.wav	2.18	The idea is not new.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_035.wav	1.75	I could not do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_036.wav	2.69	Life was like a timetable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_037.wav	4.18	Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_038.wav	2.90	You have to expect this type of thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_039.wav	3.25	No company would want to put their people at risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_040.wav	3.46	At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_041.wav	2.26	It could well be the case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_042.wav	4.57	This work on a marketing strategy would be finished within two months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_043.wav	3.11	She is believed to be in South Africa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_044.wav	2.05	It will come all right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_045.wav	2.86	It seemed the tough times were behind him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_046.wav	3.76	That company should not be allowed to operate in this country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_047.wav	4.44	The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_048.wav	2.86	Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_049.wav	3.54	I didn't think any player was a success on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_050.wav	4.14	People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_051.wav	2.69	I would love to have him home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_052.wav	2.31	He looks like an Afghan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_053.wav	2.30	He will need that machine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_054.wav	4.01	Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_055.wav	4.19	Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_056.wav	2.35	We have not given up hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_057.wav	3.20	It will now take over the running of the estate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_058.wav	2.73	I've got to provide for my family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_059.wav	2.26	It was bound to happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_060.wav	2.99	Four other charges were dropped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_061.wav	2.73	We have to keep our clients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_062.wav	2.78	Indeed, it is only the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_063.wav	2.90	Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_064.wav	2.35	I am pleased to be in them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_065.wav	3.59	He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_066.wav	3.42	But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_067.wav	3.20	There is an element of racism in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_068.wav	3.59	Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_069.wav	2.82	It is the only way forward for the club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_070.wav	2.95	I was very pleased with them today, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_071.wav	1.84	It's all I can do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_072.wav	2.86	The girls are so lucky to be alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_073.wav	2.48	It was nice to get a clean sheet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_074.wav	2.56	It is a job creation scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_075.wav	3.20	Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_076.wav	2.31	Even the one she loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_077.wav	2.82	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_078.wav	2.56	So, did she meet him ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_079.wav	2.73	So what is the campaign about ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_080.wav	1.54	And does it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_081.wav	2.43	Are you from the rugby ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_082.wav	4.44	Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_083.wav	3.29	Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_084.wav	3.80	The insurance company is only interested in your profits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_085.wav	3.38	However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_086.wav	3.33	Thomson is expected to manage the business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_087.wav	2.74	The damage from the fire was huge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_088.wav	2.52	A play is a set of actions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_089.wav	3.67	Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_090.wav	3.50	Scottish rugby has been in a state of civil war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_091.wav	3.25	I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_092.wav	3.71	The first few days will determine whether she can survive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_093.wav	2.31	The trick is to try it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_094.wav	3.97	The city council is a major property owner in the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_095.wav	2.26	It might change your life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_096.wav	3.20	No-one in the passenger train was hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_097.wav	2.61	Mr Blair should be warned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_098.wav	2.31	You might not make it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_099.wav	3.46	Officers recovered a second body in the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_100.wav	4.53	However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_101.wav	4.35	Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_102.wav	2.43	I did not have a bet on myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_103.wav	2.48	I saw the whole thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_104.wav	3.25	A progress report will be published in October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_105.wav	3.03	The investment will be in the food.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_106.wav	3.33	There is a contract in existence for Allan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_107.wav	3.12	Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_108.wav	2.65	Our preference is to play in midweek.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_109.wav	1.84	You are like an animal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_110.wav	2.86	In the end we made too many errors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_111.wav	2.95	It has been a nightmare of frustration.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_112.wav	2.82	That all hope is never lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_113.wav	2.43	It should be a great game, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_114.wav	3.29	Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_115.wav	3.97	It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_116.wav	3.12	He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_117.wav	2.43	He was jailed for a year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_118.wav	3.24	It was won on the issue of the land.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_119.wav	4.06	Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_120.wav	2.14	The fire was above the hole.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_121.wav	2.82	Pupils will be the losers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_122.wav	2.52	The problem was a social problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_123.wav	3.03	Such actions are rarely popular.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_124.wav	3.37	Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_125.wav	2.35	It isn't a happy memory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_126.wav	3.76	When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_127.wav	3.54	They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_128.wav	2.56	They've got to account for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_129.wav	4.27	It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_130.wav	4.48	It would be great to reward the Scottish public with a win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_131.wav	2.35	You can spend money on housing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_132.wav	2.82	I told him I was a long time ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_133.wav	2.65	They have to come clean.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_134.wav	4.39	It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_135.wav	3.59	I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_136.wav	3.71	His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_137.wav	2.99	It is just a tax on employment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_138.wav	3.20	The move has provoked a mixed response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_139.wav	2.39	The squad is too small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_140.wav	1.71	Why change it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_141.wav	2.52	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_142.wav	1.97	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_143.wav	2.05	how do you get it back ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_144.wav	3.54	The temperature in the town is very difficult to control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_145.wav	3.38	Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_146.wav	2.91	Any success would have been an improvement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_147.wav	3.20	Losing in that manner is very hard to take.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_148.wav	2.39	I never wanted a legal battle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_149.wav	4.06	And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_150.wav	2.48	Next time round, it will be different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_151.wav	2.05	She died at her home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_152.wav	2.48	We have seen a copy of the report.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_153.wav	3.59	But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_154.wav	3.42	It is the quality of the work that counts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_155.wav	2.18	Check that he is dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_156.wav	3.50	Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_157.wav	3.67	Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_158.wav	3.03	There is no mandate for a regime change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_159.wav	2.65	Like the others, he was arrested.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_160.wav	1.84	She will do for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_161.wav	2.09	I have had a good life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_162.wav	2.52	It was deployed in the Gulf War.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_163.wav	4.35	The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_164.wav	2.56	It is crucial for both teams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_165.wav	3.20	However, she did not report the matter to the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_166.wav	4.44	Nobody in Scotland has recognised the creative talent involved in this area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_167.wav	3.58	One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_168.wav	3.80	The other businesses were based in Yorkshire and Northern Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_169.wav	3.88	I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_170.wav	2.69	Neither side can win this war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_171.wav	2.73	Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_172.wav	2.90	These days are long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_173.wav	2.48	It is an attitude of mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_174.wav	4.01	They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_175.wav	2.48	Eight months later, he was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_176.wav	3.29	Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_177.wav	3.59	The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_178.wav	4.61	Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_179.wav	2.18	So was the first half.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_180.wav	3.67	You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_181.wav	3.42	The decision was blamed on weak investment markets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_182.wav	1.97	It's nice to be involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_183.wav	4.91	Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_184.wav	3.12	Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_185.wav	3.24	Waiting times for these services are too long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_186.wav	2.31	Time is now very short.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_187.wav	2.61	Our position remains the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_188.wav	4.70	It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_189.wav	2.65	The region is open for business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_190.wav	2.82	I feel like my game has come a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_191.wav	3.16	The championship is different from the other majors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_192.wav	3.37	It makes no influence on the public.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_193.wav	2.18	I thought he did very well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_194.wav	1.96	Says the Duke of York.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_195.wav	2.91	The shooting created panic in the street.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_196.wav	3.37	Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_197.wav	3.54	It could be done by experts and lawyers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_198.wav	1.88	You know the sort of thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_199.wav	3.63	My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_200.wav	3.84	We are committed to realising the potential of every child.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_201.wav	2.18	It is a terrible loss.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_202.wav	2.56	I think, therefore I am ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_203.wav	1.92	Who was she ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_204.wav	1.63	Or was it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_205.wav	2.35	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_206.wav	2.73	Two years later, she was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_207.wav	2.61	It is not easy to live in Russia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_208.wav	4.06	It is difficult to comment on the prospects for the year ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_209.wav	3.03	However, this idea is never developed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_210.wav	3.59	We believe the world has too many refugees already.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_211.wav	2.61	We must keep our feet on the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_212.wav	2.05	It is hard to tell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_213.wav	2.52	He should emerge as the winner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_214.wav	2.65	I came home by ambulance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_215.wav	4.44	This decision was taken with the full support of Scottish ministers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_216.wav	4.31	The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_217.wav	3.54	The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_218.wav	4.31	Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_219.wav	3.46	On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_220.wav	2.09	They are in the euro.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_221.wav	4.40	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_222.wav	3.16	The defender should have won the bloody ba.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_223.wav	2.52	A deadline is still essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_224.wav	3.46	We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_225.wav	2.35	Bombing is the easy option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_226.wav	3.16	He added that he was very sad about O Neill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_227.wav	2.65	Abbey National is an option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_228.wav	2.39	We can hardly talk about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_229.wav	2.69	It was located on the remote control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_230.wav	2.48	It is safe in our hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_231.wav	2.39	I'm just a regular person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_232.wav	2.77	I am considered a teenager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_233.wav	2.60	In each case they were a goal down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_234.wav	2.56	It's just a normal life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_235.wav	3.54	He remains a main board director of Royal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_236.wav	2.86	People should make their own decisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_237.wav	1.92	That you can do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_238.wav	2.73	We will reform the welfare state.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_239.wav	2.86	It could be to do with the location.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_241.wav	4.57	It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_242.wav	2.35	She will attend in July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_243.wav	2.57	The body follows the mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_244.wav	3.54	I always felt that I was in control of the match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_245.wav	4.91	We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_246.wav	3.03	That will be the criteria for the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_247.wav	2.78	I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_248.wav	2.01	We were a load of rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_249.wav	3.03	He has run a hell of a race.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_250.wav	2.77	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_251.wav	2.39	Do I think about them often ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_252.wav	2.09	Is it in the right place ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_253.wav	1.71	Did he trip ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_254.wav	2.31	Does that put pressure on us ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_255.wav	2.90	Frankly, it was worth the booking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_256.wav	3.37	The deal is expected to be completed by next summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_257.wav	2.43	The irony was not lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_258.wav	2.61	Three weeks later, he resigned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_259.wav	3.41	We have a free vote on these things in our party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_260.wav	2.91	It might be sad, but it's a fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_261.wav	2.30	You look like a rugby player.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_262.wav	4.66	Chairman Sir Alistair Grant will remain on the board as deputy chairman.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_263.wav	4.40	A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_264.wav	4.66	It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_265.wav	2.35	You can feel at home in China.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_266.wav	3.67	We've got a lot of that sort of nonsense in the North-east.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_267.wav	3.67	The whole point is to get the issue into the open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_268.wav	2.39	My son was too young to die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_269.wav	3.29	It should have taken a year for a company this size.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_270.wav	2.77	We were not allowed to go to help them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_271.wav	2.13	I didn't see the point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_272.wav	2.48	It seems a shame to leave it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_273.wav	4.48	The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_274.wav	2.01	I can't get a job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_275.wav	3.50	I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_276.wav	2.86	That could be in place by next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_277.wav	3.63	The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_278.wav	3.46	The distinction is also supported by doctors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_279.wav	3.50	They must show the commitment and the work to go with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_280.wav	2.22	They must play for each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_281.wav	4.44	The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_282.wav	3.93	It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_283.wav	2.56	They can leave at any time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_284.wav	2.77	I was delighted with the way he jumped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_285.wav	2.73	Much of the equipment was new.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_286.wav	2.26	You get a lot for your money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_287.wav	3.21	An announcement will follow in due course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_288.wav	2.99	He has not created a Festival resource.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_289.wav	3.29	He was also married with two children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_291.wav	2.35	I was first in the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_292.wav	2.52	Access has been a nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_293.wav	3.72	Further expansion has been achieved in Germany and Italy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_294.wav	3.42	It will always be the highlight of my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_295.wav	3.25	Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_296.wav	4.14	The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_297.wav	2.39	She failed in her action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_298.wav	3.37	Its body language is all wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_299.wav	3.97	However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_300.wav	3.12	The record companies have gone through the floor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_301.wav	3.88	So the Government will be damaged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_302.wav	2.52	I have lost all confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_303.wav	2.82	John was there already in spirit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_304.wav	2.73	In the end, it was no choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_305.wav	2.22	Are they free ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_306.wav	2.13	What are they for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_307.wav	2.13	Is there a waiting list ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_308.wav	2.86	Do they think anyone else wants them ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_309.wav	3.20	I intended to look for another club on loan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_310.wav	3.46	However, a ruling will not come before next week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_311.wav	2.90	Motherwell have no such good fortune.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_312.wav	3.97	The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_313.wav	3.03	I have decided to stand down from the list.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_314.wav	2.82	Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_315.wav	3.16	They had to learn to work from the consumer back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_316.wav	3.71	But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_317.wav	2.65	It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_318.wav	2.30	Nothing has been put into action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_319.wav	2.95	Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_320.wav	2.69	Like many companies, it is a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_321.wav	2.99	Action must be taken to slow down the traffic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_322.wav	2.56	However, a bid was never made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_323.wav	2.48	We're not an employment agency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_324.wav	2.95	I could not have hoped to run at this level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_325.wav	3.93	Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_326.wav	3.59	The following year was a miserable time for Mr Dewar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_327.wav	2.95	At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_328.wav	2.22	They come to enjoy themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_329.wav	1.88	There's still a bit to go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_330.wav	2.31	We have a good healthy debate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_331.wav	4.48	Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_332.wav	2.30	It is a court case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_333.wav	2.43	The minister is the engineer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_334.wav	2.18	There is no plan B.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_335.wav	2.01	He will go a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_336.wav	3.59	The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_337.wav	3.93	He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_338.wav	2.99	The Premier League has been a huge success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_339.wav	3.41	There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_340.wav	2.74	She is on a life support machine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_341.wav	2.35	He is married with three children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_342.wav	4.19	Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_343.wav	2.31	It's difficult to predict the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_344.wav	2.44	My body is clearly capable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_345.wav	3.93	Tourists are only concerned with the quality of their experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_346.wav	2.99	In the old days, it was easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_347.wav	2.56	The airport was even different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_348.wav	2.69	Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_349.wav	2.18	It is the same old story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_350.wav	4.40	Analysts were not surprised at the talks between the companies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_351.wav	2.73	Overall, we are very pleased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_352.wav	3.12	It was tough to contain the excitement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_353.wav	1.49	Does it matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_354.wav	2.22	How do you take them away ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_355.wav	2.82	However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_356.wav	2.43	After the match, do you ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_357.wav	3.29	The pain was almost too much to bear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_358.wav	2.52	Whether this return was too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_359.wav	2.86	There is a good example in this city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_360.wav	4.87	On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_361.wav	2.61	He was then replaced by Ross.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_362.wav	2.14	That's as it should be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_363.wav	3.54	The key player in this matter is now the Prime Minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_364.wav	3.03	It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_365.wav	2.52	There is a range of employers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_366.wav	2.48	But we welcome this document.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_367.wav	1.75	He did a good job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_368.wav	4.57	They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_369.wav	4.70	The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_370.wav	2.65	The value of the merger is still there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_371.wav	2.18	Nobody else was with me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_372.wav	3.07	She would take the Farmer to the opera.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_373.wav	2.82	They may yet have the last laugh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_374.wav	3.42	However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_375.wav	3.37	And I repeat, it would be for exposure and money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_376.wav	2.86	Like his acting, it was an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_377.wav	3.93	Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_378.wav	3.84	The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_379.wav	4.10	A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_380.wav	3.33	This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_381.wav	5.30	A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_382.wav	3.03	They were to blame for the first two goals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_383.wav	2.22	The bank was now involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_384.wav	2.47	It was like a weekly wage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_385.wav	2.90	Scottish teams have got to take their chances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_386.wav	3.63	We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_387.wav	3.67	But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_388.wav	2.73	You have to rely on each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_389.wav	2.69	This season has been a nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_390.wav	3.12	I felt the head was very like me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_391.wav	4.19	Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_392.wav	2.61	We have to put pressure on Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_393.wav	1.88	She has a little boy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_394.wav	2.48	Theatre is not a museum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_395.wav	2.73	I was just happy to get my own goal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_396.wav	3.63	He later became a respected High Court judge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_397.wav	3.16	The thing is to recognise that chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_398.wav	3.59	He has been in a nursing home for two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_399.wav	3.63	Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_400.wav	2.99	They have put in a lot of time and effort.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_401.wav	3.54	He's in his element and the audience is delighted by him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_402.wav	2.86	He replied that it was a dilemma.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_403.wav	3.25	We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_404.wav	3.59	He said the Parliament should be left to make its own decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_405.wav	4.65	MAN is fully listed on the London Stock Exchange.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_406.wav	3.37	We must improve our relations with government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_407.wav	2.95	The Cabinet is split over the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_408.wav	2.48	It was an amazing afternoon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_409.wav	2.90	The casualties were not named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_410.wav	2.74	We shall not be moved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_411.wav	3.37	I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_412.wav	2.01	It looked like a river.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_413.wav	3.41	The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_414.wav	3.03	Once again, they were back amongst the big boys.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_415.wav	2.73	It was important to win the singles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_416.wav	2.39	I'm pleased about one thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_417.wav	4.23	His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_418.wav	2.22	I had a tie in my hand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_419.wav	2.18	I can lead by example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_420.wav	2.32	Such an attack is bizarre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_421.wav	2.26	Today, the story is different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_422.wav	2.22	The Queen Mother is dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_423.wav	2.90	Head injuries are the leading cause of death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_424.wav	3.80	We have received a number of inquiries from interested parties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_425.wav	3.84	The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_426.wav	3.97	A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_427.wav	3.03	But we are severely limited in funds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_428.wav	2.61	Together, we can make a difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_429.wav	2.05	It is that sort of film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_430.wav	3.67	Mr Reid said the repeal was a sensitive issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_431.wav	3.24	They recorded their debut album in New York.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_432.wav	3.88	A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_433.wav	2.30	Which may be the same thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_434.wav	2.48	It is not a standing army.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_435.wav	2.95	We know about the crisis in cattle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_436.wav	2.91	As it turned out it was a triumph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_437.wav	2.44	We shall not forget him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_438.wav	3.33	I can't wait for the season to end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_439.wav	3.50	It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_440.wav	3.97	I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_441.wav	2.77	You have got to be careful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_442.wav	3.20	There is The Beautiful Game to write.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_443.wav	3.16	No decisions have been made in this respect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_444.wav	2.26	It wouldn't matter if he had.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_445.wav	2.39	No, because it was too many.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_446.wav	2.56	He deserves a second chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_447.wav	3.59	I believed that effort was needed in our own area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_448.wav	2.82	It is not over by any means.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_449.wav	3.84	The second goal was a terrible mistake by our defence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_450.wav	3.20	He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_451.wav	3.12	It is a tough game but we have a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_452.wav	3.20	But we have built a platform for next season.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_453.wav	2.26	It looked like a war zone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_454.wav	3.33	Legal opinion is that I may have a case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_455.wav	2.99	However, one has arrived in the post.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_456.wav	2.95	They offer a kind of narrative.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_457.wav	4.35	He looked on the deal as a merger rather than a takeover.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_458.wav	2.78	He doesn't like the Labour Party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_459.wav	2.18	It goes with the job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_460.wav	2.82	It has been a waste of time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_461.wav	2.82	The rest of the business is very robust.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_462.wav	2.18	I saw it didn't work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_463.wav	2.99	To tell the truth, it wasn't a good game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_464.wav	1.88	We are over the moon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_465.wav	3.29	It was another reminder of the power of an image.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_466.wav	2.22	They're just a good retailer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_467.wav	2.27	Tickets will be at a premium.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_468.wav	2.43	It's been a long, long journey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_469.wav	2.52	I just got under the ball a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_470.wav	3.80	There is a similar story for milk and dairy products.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_471.wav	2.31	That should get their attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_472.wav	2.56	It's just a place to open it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p263\p263_473.wav	2.61	My place is in the kitchen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_001.wav	2.73	Please call Stella.  )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_002.wav	3.97	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_003.wav	8.62	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_004.wav	5.29	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_005.wav	7.81	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_006.wav	6.28	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_007.wav	5.46	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_008.wav	8.20	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_009.wav	6.66	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_010.wav	3.84	People look, but no one ever finds it. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_011.wav	7.13	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_012.wav	5.34	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_013.wav	5.76	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_014.wav	5.67	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_015.wav	6.66	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_016.wav	6.45	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_018.wav	6.23	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_019.wav	8.02	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_020.wav	5.81	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_021.wav	9.26	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_023.wav	13.14	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_024.wav	9.18	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_025.wav	5.81	The west coast line is not just for middle England.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_026.wav	5.21	I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_027.wav	3.93	He does not even trust his own members.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_028.wav	3.63	We're only taking on a couple just now.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_029.wav	3.97	The local primary is excellent.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_030.wav	3.84	Do not give your details to anyone.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_031.wav	4.27	I feel I did not have enough time.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_032.wav	3.25	He added that her comments were noted.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_033.wav	2.52	It felt right for me.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_034.wav	3.03	We are opening an inquiry.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_035.wav	2.78	This remains the case.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_036.wav	2.86	Certainly, we do as well.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_037.wav	2.82	It carried a double message.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_038.wav	2.60	It was a total surprise.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_039.wav	2.86	I wish I could see it again.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_040.wav	3.71	I am secure in my owns position.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_041.wav	4.91	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_042.wav	2.52	It is a complex deal.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_043.wav	3.33	I made my mind up before we came on tour.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_044.wav	2.69	It does not stop here.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_045.wav	3.80	We're working on it night and day.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_046.wav	4.48	The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_047.wav	4.95	The results, out tomorrow, will focus on the company's strategy.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_048.wav	4.10	There remains some Scottish influence, however.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_049.wav	2.82	I only signed this morning.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_050.wav	3.67	The Office is a show about nothing, then.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_051.wav	3.08	We were leading by two goals.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_053.wav	3.72	It was dangerous but vital employment.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_054.wav	2.65	All options are available.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_055.wav	2.99	How are you, sir?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_056.wav	3.37	So is that it, then?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_057.wav	2.99	Do I have a favourite?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_058.wav	2.82	What do we do?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_059.wav	3.33	Why do it otherwise?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_060.wav	3.67	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_061.wav	3.12	So, did she meet him?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_062.wav	3.12	It happens from time to time.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_063.wav	2.65	You could very well be.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_064.wav	2.74	People come to see the Highlands.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_065.wav	3.46	It is nice to be a woman and a wife.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_066.wav	3.24	She always put the party first.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_067.wav	3.37	Things have just worked out this way.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_068.wav	3.24	That is not possible.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_069.wav	2.48	This is far too high.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_070.wav	2.35	He has real potential.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_071.wav	3.25	But I had never been in a theatre.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_072.wav	3.76	Without doubt, the debate on education is welcome.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_073.wav	3.42	Confidence is as low as it can get.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_074.wav	3.46	I think with my experience I can help the team.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_075.wav	2.82	That is really all.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_076.wav	2.73	The deal was done on Wednesday.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_077.wav	3.03	The time has arrived for a review.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_078.wav	2.78	That is very important.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_079.wav	3.03	Only water is currently allowed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_080.wav	3.93	Put simply, it goes something like this.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_081.wav	5.12	Over one million people have been forced from their homes.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_082.wav	2.57	It looks that way.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_083.wav	2.48	Now comes the hard part.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_084.wav	2.57	Maybe they will see sense.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_085.wav	2.95	We're at home, which is important.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_086.wav	3.67	Because I was a very physical person.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_087.wav	3.97	The circumstances have changed since last year.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_088.wav	3.80	They're already booked for next year.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_089.wav	2.86	The savings can be dramatic.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_090.wav	4.01	They would now be able to look forward with confidence.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_091.wav	3.88	They are a different team at home.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_092.wav	3.16	However this weekend it will be different.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_093.wav	2.48	Are you going to win?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_094.wav	2.90	What is the wife?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_096.wav	3.59	What do we want to do that for?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_097.wav	2.69	Does the name matter?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_098.wav	2.73	how do you get it back?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_099.wav	2.61	What are you not good at?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_100.wav	4.87	His massive advantage was never under threat yesterday.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_101.wav	3.29	Two of our crew were killed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_102.wav	2.82	I feel confident about the outcome.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_103.wav	3.46	The referee had been right.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_104.wav	3.88	Jack was always going to win this one.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_105.wav	3.20	It would be easy to think so.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_106.wav	2.90	You're quite wrong, he said.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_107.wav	2.65	I was born for this moment.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_108.wav	3.97	I first met him last summer.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_109.wav	4.86	The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_110.wav	3.72	You can maintain regular contact.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_112.wav	2.91	This makes up for it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_113.wav	3.33	Firm action must be taken.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_114.wav	3.08	But they had to be paid for.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_115.wav	3.50	That's the bit that's wrong.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_116.wav	3.29	Nothing would now surprise me.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_117.wav	5.93	Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_118.wav	3.88	But I am in practice.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_119.wav	3.20	Trading is tough at the moment.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_120.wav	2.99	It came a bit late.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_121.wav	3.16	All music goes into me.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_122.wav	3.59	That was a great performance by the team.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_123.wav	3.67	It seemed like four hours.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_124.wav	3.72	The family moved around a lot.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_125.wav	2.73	We beat the Welsh team.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_126.wav	4.10	An announcement is expected within a few months.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_127.wav	3.80	We have a team to reach the final.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_128.wav	3.03	Eight others have followed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_129.wav	3.76	These people were my friends.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_130.wav	3.67	That will bring about a dramatic improvement.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_131.wav	3.88	It's nice to see a very positive style of football.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_132.wav	3.59	This commitment should be built upon.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_133.wav	3.63	I hope we've reached the bottom now.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_134.wav	4.27	This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_135.wav	4.40	Domestic orders have also fallen since January.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_136.wav	7.05	However, it's possible that Dick can have influence some Dutch players to go there.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_137.wav	5.16	This is a separate announcement which is in a different league.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_138.wav	3.50	It's very dangerous for markets.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_139.wav	4.35	He said some things which were better left alone.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_140.wav	3.46	He nearly killed my son.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_141.wav	3.25	That comes at a cost.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_142.wav	4.65	Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_143.wav	3.59	I told them during their morning break.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_144.wav	3.80	The eye was badly closed on Sunday.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_145.wav	2.73	The truth will come out.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_146.wav	3.16	Mr Dewar understood that.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_147.wav	3.03	She's been shot.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_148.wav	2.73	Do I think about them often?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_149.wav	3.03	Is it in the right place?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_150.wav	2.48	Did he trip?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_151.wav	2.99	Does that put pressure on us?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_152.wav	2.14	Did it work?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_153.wav	3.50	Their moment had come, or so they said.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_154.wav	4.23	He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_155.wav	2.77	The second failed completely.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_156.wav	2.73	It gives a commitment.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_157.wav	2.78	Now it was Britain's turn.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_158.wav	3.29	We have come a long way since then.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_159.wav	3.72	Sport is good for you.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_160.wav	3.54	It was clearly not a battle.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_161.wav	3.63	No such meeting took place.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_162.wav	2.90	It is just too tough.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_163.wav	3.84	There is no doubt there's room for us.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_164.wav	2.86	The options seem limited.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_165.wav	3.16	It's been my life.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_166.wav	5.33	Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_167.wav	5.85	We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_168.wav	4.91	Everything people said about it was true.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_169.wav	4.31	I've no idea how it works.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_170.wav	2.95	No, but my wife is.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_171.wav	4.02	It is a large number.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_172.wav	4.82	I'm taking each day as it comes.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_173.wav	3.89	Art can challenge our value system.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_174.wav	3.29	Now he's back on top again.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_176.wav	6.27	No-one wants to talk about death.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_177.wav	5.29	Once again, he refused.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_178.wav	5.93	We just want this session to end.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_179.wav	5.04	You can spend money on housing.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_180.wav	5.85	I've never had a year like this.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_181.wav	4.10	Neil has worked hard throughout his career.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_182.wav	4.53	He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_183.wav	4.52	We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_184.wav	4.27	She really suffered for her art.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_185.wav	7.21	The single currency could well lead to a single tax policy.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_186.wav	3.25	She runs like her mother.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_187.wav	2.99	I remember that day well.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_188.wav	6.23	In short, the national team without Frank is like football without feet.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_189.wav	6.36	They were certainly tough, but totally fair.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_190.wav	4.86	The questions came quick and fast.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_191.wav	5.25	We tried four banks.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_192.wav	5.12	Is there a waiting list?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_193.wav	5.04	Do they think anyone else wants them?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_194.wav	3.33	So what happens next?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_195.wav	3.25	Had this been common practice?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_196.wav	3.12	What do they want us to do?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_197.wav	2.31	Is it worth it?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_198.wav	2.01	Does it matter?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_199.wav	2.52	How do you take them away?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_200.wav	3.93	At half-time he was presented to both teams.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_201.wav	4.57	Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_202.wav	4.31	I was independent but I am not now.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_203.wav	4.83	That first victory made a huge difference to my career.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_204.wav	4.83	People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_205.wav	3.16	I saw people on fire.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_206.wav	4.70	This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_207.wav	4.95	Both leaders were joined by senior party figures.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_208.wav	3.88	Her experience is certainly limited.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_209.wav	4.14	The labour side has developed in the North area.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_210.wav	3.42	He suffered severe head injuries.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_211.wav	2.99	He was a home referee.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_212.wav	3.63	Brian was last to join.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_213.wav	2.73	It was men against boys.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_214.wav	2.95	Three hit the target.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_215.wav	4.48	That could mean the difference between life and death in action.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_216.wav	2.82	Henry should go now.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_217.wav	3.42	Now we have fresh hope.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_218.wav	3.67	Life is still very tough for them.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_219.wav	2.48	It was a piece of art.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_221.wav	3.08	Britain will be little affected.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_222.wav	2.99	The two companies were not for sale.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_223.wav	3.63	IT has been a tough year for Scottish business.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_224.wav	2.86	It was all great training.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_226.wav	3.71	No partners would lose their jobs.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_227.wav	3.63	I was in daily contact.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_228.wav	2.91	He talks too much.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_230.wav	3.84	Many changes are positive changes.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_231.wav	3.46	This is absolutely not true.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_232.wav	4.95	Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_233.wav	5.25	It was a great evening.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_234.wav	5.12	However, there is an issue, isn't there?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_235.wav	3.67	After the match, do you?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_236.wav	4.31	Has the conflict started?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_237.wav	4.61	Have I really come to this?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_238.wav	4.65	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_240.wav	2.56	This is a big game for both of us.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_241.wav	4.65	He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_242.wav	5.25	They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_243.wav	3.59	Eight months later, he was dead.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_244.wav	4.82	The question is whether private investors should follow their example.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_245.wav	3.07	I go home only once.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_246.wav	4.10	It is based on population rather than need.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_247.wav	5.47	Progress, however, is only achieved through hard work and heavy investment.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_248.wav	3.67	They were game, but not very good.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_249.wav	3.29	I did not vote either way.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_250.wav	2.82	We really are a team.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_251.wav	1.92	I hit you there.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_252.wav	3.12	The pension levels will remain the same.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_253.wav	3.07	He is keen to stay in public service.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_254.wav	3.25	For that reason cover should not be given.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_255.wav	3.03	He felt too close to head office.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_256.wav	3.16	We have brought the staff back on board.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_257.wav	3.80	We had a right to expect those days were over.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_258.wav	3.46	The group's increasing scale will help.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_259.wav	2.90	We were looking for a base.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_260.wav	2.73	We had a grand view.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_261.wav	3.84	Walker declined to put a figure on losses.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_262.wav	3.80	They made such decisions in London.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_263.wav	3.12	The proposal was rejected.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_264.wav	4.61	This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_265.wav	3.93	Some changes have been achieved at great cost.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_266.wav	2.86	Everyone wanted him to win.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_267.wav	2.30	I was totally wrong.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_268.wav	4.78	I may play with two players up, maybe not.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_269.wav	2.78	Others get through it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_270.wav	2.18	I knew him well.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_271.wav	4.44	I see no reason to doubt that the situation in Scotland is any different.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_272.wav	2.86	All films open tomorrow)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_273.wav	4.14	If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_274.wav	2.95	The third has yet to be named.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_275.wav	5.04	He was called in by the government last year to report on pension reform.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_276.wav	4.65	Scots police had been asked to join the search to find him.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_277.wav	3.37	People realise we have a job to do.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_278.wav	3.12	I'm interested in interesting work.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_279.wav	3.84	It would be nice to be involved in another victory.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_280.wav	3.59	Sales will begin by the end of October.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_281.wav	2.82	He will get his chances.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_282.wav	3.08	Friday night was a pretty good night.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_283.wav	2.14	She now lives in London.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_284.wav	2.09	It's not a small step.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_285.wav	2.99	They have the cash and the fire power.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_286.wav	3.29	The institute board will take the decision.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_287.wav	2.61	He followed the Italian route.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_288.wav	3.33	If not, a deal could take many months.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_289.wav	2.86	You have made your point.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_290.wav	2.69	He died the following year.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_291.wav	2.39	We must move on.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_292.wav	3.42	It's just an area of water.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_293.wav	4.40	Rangers was on the agenda and I am interested.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_294.wav	3.41	If so, we want to hear from them.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_295.wav	3.33	She doesn't know the half of it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_296.wav	2.57	Perhaps they were right.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_297.wav	2.90	Autumn will be a real challenge.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_298.wav	3.29	Many events are down on numbers.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_299.wav	6.06	He had served his time.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_300.wav	3.59	That was around July, August.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_301.wav	4.23	The direct effects on trade will be limited.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_302.wav	3.29	It changed the very language.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_303.wav	3.37	It was finally agreed on Saturday.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_304.wav	4.82	I did so, making the positive case for Scottish New Labour.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_305.wav	2.44	Only one got through.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_306.wav	3.55	He remains a main board director of Royal.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_307.wav	3.07	It's not a marketing scheme.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_308.wav	6.06	There was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_309.wav	3.80	Five years ago its return was rejected.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_310.wav	2.86	He left pretty quickly.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_311.wav	4.87	The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_312.wav	2.57	They might surprise themselves.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_313.wav	4.83	It is his speed off the mark that is so impressive.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_314.wav	3.29	Hibs are playing with style now.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_315.wav	3.46	Such a policy is for long-term strength.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_316.wav	3.25	This is extremely positive news.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_317.wav	2.56	Other teams moved up too.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_318.wav	2.99	I just felt like a dead loss.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_319.wav	3.33	Not one person spoke badly.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_320.wav	3.33	The performance continues to improve.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_321.wav	2.99	We want immediate action.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_322.wav	3.50	Our relationship has been very good.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_323.wav	2.65	Someone should tell them.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_324.wav	3.03	They really had a go at us.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_325.wav	2.86	They should try to get tickets.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_326.wav	4.14	The change could come as soon as September.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_327.wav	3.54	They emerged before the patients left hospital.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_328.wav	2.48	He did not say that.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_329.wav	3.50	We are a husband and wife team.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_330.wav	3.03	I can't get away from it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_331.wav	2.82	He had played very well.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_332.wav	4.87	Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_333.wav	3.46	That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_334.wav	3.80	I saw one man vote five times.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_335.wav	2.56	It's quite crucial for me.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_336.wav	3.50	This fact is supported by audience research.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_337.wav	4.14	The regional government faces key elections next May.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_339.wav	4.82	Time remains to put other candidates forward.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_340.wav	4.31	In Great Britain, it has a life of its own.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_341.wav	4.40	This deal is a great boost for the Borders.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_342.wav	3.76	An opera company needs to have its orchestra.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_343.wav	5.72	The European elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_344.wav	5.04	I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_345.wav	2.60	I believe they are dead.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_346.wav	3.12	We have no information on Iraq.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_347.wav	5.29	We had to approach it the way we feel we can do best.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_348.wav	3.46	It looks at public interest issues.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_349.wav	3.07	The book is closed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_350.wav	3.33	I would be very keen on a move to Italy.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_351.wav	3.12	He is fully fit.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_352.wav	3.16	That would concern me lot.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_353.wav	2.73	It's clearly a budget.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_354.wav	3.12	Both watched her win yesterday.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_355.wav	2.82	Her father had died recently.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_356.wav	2.39	We accept the new rules.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_357.wav	2.31	Neil knows the score.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_358.wav	2.69	He could still be President.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_359.wav	3.41	It had been introduced over six years.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_360.wav	4.52	Blair is very positive at European Councils.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_361.wav	3.76	It shows we're not much of a rugby country.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_362.wav	2.95	Her body has never been found.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_363.wav	5.55	The purchase was widely criticised by both analysts and investors.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_364.wav	4.44	They had to have hospital treatment.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_365.wav	5.59	I would never even consider it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_366.wav	4.14	Five local people were injured.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_367.wav	4.44	It has helped focus attention on junior golf.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_368.wav	3.80	We've had some pretty bad times.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_369.wav	3.29	That is for white people.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_370.wav	3.03	Neither had any other career.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_371.wav	5.38	Without rules, the elections could not go ahead, he stressed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_372.wav	2.91	I took my chance.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_373.wav	4.14	It has the potential to be another North Sea.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_374.wav	2.86	It was exactly four months away.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_375.wav	3.33	We have a high quality product.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_376.wav	3.97	He was always Scottish Labour, or simply Labour.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_377.wav	4.10	It would have to look for outside funding.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_378.wav	3.29	John gave up everything to be with me.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_379.wav	6.28	He had wanted to play, but we had to be responsible about the decision we took.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_380.wav	3.20	I have been going through a lot of things.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_381.wav	4.35	People could have a post box in the local post office.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_382.wav	4.18	If we get a penalty next week I want to take it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_383.wav	3.29	This is too much like Scotland.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_385.wav	3.84	His third child was born in April.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_386.wav	3.76	They want the style of the sound changed a bit.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_387.wav	3.03	Young people will always run away.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_388.wav	2.86	The view is impressive.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_389.wav	4.35	Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_390.wav	4.14	It is the same with Barry.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_391.wav	3.07	The experts got it wrong.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_392.wav	3.16	We have done our own tests.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_393.wav	3.67	No, because they look good boys.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_394.wav	4.83	His deal is effective for two years, starting in July.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_395.wav	2.69	We learned two things.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_396.wav	3.55	It has been only average.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_397.wav	4.27	It was either Wednesday or Thursday, he said.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_398.wav	2.69	It was an attitude thing.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_399.wav	2.78	But it is her picture.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_400.wav	2.73	The tickets are on their way.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_401.wav	3.76	He plays only for himself.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_402.wav	3.63	They have quick front players, but so do we.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_403.wav	4.35	We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_404.wav	3.33	It was that kind of match.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_405.wav	5.85	Good records have always been recognised by successful farmers.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_406.wav	3.03	The songs are just so good.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_407.wav	2.09	So I moved on.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_408.wav	5.12	That view was confirmed by Welsh coach Graham Henry.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_409.wav	2.86	You took the law into your own hands.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_410.wav	4.27	But British scientists were not convinced by the findings.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_411.wav	3.46	They like big name players.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_412.wav	5.59	Financial services also saw a sharp reduction in new business.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_413.wav	2.35	Williams said the same.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_414.wav	2.65	I was the sheep.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_415.wav	2.95	I've learned a huge amount from Michael.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_416.wav	5.08	A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_417.wav	3.33	A report will be issued by March.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_418.wav	4.48	The legislation is expected to be introduced next spring.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_419.wav	3.85	We didn't really have to power up.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_420.wav	3.50	He is very fast all right.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_421.wav	3.03	They could change them tomorrow.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_422.wav	2.69	We have some options there.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_423.wav	3.16	This man must be helped to keep his arm.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_424.wav	3.25	Our performance wasn't perfect.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_425.wav	3.88	Those overseas offices were great.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_426.wav	2.44	She had black eyes.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_427.wav	4.23	In practice, the economic tests have to be met.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_428.wav	2.61	I have to protect them.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_429.wav	2.60	The people are nice, though.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_430.wav	2.61	Equipment is also a problem.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_431.wav	3.03	We cannot ask for them back.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_432.wav	2.86	The tie isn't over.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_433.wav	2.73	He doesn't need to hit people.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_434.wav	2.69	A job is a job, after all.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_435.wav	2.22	It all came good.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_436.wav	2.01	It was a hard fight.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_437.wav	2.39	Special measures were needed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_438.wav	5.46	However, the proposal is not aimed at rugby, but at all sports.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_439.wav	3.25	Colin Cameron was excellent.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_440.wav	3.50	That approach has passed its sell by date.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_441.wav	5.51	Sir George said every company in the country has this issue at the moment.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_442.wav	3.25	WE all watch the same match.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_443.wav	3.89	We would deal first with the biggest party.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_444.wav	3.24	The company was set up six years ago.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_445.wav	3.33	It was an outstanding performance.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_446.wav	4.18	The three previous winners also came from Scotland.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_447.wav	2.90	In the old days, it was easy.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_448.wav	3.25	Powers looks straight ahead.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_449.wav	3.42	The festival runs until Tuesday.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_450.wav	3.84	We are unable to provide support for future issues.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_451.wav	2.86	These days are past.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_452.wav	6.19	The official also said no groups had made any terrorist claims involving the crash.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_453.wav	2.86	They finished second and third.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_454.wav	3.33	He was then replaced by Ross.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_455.wav	3.84	They thought he was asking the right questions.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_456.wav	2.39	It had been accepted.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_457.wav	2.31	The truth was rather different.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_458.wav	2.56	The technology looks excellent.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_459.wav	4.23	The party had high hopes of taking the seat from Labour.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_460.wav	3.12	We have very limited capacity.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_461.wav	5.17	In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_462.wav	3.50	They're interested only in profits.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_463.wav	3.33	That does not take much training.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_464.wav	3.03	Scotland needs this award.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_465.wav	3.50	He enjoyed being with his family.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_466.wav	4.01	It's a strategy which would work beyond this show.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_467.wav	2.35	This is a big advantage.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_468.wav	3.07	He dismissed the action.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_469.wav	4.83	If they gave me free electricity I still wouldn't support the plans.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_470.wav	3.12	It is an industry failure.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_471.wav	3.03	Each year they cut them down a bit.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_472.wav	3.42	We showed some spirit against Newcastle.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_473.wav	3.67	It's a tough old job to get for your first job.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_474.wav	3.29	I've got to win here to be happy.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_475.wav	2.82	I'm delighted for Andy.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_476.wav	2.56	Tell us about it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_477.wav	2.91	The child has denied murder.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_478.wav	4.40	The union has threatened strike action unless these demands are met.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_479.wav	2.43	We were given a break.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_480.wav	3.76	The first four teams were all inside the previous record.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_481.wav	3.42	The parties include the Scottish Executive.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_482.wav	4.65	I'd like my TV programmes to be simple, but not too simple.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_483.wav	3.63	Your bank may offer you a choice of options.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_484.wav	2.99	That is surely worth a try.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_485.wav	2.77	I believe in theatre.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_486.wav	3.50	The accident seemed so simple.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_487.wav	2.95	Her father wasn't best pleased.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_488.wav	3.16	Just look at his fashion sense.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_489.wav	2.78	That time may never be broken.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_490.wav	2.61	We've got good options.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_491.wav	3.16	This operation will change her life.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_492.wav	2.39	New York is my home.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_493.wav	5.64	He added that trading data for the new stores would be revealed in due course.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_494.wav	3.97	That means a ban on French products.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p264\p264_495.wav	4.82	This is yet another example of double standards from headquarters.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_002.wav	5.08	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_003.wav	9.60	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_004.wav	7.09	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_005.wav	8.37	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_006.wav	8.07	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_007.wav	5.76	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_008.wav	10.07	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_010.wav	4.14	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_011.wav	8.49	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_012.wav	6.15	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_013.wav	5.76	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_014.wav	6.62	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_015.wav	8.92	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_016.wav	8.24	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_017.wav	5.00	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_018.wav	7.64	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_019.wav	10.25	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_020.wav	5.76	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_021.wav	11.35	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_022.wav	8.75	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_023.wav	15.75	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_024.wav	9.52	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_025.wav	3.07	Is this accurate?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_026.wav	4.83	However, the following year the cancer returned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_027.wav	6.27	They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_028.wav	2.31	This is the window.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_029.wav	3.37	We speak about the performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_030.wav	1.92	It's a fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_031.wav	5.55	Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_032.wav	2.30	It has failed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_033.wav	2.48	It was clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_034.wav	5.89	A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_035.wav	2.95	Indeed, he does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_036.wav	5.89	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_037.wav	2.82	Dancing was her life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_038.wav	5.59	It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_039.wav	2.91	It's the only thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_040.wav	4.40	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_041.wav	2.44	A neighbour said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_042.wav	3.97	Among them are many criminals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_043.wav	3.16	She looked so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_044.wav	3.59	This is a club on the rise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_045.wav	3.50	I guess I was lucky, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_046.wav	2.95	There was no safety net.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_047.wav	2.60	It is unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_048.wav	3.59	I expect a rapid response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_049.wav	3.03	TODAY it begins.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_050.wav	5.68	Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_051.wav	5.50	The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_052.wav	2.99	It's that kind of place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_053.wav	2.39	They are real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_054.wav	3.59	I've spent a lot of time on buses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_055.wav	7.34	Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_056.wav	5.68	I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_057.wav	5.76	Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_058.wav	4.44	He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_059.wav	4.82	Robin Williams is very subdued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_060.wav	3.72	The tournament has now been cancelled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_061.wav	5.17	A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_063.wav	5.25	IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_064.wav	2.99	Neither it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_065.wav	4.70	For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_066.wav	3.42	Is there a new way forward?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_067.wav	5.72	I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_068.wav	3.11	The results are tragic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_069.wav	6.74	Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_070.wav	5.80	It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_071.wav	2.86	What has changed?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_072.wav	4.57	He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_073.wav	4.01	He seems to be pleased with the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_074.wav	3.72	A play is a set of actions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_075.wav	4.05	Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_076.wav	3.55	By then, he was walking on water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_077.wav	5.59	It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_078.wav	2.99	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_079.wav	2.56	It will be tight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_080.wav	5.47	The city council is a major property owner in the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_081.wav	4.87	Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_082.wav	2.56	It is a lifeline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_083.wav	3.97	Maloney is an engaging talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_084.wav	5.25	I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_085.wav	2.57	This one did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_086.wav	3.20	They are now divorced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_087.wav	3.89	I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_088.wav	2.78	I saw the whole thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_089.wav	2.65	It was mayhem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_090.wav	3.12	Journalists should make him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_091.wav	2.82	It is a love affair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_092.wav	6.79	However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_093.wav	4.01	May not have been at fault?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_094.wav	2.99	They tried to deny it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_095.wav	3.55	We have an election in eight days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_096.wav	3.85	Oil embargo endorsed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_097.wav	2.61	He takes the job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_098.wav	3.67	She reflects a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_099.wav	6.92	Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_100.wav	4.35	The cause of the fire is not yet known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_101.wav	4.53	I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_102.wav	5.94	According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_103.wav	4.91	He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_104.wav	1.84	It's a shame.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_105.wav	2.99	It was the eighties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_106.wav	4.95	I did not see any reason to change the captain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_107.wav	2.78	You had better believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_108.wav	2.44	It is rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_109.wav	3.89	Who would be a referee?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_110.wav	6.53	That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_111.wav	5.25	There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_112.wav	2.73	That's all right then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_113.wav	2.69	I'm so angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_114.wav	4.31	Holland won by five wickets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_115.wav	5.89	The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_116.wav	4.78	Twaddle is a case in point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_117.wav	4.52	The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_118.wav	4.61	It plans to return to this field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_119.wav	3.12	They took a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_120.wav	2.99	We work well together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_121.wav	3.03	What will happen then?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_122.wav	4.70	The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_123.wav	6.06	Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_124.wav	6.74	On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_125.wav	2.35	Is that it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_126.wav	2.99	It is a time bomb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_127.wav	2.31	I was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_128.wav	3.03	I don't know the full story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_129.wav	4.52	It seems so long since I did the exams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_130.wav	5.72	And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_131.wav	3.08	She died at her home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_132.wav	3.50	He realises his mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_133.wav	6.10	They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_134.wav	3.46	The idea is simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_135.wav	4.44	That group reported just before Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_136.wav	6.83	He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_137.wav	6.87	Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_138.wav	2.74	You know the type.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_139.wav	2.43	I was stunned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_140.wav	5.21	The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_141.wav	6.57	The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_142.wav	3.59	They have not been named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_143.wav	3.67	We are now up against it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_144.wav	4.91	We are looking for a good performance and a good result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_145.wav	5.76	He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_146.wav	4.61	Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_147.wav	2.99	Well, he should know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_148.wav	2.43	I will tell you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_149.wav	4.23	I've put my own money into this project.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_150.wav	6.19	Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_151.wav	4.01	She is an expert on medical ethics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_152.wav	2.91	It has to be now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_153.wav	6.27	Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_154.wav	3.03	It is not like us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_155.wav	4.83	Seven people were later detained by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_156.wav	5.63	By then, however, both men were already in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_157.wav	3.08	They will do their own thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_158.wav	3.63	You had to go and see him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_159.wav	5.85	It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_160.wav	5.25	They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_161.wav	5.38	Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_162.wav	3.67	Blair's response was weak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_163.wav	6.61	But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_164.wav	7.09	However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_165.wav	6.02	It is not either national standards or local control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_166.wav	2.82	He deserved the win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_167.wav	4.53	I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_168.wav	6.23	Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_169.wav	3.54	They know no other way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_170.wav	2.74	I've been there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_171.wav	2.13	It's an idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_172.wav	6.49	And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_173.wav	6.27	Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_174.wav	5.38	It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_175.wav	3.80	They need to look after themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_176.wav	4.70	I saw military vehicles in the distance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_177.wav	2.61	Does this matter?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_178.wav	3.12	One was a lawyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_179.wav	3.08	I put the drawing down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_180.wav	5.85	Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_181.wav	4.27	Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_182.wav	5.81	But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_183.wav	2.65	It is a farce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_184.wav	2.82	Peace was won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_185.wav	6.10	It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_186.wav	4.01	It was very frightened and dirty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_187.wav	2.82	Is that success?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_188.wav	4.31	The service from the other players was super.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_189.wav	5.12	On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_190.wav	5.89	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_191.wav	4.44	The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_192.wav	5.46	The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_193.wav	4.82	I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_194.wav	4.14	It's all about money, money, money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_195.wav	3.84	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_196.wav	4.82	We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_197.wav	3.25	I don't want to use it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_198.wav	5.51	This gives a financial incentive to switch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_199.wav	6.96	We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_200.wav	4.36	I had decided to quit the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_201.wav	3.67	People must remain vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_202.wav	5.42	So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_203.wav	3.72	He seemed to lose his focus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_204.wav	2.82	I might come back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_205.wav	6.28	The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_206.wav	5.34	He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_207.wav	3.67	Because they didn't want to know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_208.wav	3.29	That has been the easy part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_209.wav	2.82	But she was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_210.wav	6.06	This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_211.wav	3.97	If it doesn't, it doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_212.wav	4.14	I'd never seen a play about me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_213.wav	3.29	It's not before time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_214.wav	3.80	The report is due out next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_215.wav	5.64	I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_216.wav	7.47	Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_217.wav	3.89	At the time, he was a living legend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_218.wav	5.81	Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_219.wav	5.68	Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_220.wav	2.52	We were awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_221.wav	2.56	We are so proud.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_222.wav	4.57	The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_223.wav	4.40	I can leave at the end of the day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_224.wav	2.99	Until they came to do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_225.wav	4.87	Half of young people had had contact with the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_226.wav	3.50	Wealth is relative.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_227.wav	3.76	Well, they were the unlucky ones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_228.wav	2.69	You should be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_229.wav	2.31	It's quite nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_230.wav	5.29	On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_231.wav	5.85	It would still have been a good film, but very different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_232.wav	4.91	I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_233.wav	5.85	He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_234.wav	4.57	In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_235.wav	4.48	Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_236.wav	5.21	I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_237.wav	5.98	In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_238.wav	5.55	We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_239.wav	4.87	In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_240.wav	4.48	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_241.wav	2.22	It was a hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_242.wav	2.65	There's the mix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_243.wav	5.25	The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_244.wav	5.08	I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_245.wav	3.71	That could be in place by next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_246.wav	6.66	For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_247.wav	5.47	There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_248.wav	6.57	However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_249.wav	3.25	Chelsea was a great club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_250.wav	3.12	We have to expand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_251.wav	4.01	It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_252.wav	6.19	Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_253.wav	3.63	Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_254.wav	6.11	However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_255.wav	6.11	This court has made an order which has not been observed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_256.wav	2.82	Souter will be back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_257.wav	3.46	I am just trying to do my job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_258.wav	3.12	Blood samples were taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_259.wav	3.76	They want to shut the Scottish Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_260.wav	3.42	This is a question of Islam.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_262.wav	6.66	Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_263.wav	2.73	It's a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_264.wav	6.41	The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_265.wav	5.29	She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_266.wav	3.59	They seem to get away with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_267.wav	4.40	The record companies have gone through the floor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_268.wav	5.12	In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_269.wav	5.80	In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_270.wav	6.23	Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_271.wav	3.03	We have to break that cycle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_272.wav	2.77	He looked very sharp.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_273.wav	5.25	Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_274.wav	5.76	This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_275.wav	3.97	You've got to have both sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_276.wav	4.87	What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_277.wav	2.94	Dialogue is the key.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_278.wav	2.99	It was a virus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_279.wav	2.82	Yet, it worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_280.wav	5.94	The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_281.wav	3.55	This is a national crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_282.wav	3.80	Who did the recruiting?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_283.wav	3.03	So I did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_284.wav	3.59	We are not going to forget.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_285.wav	3.12	What has altered?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_286.wav	6.44	The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_287.wav	3.54	There is no openness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_288.wav	3.29	I can live with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_289.wav	5.38	In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_290.wav	6.75	The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_291.wav	6.23	They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_292.wav	3.93	Last night was a key episode.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_293.wav	5.16	It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_294.wav	2.90	You are the glory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_295.wav	3.93	The minister is the engineer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_296.wav	4.01	The letters are going out today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_297.wav	5.51	Surely, if anything, it would be the other way around.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_298.wav	2.99	Is there on his hands?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_299.wav	3.88	We are a peaceful people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_300.wav	2.78	Kids are terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_301.wav	4.10	Horses are drawn by ballot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_302.wav	3.63	My body is clearly capable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_303.wav	5.42	Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_304.wav	5.04	They had a confession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_305.wav	2.69	It will work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_306.wav	3.80	I came into this world with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_307.wav	3.63	It's too horrible to think.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_308.wav	3.88	Either team will be hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_309.wav	5.25	But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_310.wav	3.97	My view has now completely changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_311.wav	2.91	The party is up for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_312.wav	2.61	Is that an issue?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_313.wav	4.01	Finally, he paid for the movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_314.wav	5.72	In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_315.wav	4.48	The same things will happen with GM foods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_316.wav	3.16	Who will do it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_317.wav	4.74	That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_318.wav	5.42	Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_319.wav	3.37	Two people were interviewed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_320.wav	2.31	I'm very lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_321.wav	2.95	It's very good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_322.wav	3.37	This is a friendly match?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_323.wav	5.85	I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_324.wav	4.06	They should take their mobile phones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_325.wav	4.91	From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_326.wav	5.29	The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_327.wav	2.56	Tell us about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_328.wav	3.12	She said they would appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_329.wav	3.71	But we finished the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_330.wav	4.69	Both of those promises have already been honoured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_331.wav	2.65	There is no excuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_332.wav	5.81	The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_333.wav	3.54	The pair are very much in love.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_334.wav	3.54	As, indeed, they would be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_335.wav	3.80	It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_336.wav	5.47	Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_337.wav	5.16	The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_338.wav	2.09	That would help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_339.wav	5.98	Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_340.wav	5.42	On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_341.wav	6.02	It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_342.wav	4.18	There was a substantial explosion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_343.wav	4.61	It's not pretty, but it's effective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_344.wav	3.76	He could face a jail sentence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_345.wav	5.80	We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_346.wav	2.35	It's been hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_347.wav	6.32	The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_348.wav	2.99	A review is under way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_349.wav	3.67	Safety was also an issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_350.wav	3.03	So there, we won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_351.wav	2.65	He was the architect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p265\p265_352.wav	5.08	I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_001.wav	2.14	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_002.wav	3.63	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_003.wav	6.53	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_004.wav	4.57	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_005.wav	5.89	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_006.wav	5.81	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_007.wav	4.53	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_008.wav	7.00	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_009.wav	4.44	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_010.wav	3.29	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_011.wav	6.45	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_012.wav	4.66	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_013.wav	4.61	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_014.wav	4.87	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_015.wav	5.76	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_016.wav	7.22	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_017.wav	4.87	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_018.wav	6.02	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_019.wav	7.60	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_020.wav	4.57	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_021.wav	8.96	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_022.wav	6.53	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_023.wav	11.18	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_024.wav	6.57	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_025.wav	2.56	She looked so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_026.wav	4.23	Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_027.wav	1.88	Is this accurate?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_028.wav	3.12	Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_029.wav	2.18	There's a story, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_030.wav	4.40	They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_031.wav	2.56	Then, suddenly, they weren't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_032.wav	2.99	IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_033.wav	3.84	Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_034.wav	3.21	However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_035.wav	1.63	It was clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_036.wav	3.59	A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_037.wav	1.75	Indeed, he does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_038.wav	3.63	People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_039.wav	3.50	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_040.wav	2.05	Dancing was her life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_041.wav	1.62	It's the only thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_042.wav	4.31	It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_043.wav	3.93	The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_044.wav	1.88	A neighbour said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_045.wav	2.74	Among them are many criminals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_046.wav	2.05	Is a drug dealer?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_047.wav	3.12	The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_048.wav	3.55	In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_049.wav	3.71	No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_050.wav	2.61	There was a substantial explosion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_051.wav	4.69	Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_052.wav	3.80	He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_053.wav	2.52	I expect a rapid response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_054.wav	2.14	What was the main difference?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_055.wav	3.67	We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_056.wav	1.92	They're appalled by that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_057.wav	4.27	Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_058.wav	4.05	There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_059.wav	1.75	We should have known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_060.wav	2.90	Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_061.wav	2.90	We recorded it at our own expense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_062.wav	1.88	Try to save us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_063.wav	2.13	Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_064.wav	3.67	Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_065.wav	2.61	Painful, but only because it's true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_066.wav	2.56	He was at home with his pals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_067.wav	2.09	It's all I can do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_068.wav	2.27	I was as strong as a horse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_069.wav	3.03	Then followed a bout of flu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_070.wav	4.78	Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_071.wav	2.01	Neither it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_072.wav	2.99	It is a job creation scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_073.wav	2.01	It works for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_074.wav	2.05	The party is up for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_075.wav	2.31	Even the one she loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_076.wav	2.44	Today she has been released.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_077.wav	2.82	The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_078.wav	1.67	I will miss him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_079.wav	2.05	He is in the queue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_080.wav	2.52	I first met him last summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_081.wav	3.33	He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_082.wav	1.97	He is driven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_083.wav	2.48	He seems to be pleased with the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_084.wav	3.33	Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_085.wav	1.92	Someone who cares
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_086.wav	4.18	It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_087.wav	2.09	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_088.wav	2.26	It will be tight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_089.wav	1.88	It is a lifeline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_090.wav	4.52	Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_091.wav	1.80	It's good news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_092.wav	3.54	That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_093.wav	4.01	Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_094.wav	1.71	I love the Dome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_095.wav	4.27	We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_096.wav	2.73	I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_097.wav	1.80	I saw the whole thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_098.wav	3.38	Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_099.wav	2.01	Journalists should make him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_100.wav	2.65	May not have been at fault?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_101.wav	3.33	Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_102.wav	2.61	Here, again, they were denied a voice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_103.wav	1.92	That would be unlawful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_104.wav	2.78	Oil embargo endorsed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_105.wav	1.75	He takes the job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_106.wav	1.79	She reflects a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_107.wav	4.14	Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_108.wav	5.42	Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_109.wav	4.14	It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_110.wav	3.41	While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_111.wav	1.88	It was a funny game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_112.wav	3.80	According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_113.wav	1.62	Is that right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_114.wav	2.90	It is a total and utter change of culture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_115.wav	2.74	He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_116.wav	1.45	It's a shame.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_117.wav	1.84	It was the eighties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_118.wav	3.24	I did not see any reason to change the captain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_119.wav	3.12	In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_120.wav	5.12	Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_121.wav	2.95	There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_122.wav	1.58	Who would have?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_123.wav	4.18	We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_124.wav	2.48	There were no grounds for his action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_125.wav	1.62	I'm so angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_126.wav	3.46	It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_127.wav	1.92	I was on a roll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_128.wav	2.99	The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_129.wav	3.21	We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_130.wav	1.88	We work well together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_131.wav	2.78	The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_132.wav	3.67	Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_133.wav	3.71	Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_134.wav	4.14	On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_135.wav	4.61	It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_136.wav	1.45	Is that it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_137.wav	3.97	He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_138.wav	1.41	I was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_139.wav	2.61	I don't know the full story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_140.wav	3.89	And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_141.wav	1.84	Who would be right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_142.wav	1.88	She died at her home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_143.wav	2.44	He realises his mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_144.wav	4.57	He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_145.wav	2.05	I was awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_146.wav	3.08	That group reported just before Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_147.wav	4.65	He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_148.wav	2.65	It is not just about pay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_149.wav	4.87	Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_150.wav	2.52	So I got a blood test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_151.wav	4.14	But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_152.wav	2.27	The weather forecast isn't good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_153.wav	4.48	The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_154.wav	2.22	They have not been named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_155.wav	1.84	I might come back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_156.wav	3.50	We are looking for a good performance and a good result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_157.wav	2.22	My Dad is a hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_158.wav	3.76	For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_159.wav	3.59	This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_160.wav	1.67	There's a pause.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_161.wav	2.60	Was this element always there?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_162.wav	3.07	I've put my own money into this project.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_163.wav	4.44	Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_164.wav	2.48	We need a new kind of theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_165.wav	2.82	I haven't had a lesson in four years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_166.wav	4.52	Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_167.wav	2.18	We try to keep it right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_168.wav	2.99	Seven people were later detained by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_169.wav	4.06	It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_170.wav	3.76	By then, however, both men were already in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_171.wav	3.33	Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_172.wav	2.86	She said she would not welcome the flowers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_173.wav	4.14	It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_174.wav	2.86	They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_175.wav	2.39	One season, they might do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_176.wav	2.01	Is Saddam a threat?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_177.wav	1.62	As we worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_178.wav	4.06	However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_179.wav	3.07	I'm just going to hit the shot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_180.wav	4.06	Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_181.wav	1.67	I've been there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_182.wav	4.27	And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_183.wav	2.99	It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_184.wav	2.91	I saw military vehicles in the distance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_186.wav	4.14	What has caused the demise of singing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_187.wav	2.31	Our team is just so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_188.wav	1.96	O Neill has delivered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_189.wav	4.99	Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_190.wav	4.06	But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_191.wav	3.46	It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_192.wav	2.52	I came home by ambulance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_193.wav	4.05	The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_194.wav	1.58	Is that success?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_195.wav	3.59	The service from the other players was super.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_196.wav	1.96	Tommy is not a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_197.wav	3.54	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_198.wav	2.01	Who will pay for this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_199.wav	3.67	The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_200.wav	1.41	It's just awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_201.wav	2.52	It's all about money, money, money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_202.wav	3.25	It's a question of creating a future awareness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_203.wav	1.92	He knows a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_204.wav	4.27	We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_205.wav	2.31	It had all been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_206.wav	1.96	It's not before time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_207.wav	3.37	So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_208.wav	2.13	We want to keep the pound.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_209.wav	1.79	I was so nervous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_210.wav	2.18	He seemed to lose his focus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_211.wav	1.88	Work has started.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_212.wav	4.01	The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_213.wav	3.97	On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_214.wav	3.93	But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_215.wav	3.50	During the communist time they were very privileged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_216.wav	4.23	This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_217.wav	1.79	Saturday is gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_218.wav	2.65	Because they didn't want to know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_219.wav	3.20	The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_220.wav	2.01	If it doesn't, it doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_221.wav	2.18	Clearly, the stakes are high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_222.wav	1.62	I will win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_223.wav	3.63	It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_224.wav	2.52	The report is due out next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_225.wav	1.54	We were awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_226.wav	2.05	They tried to give her advice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_227.wav	3.59	They have now become the focus of a huge police inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_228.wav	2.43	They will be stopped, and they will be punished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_229.wav	3.29	Half of young people had had contact with the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_230.wav	1.88	There is no excuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_231.wav	1.62	It's quite nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_232.wav	3.25	It would still have been a good film, but very different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_233.wav	3.03	Of further privacy, he had no need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_234.wav	1.67	It's a killer piece.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_235.wav	3.37	I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_236.wav	2.95	In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_237.wav	1.92	It is hard won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_238.wav	4.40	It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_239.wav	2.52	You can feel at home in China.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_240.wav	1.88	The scene is about this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_241.wav	3.97	The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_242.wav	4.01	We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_243.wav	2.48	My son was too young to die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_244.wav	3.20	In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_245.wav	2.01	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_246.wav	1.54	It was a hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_247.wav	1.67	There's the mix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_248.wav	3.07	There will be widespread support on all sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_249.wav	3.46	He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_250.wav	1.71	We are in a war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_251.wav	4.10	For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_252.wav	3.71	It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_253.wav	3.29	That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_254.wav	2.65	It was like the old days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_255.wav	4.52	However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_256.wav	1.84	Chelsea was a great club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_257.wav	3.42	It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_258.wav	2.01	We have to expand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_259.wav	3.59	However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_260.wav	2.05	Souter will be back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_261.wav	1.67	Note the date.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_262.wav	2.18	It will be done in stages.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_263.wav	3.76	That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_264.wav	2.18	You take a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_265.wav	4.36	He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_266.wav	3.63	I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_267.wav	2.86	He was also married with two children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_268.wav	2.18	The system can work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_269.wav	4.52	We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_270.wav	4.44	It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_271.wav	1.67	We're in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_272.wav	2.65	Our objective is to tackle poverty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_273.wav	4.31	Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_274.wav	2.31	That goes back a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_275.wav	1.79	It was very fast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_276.wav	1.97	She failed in her action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_277.wav	3.42	He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_278.wav	2.10	They seem to get away with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_279.wav	3.46	He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_280.wav	1.67	It's so awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_281.wav	3.46	It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_282.wav	3.76	Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_283.wav	3.67	Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_284.wav	3.97	Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_285.wav	2.05	Dialogue is the key.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_286.wav	2.77	They have shown a great desire and attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_287.wav	2.26	Tony Blair said as little.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_288.wav	2.90	She is an expert on medical ethics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_289.wav	1.41	It was good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_290.wav	1.92	Who did the recruiting?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_291.wav	2.52	Bombing slaughter rejected
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_292.wav	3.63	It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_293.wav	2.39	It could well be military.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_294.wav	2.39	No Briton has ever won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_295.wav	2.90	Robin Williams is very subdued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_296.wav	2.65	Spent three months alone at sea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_297.wav	4.27	He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_298.wav	1.67	There was a vacuum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_299.wav	1.75	We lost a boy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_300.wav	2.73	Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_301.wav	2.65	I was brought up in a mining background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_302.wav	4.65	In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_303.wav	3.63	Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_304.wav	4.06	The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_305.wav	3.97	The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_306.wav	2.22	I can give no comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_307.wav	4.87	But the military campaign is a military campaign against Osama bin Laden.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_308.wav	2.44	This is a war over our home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_309.wav	3.76	Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_310.wav	1.71	The plot is minimal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_311.wav	4.10	They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_312.wav	1.45	You should be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_313.wav	2.22	The minister is the engineer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_314.wav	3.84	I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_315.wav	2.69	We have got no money to go anywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_316.wav	2.05	Your father was a good man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_317.wav	1.96	We are a peaceful people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_318.wav	2.01	You may have a short memory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_319.wav	2.48	The problems began a long time ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_320.wav	3.76	Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_321.wav	3.54	In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_322.wav	2.05	A review is under way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_323.wav	1.71	We are in the end game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_324.wav	2.13	It's too horrible to think.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_325.wav	1.97	The airport was even different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_326.wav	3.59	They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_327.wav	1.84	There was no time scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_328.wav	3.84	But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_329.wav	2.26	Is there a new way forward?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_330.wav	4.57	On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_331.wav	2.18	Finally, he paid for the movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_332.wav	3.33	However, they will only be found in the wild.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_333.wav	2.86	Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_334.wav	1.58	Who will do it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_335.wav	2.69	Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_336.wav	3.37	Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_337.wav	1.92	Two people were interviewed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_338.wav	2.05	We've tried every other way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_339.wav	1.67	This is a big advantage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_340.wav	1.84	Maloney was asked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_341.wav	2.39	But I was knocked out by the city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_342.wav	1.41	went on sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_343.wav	1.33	I'm very lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_344.wav	3.63	Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_345.wav	4.10	A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_346.wav	1.67	It is long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_347.wav	3.80	The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_348.wav	1.63	Tell us about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_349.wav	2.18	There may be reasons for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_350.wav	2.35	I believe the gap is nearly there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_351.wav	4.18	Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_352.wav	3.03	Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_353.wav	1.37	She is free.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_354.wav	3.37	Both of those promises have already been honoured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_355.wav	3.42	You must have a government and a good civil service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_356.wav	2.43	Yet he left a few days later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_357.wav	2.30	You have to rely on each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_358.wav	2.22	It was one in the afternoon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_359.wav	1.50	We will be homeless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_360.wav	4.02	Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_361.wav	4.18	It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_362.wav	2.78	Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_363.wav	2.05	This is a club on the rise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_364.wav	1.75	Not so, it seems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_365.wav	2.22	He was also a great man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_366.wav	1.50	He could make it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_367.wav	3.50	We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_368.wav	2.69	He has been in a nursing home for two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_369.wav	2.43	It's now down in black and white.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_370.wav	2.52	Twaddle is a case in point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_371.wav	3.85	Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_372.wav	2.14	It is a simple equation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_373.wav	1.71	So there, we won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_374.wav	1.54	But I managed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_375.wav	2.99	By that time, however, it was already too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_376.wav	1.92	There is no signature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_377.wav	1.92	The task is enormous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_378.wav	3.59	I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_379.wav	1.88	I am a wealthy person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_380.wav	2.31	Colour was at the core of his life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_381.wav	2.69	He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_382.wav	3.25	Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_384.wav	1.80	It's like a car crash.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_385.wav	3.16	Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_386.wav	4.23	Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_387.wav	3.59	Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_388.wav	2.35	Does that put pressure on us?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_389.wav	3.07	On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_390.wav	1.67	It is unusual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_391.wav	3.84	In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_392.wav	3.80	A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_393.wav	2.78	Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_394.wav	1.79	They are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_395.wav	3.80	He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_396.wav	2.26	It was a breathtaking moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_397.wav	3.16	So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_398.wav	2.26	What happened in the summer?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_399.wav	3.46	Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_400.wav	2.30	But, in fact, the reverse is true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_401.wav	1.96	Emotions were complex.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_402.wav	3.12	He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_403.wav	1.46	So I did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_404.wav	2.18	It's an absolute nonsense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_405.wav	1.88	I knew the script.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_406.wav	2.35	They were kept there for a summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_407.wav	2.43	The weekly average was three hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_408.wav	2.35	Relief was beyond belief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_409.wav	4.61	Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_410.wav	1.75	He got his degree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_411.wav	3.97	The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_412.wav	3.41	In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_413.wav	3.37	Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_414.wav	2.22	But we finished the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_415.wav	2.10	He was really great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_416.wav	4.61	Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_417.wav	4.18	The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_418.wav	1.71	That may be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_419.wav	2.09	It is legally binding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_420.wav	2.31	Paris is not only young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_421.wav	1.80	Such as it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_422.wav	2.26	It looked like a war zone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_423.wav	2.90	I've invented a village in East Lothian.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p266\p266_424.wav	2.56	I chose to make a film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_001.wav	2.18	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_002.wav	3.72	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_003.wav	7.34	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_004.wav	5.38	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_005.wav	5.59	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_006.wav	5.25	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_007.wav	3.89	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_008.wav	6.91	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_009.wav	4.69	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_010.wav	3.67	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_011.wav	6.79	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_012.wav	4.87	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_013.wav	4.44	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_014.wav	4.91	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_015.wav	5.77	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_016.wav	6.53	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_017.wav	3.84	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_018.wav	5.68	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_019.wav	6.87	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_020.wav	5.29	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_021.wav	9.13	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_022.wav	6.70	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_023.wav	11.74	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_024.wav	6.92	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_025.wav	3.84	A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_026.wav	3.37	He may not need to force that message.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_027.wav	2.69	There is no reason at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_028.wav	3.80	Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_029.wav	2.39	Because we do not need it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_030.wav	2.18	We will look into it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_031.wav	2.10	This is a central issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_032.wav	3.12	Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_033.wav	5.29	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_034.wav	3.24	I became a widow overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_035.wav	3.20	You must always attempt to raise the bar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_036.wav	3.25	A week is a long time in politics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_037.wav	3.33	Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_038.wav	3.37	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_039.wav	3.42	She hopes to study in Britain one day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_040.wav	2.65	It is difficult for Ali.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_041.wav	3.16	The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_042.wav	2.18	He is too weak to move.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_043.wav	2.39	Everything else is a bonus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_044.wav	2.65	This is the interesting part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_045.wav	2.14	I guess I was lucky, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_046.wav	2.69	Pulled a huge number of viewers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_047.wav	3.50	Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_048.wav	2.35	There was no safety net.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_049.wav	3.16	They just thought it was extremely good acting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_050.wav	2.61	It is a different animal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_051.wav	3.29	The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_052.wav	2.35	I must take a seat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_053.wav	3.72	In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_054.wav	2.73	Four other charges were dropped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_055.wav	2.26	So I liked the challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_056.wav	3.50	He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_057.wav	2.69	That way I won't have to do anything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_058.wav	2.65	It's just the timing of the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_059.wav	3.29	Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_060.wav	2.82	We need to increase the membership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_061.wav	2.48	He was at home with his pals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_062.wav	2.35	They are in the euro.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_063.wav	2.99	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_064.wav	2.10	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_065.wav	2.14	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_066.wav	2.31	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_067.wav	2.35	There could be a way back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_068.wav	3.59	They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_069.wav	3.03	Her body was found on Monday morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_070.wav	3.46	They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_071.wav	4.10	Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_072.wav	2.90	A government is a government is a government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_073.wav	3.84	Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_074.wav	2.31	That is bound to happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_075.wav	2.26	He is in the queue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_076.wav	2.78	He seems to be pleased with the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_077.wav	3.16	Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_078.wav	2.44	He can win every week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_079.wav	2.77	By then, he was walking on water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_080.wav	2.39	It's so hard to shift.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_081.wav	2.26	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_082.wav	3.12	The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_083.wav	3.12	There was no way back for United after that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_084.wav	3.42	This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_085.wav	3.80	That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_086.wav	2.99	They need to find a form of words.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_087.wav	3.97	A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_088.wav	2.86	It's for that reason he should resign.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_089.wav	3.12	The rescue package is public money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_090.wav	3.03	Before the game we went for a pint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_091.wav	2.69	Our house was very small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_092.wav	2.26	They were a lovely couple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_093.wav	3.50	While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_094.wav	2.43	It's not a lack of effort.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_095.wav	2.90	That means an extra two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_096.wav	3.16	Then came the collision with Sergio.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_097.wav	3.46	It is a total and utter change of culture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_098.wav	2.26	Sport is good for you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_099.wav	2.22	We need to handle it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_100.wav	2.31	They will notice a difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_102.wav	2.91	Such actions are rarely popular.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_103.wav	2.90	He has done that with a great deal to spare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_104.wav	2.35	Then again, we could have.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_105.wav	2.35	She's got to say something.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_106.wav	2.56	I was always a little behind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_107.wav	2.61	There were no grounds for his action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_108.wav	2.86	That admission is not surprising.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_109.wav	2.39	We have a training class.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_110.wav	2.52	Well, you can have a tree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_111.wav	2.56	Becoming a father was wonderful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_112.wav	2.18	I was on a roll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_113.wav	1.97	What do we do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_114.wav	1.97	Why do it otherwise ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_115.wav	3.29	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_116.wav	3.07	The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_117.wav	2.99	Something will be done by corporate bodies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_118.wav	2.90	We did what we had to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_119.wav	2.39	I am the Son of Sam.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_120.wav	2.39	You've got to be vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_121.wav	2.18	Tiger is not the norm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_122.wav	2.65	My conscience is not clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_123.wav	2.94	Nobody in the world can get away from him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_124.wav	2.48	It would make a lot of sense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_125.wav	2.27	They could use a boost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_126.wav	4.23	He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_127.wav	4.06	Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_128.wav	3.25	They scored with a penalty and a breakaway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_129.wav	2.31	He was seen as the enemy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_130.wav	3.29	That group reported just before Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_131.wav	4.05	Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_132.wav	3.89	Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_133.wav	2.31	It was a piece of art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_134.wav	2.82	I am just trying to do my job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_135.wav	2.43	So I got a blood test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_136.wav	2.86	It has become a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_137.wav	2.73	I was caught out a little bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_138.wav	3.84	The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_139.wav	2.01	It has to be an event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_140.wav	2.60	It was deployed in the Gulf War.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_141.wav	3.33	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_142.wav	2.73	She had gone to the Catholic school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_143.wav	2.86	It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_144.wav	2.31	It was by the numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_145.wav	2.31	We will turn the corner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_146.wav	3.76	This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_147.wav	2.74	Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_148.wav	2.65	There was a definite prejudice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_149.wav	3.37	Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_150.wav	3.55	Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_151.wav	2.99	Adams is surely worth a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_152.wav	2.39	That is not too bad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_153.wav	2.65	We are still getting over it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_154.wav	2.18	As, indeed, they would be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_155.wav	2.99	We came across the first set of bodies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_156.wav	3.37	Seven people were later detained by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_157.wav	2.78	I would probably have to agree with him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_158.wav	3.25	We were given a warm and friendly reception.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_159.wav	3.25	However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_160.wav	2.65	Nobody did in those days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_161.wav	2.65	So what is the campaign about ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_162.wav	1.63	And does it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_163.wav	2.14	Are you from the rugby ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_164.wav	1.96	Had I heard ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_165.wav	2.90	Well, this article is a bit like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_166.wav	2.05	It's nice to be nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_167.wav	2.18	The people are the hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_168.wav	2.61	I always felt they played for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_169.wav	3.42	It is premature to speculate on the impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_170.wav	2.91	They made such decisions in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_171.wav	2.39	It is a body blow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_172.wav	3.71	First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_173.wav	3.03	It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_174.wav	2.10	It is not a threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_175.wav	2.14	I would not count on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_176.wav	2.22	He played it like a veteran.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_177.wav	2.56	I have spoken to head office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_178.wav	3.03	The referee had a good game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_179.wav	3.33	The European Union is a case in point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_180.wav	2.90	They need to look after themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_181.wav	2.39	It is a common problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_182.wav	2.22	A team is a team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_183.wav	2.48	Aberdeen had little to offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_184.wav	3.55	It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_185.wav	2.35	It was a pre-emptive strike.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_186.wav	2.57	A terrorist is a terrorist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_187.wav	2.39	People will ask about us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_188.wav	2.56	I had come back from London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_189.wav	3.80	This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_190.wav	2.69	It's very difficult to find a buyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_191.wav	3.46	Final proposals will be published in February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_192.wav	2.73	Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_193.wav	2.14	If I was a woman.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_194.wav	2.61	I came home by ambulance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_195.wav	2.35	I suggest a new plan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_196.wav	2.77	The conference is the first test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_197.wav	2.39	Tommy is not a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_198.wav	4.14	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_199.wav	2.69	He had suffered a heart attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_200.wav	2.91	I won't make an official complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_201.wav	3.07	A bit of match fitness is required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_202.wav	2.56	It is an impressive record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_203.wav	2.35	There is no quick fix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_204.wav	2.44	Abbey National is an option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_205.wav	2.82	It has been like that all year for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_206.wav	2.99	HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_207.wav	3.20	Today we must not repeat that mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_208.wav	2.48	From there, they can go anywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_209.wav	2.14	I had relied on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_210.wav	2.35	The course has helped a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_211.wav	2.35	I'm just a regular person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_212.wav	2.44	My life is in the ballet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_213.wav	3.37	He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_214.wav	2.73	They're going to open in early summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_215.wav	2.69	Anyway, the job will be part-time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_216.wav	3.33	I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_217.wav	2.05	It is good for our team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_218.wav	2.09	It was a crazy day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_219.wav	2.90	Edinburgh was not included in the survey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_220.wav	2.44	Because they didn't want to know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_221.wav	3.12	Women were mostly notable by their absence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_222.wav	2.43	You have to do your research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_223.wav	2.61	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_224.wav	2.05	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_225.wav	2.05	how do you get it back ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_226.wav	1.92	What are you not good at ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_227.wav	2.82	William Hague delighted his party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_228.wav	1.97	You could feel the heat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_229.wav	3.50	Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_230.wav	2.48	The boy is no longer with us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_231.wav	3.07	I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_232.wav	3.50	A small number of new jobs will also be created.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_233.wav	3.03	My wife and family are the support system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_234.wav	2.22	And he goes with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_235.wav	2.48	They tried to give her advice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_236.wav	2.82	Pensions are a long-term investment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_237.wav	2.48	She died in middle age.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_238.wav	2.74	I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_239.wav	2.82	Those overseas offices were great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_240.wav	2.52	You will have seen the adverts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_242.wav	2.39	It is the loss of my name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_243.wav	2.31	The irony was not lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_244.wav	3.24	We have come a long way in the last few sessions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_245.wav	2.69	I am still waiting for a reply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_246.wav	2.43	It is a court case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_247.wav	2.95	He has been a success this year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_248.wav	2.73	It might be sad, but it's a fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_249.wav	2.69	He declined to give any details.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_250.wav	2.43	It seems a waste of talents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_251.wav	3.84	Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_252.wav	3.12	If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_253.wav	2.52	His is a global perspective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_254.wav	3.84	It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_255.wav	3.55	In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_256.wav	3.29	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_257.wav	2.26	It was a cry for help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_258.wav	2.86	They were back in full training yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_259.wav	3.20	No production contract is yet in sight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_260.wav	3.24	Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_261.wav	3.29	There will be widespread support on all sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_262.wav	2.73	The capital costs are modest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_263.wav	2.39	It was the climax of the thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_264.wav	2.52	I can't get a job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_265.wav	3.33	I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_266.wav	2.77	On the contrary they stand to gain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_267.wav	3.63	This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_268.wav	3.16	It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_269.wav	3.16	It does not work that way in Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_270.wav	2.43	It is also very valuable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_271.wav	2.39	It disappeared into the cup.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_272.wav	2.86	The stage was set for a showdown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_273.wav	3.50	Not many companies can say that these days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_274.wav	2.69	He will emerge as a world leader.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_275.wav	3.37	We're trying to get rounded performers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_276.wav	3.67	A lot of their players have developed in the English league.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_277.wav	3.03	It has the potential to be another North Sea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_278.wav	2.18	It is set in Paris.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_279.wav	2.35	He has run a hell of a race.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_280.wav	3.46	It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_281.wav	2.82	He was also married with two children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_282.wav	3.72	It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_283.wav	3.50	It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_284.wav	3.03	They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_285.wav	2.09	That goes back a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_286.wav	2.26	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_287.wav	2.52	was everything done to save people ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_288.wav	2.43	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_289.wav	2.14	Do I think about them often ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_290.wav	2.65	Stephen will get his first cap.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_291.wav	2.48	They were on holiday in Egypt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_292.wav	2.90	The partnership was set up during the summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_293.wav	2.18	We have a plan in place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_294.wav	2.39	I felt like I was a child.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_295.wav	3.16	Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_296.wav	2.22	He wants to talk a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_297.wav	2.52	The attacker died in the crash.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_298.wav	2.78	It is inherent in society.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_299.wav	2.82	He refused to name the survivors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_300.wav	2.74	It's difficult to predict the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_301.wav	2.31	That is the general feeling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_302.wav	2.69	I am a retailer by nature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_303.wav	2.22	Well, he can do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_304.wav	2.74	The weather forecast isn't good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_305.wav	2.35	The judge was really nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_306.wav	2.86	Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_307.wav	2.78	It is a potential danger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_308.wav	2.69	The tournament has now been cancelled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_309.wav	3.50	Cast Away now on general release.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_310.wav	2.26	It is a road of death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_311.wav	3.54	We will make a statement tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_312.wav	2.65	There were no passengers on board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_313.wav	2.82	You will never get a conviction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_314.wav	2.44	I will not be afraid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_316.wav	2.22	He has left the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_317.wav	3.50	I am not concerned with protection of the public.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_318.wav	3.20	People can really get themselves in a mess.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_319.wav	2.86	I would do away with the dress code.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_320.wav	3.54	He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_321.wav	2.99	He has been told by the doctor to rest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_322.wav	2.43	We want to play at the worlds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_323.wav	2.52	After some discussion they did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_325.wav	2.56	It is all credit to them today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_326.wav	3.29	The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_327.wav	1.84	You are looking at him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_328.wav	3.50	This is a source of real concern for the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_329.wav	1.97	It's not an easy life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_330.wav	3.16	The election is total confusion and chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_331.wav	4.19	It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_332.wav	2.65	The problems began a long time ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_333.wav	2.78	It makes a compelling display.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_334.wav	3.16	That is a trend which will be encouraged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_335.wav	2.48	But the New Year was special.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_336.wav	2.52	They are now out in the cold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_337.wav	2.39	There was no time scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_338.wav	2.35	Does that put pressure on us ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_339.wav	1.71	Did it work ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_340.wav	2.65	Do you think we are a top nation ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_341.wav	2.78	It was tough to contain the excitement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_342.wav	2.73	It is a strong case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_343.wav	3.16	A report is expected next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_344.wav	4.01	The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_345.wav	2.05	They were the acts of men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_346.wav	2.44	It wasn't a flight of fancy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_347.wav	2.57	He was then replaced by Ross.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_348.wav	3.67	Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_349.wav	2.31	He is not very big, either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_350.wav	2.18	I have a moral dilemma.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_351.wav	3.20	This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_352.wav	2.52	Finally, he paid for the movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_353.wav	2.69	Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_354.wav	2.82	Some will be deployed on submarines.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_355.wav	2.39	He did a good job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_356.wav	2.56	It intends to do so on Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_357.wav	2.22	It is a stroke of genius.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_358.wav	3.93	In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_359.wav	2.22	We live on an island.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_360.wav	2.82	George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_361.wav	2.22	They have created a business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_362.wav	1.96	I got a yellow card.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_363.wav	2.18	I am considered a teenager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_364.wav	2.39	There may be reasons for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_365.wav	2.65	This is a major championship.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_366.wav	2.35	It's only a matter of scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_367.wav	2.86	She is now on the back benches.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_368.wav	2.78	They were to blame for the first two goals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_369.wav	2.13	There is no deal as yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_370.wav	3.29	You must have a government and a good civil service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_371.wav	2.60	to have products for their needs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_372.wav	2.35	The pair are very much in love.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_373.wav	2.52	They are used to the big stage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_374.wav	2.69	The marshall at the turn was great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_375.wav	3.16	On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_376.wav	2.39	The seller was not revealed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_377.wav	2.05	People are on the alert.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_378.wav	3.21	Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_379.wav	2.43	In fact, he was great today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_380.wav	2.69	We operate as a Scottish company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_381.wav	2.99	He has been in a nursing home for two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_382.wav	2.60	A review is under way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_383.wav	4.40	They have not done so this season so far.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_384.wav	3.12	This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_385.wav	2.48	Safety was also an issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_386.wav	2.52	We have made no final decisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_387.wav	4.66	They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_388.wav	2.99	The results will take second place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_389.wav	2.52	It was a funny game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_390.wav	3.33	I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_391.wav	2.82	It does not even have a staff shortage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_392.wav	2.91	The Cabinet is split over the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_393.wav	2.73	Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_394.wav	3.88	Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_395.wav	2.39	We shall not be moved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_396.wav	2.52	I watch the other visitors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_397.wav	2.86	I remain a buyer of the shares.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_398.wav	3.03	There were no plans for a rights issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_399.wav	2.35	That's all I can say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_400.wav	1.71	Are they free ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_401.wav	1.84	What are they for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_402.wav	1.96	Is there a waiting list ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_403.wav	2.86	Do they think anyone else wants them ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_404.wav	2.31	You thought it was a headache.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_405.wav	4.10	Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_406.wav	2.18	I thought he was an animal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_407.wav	2.86	None of the agencies was able to help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_408.wav	2.39	We will stand for the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_409.wav	2.56	I'm pleased about one thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_410.wav	3.59	In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_411.wav	3.59	The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_412.wav	2.82	My aim is a top six finish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_413.wav	2.26	Such an attack is bizarre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_414.wav	2.52	These guys are looking for business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_415.wav	1.88	He is on the wrong side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_416.wav	3.71	By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_417.wav	2.60	This is no reflection on Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_418.wav	3.76	Further new equity was raised in a placing in January.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_419.wav	2.52	It needs to be volatile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_420.wav	2.18	I've got my own ideas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p267\p267_421.wav	2.69	Nobody should believe this story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_001.wav	3.07	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_002.wav	4.01	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_003.wav	8.66	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_004.wav	5.51	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_005.wav	7.77	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_006.wav	7.34	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_007.wav	5.81	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_009.wav	7.98	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_010.wav	4.14	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_011.wav	8.11	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_012.wav	5.85	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_013.wav	5.38	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_014.wav	6.75	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_015.wav	6.40	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_016.wav	8.54	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_017.wav	4.48	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_018.wav	6.87	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_019.wav	8.41	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_020.wav	5.42	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_021.wav	10.84	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_022.wav	7.94	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_024.wav	9.60	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_025.wav	3.84	They might have asked, for goodness sake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_026.wav	3.41	He got very close tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_027.wav	3.93	Smoking is also very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_028.wav	5.72	Wages and salaries account for a major proportion of our expenses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_029.wav	3.67	The first appeared to be successful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_030.wav	3.55	We must convince the citizens.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_031.wav	3.63	Carlton also declined to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_032.wav	3.76	She is employed on short-term contracts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_033.wav	3.85	Further management changes are planned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_034.wav	3.97	Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_035.wav	3.71	It's as we were yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_036.wav	3.76	We are opening an inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_037.wav	3.20	He works at the airport.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_038.wav	3.16	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_039.wav	2.69	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_040.wav	3.12	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_041.wav	3.63	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_042.wav	2.56	What do we do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_043.wav	3.21	Why do it otherwise ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_044.wav	3.89	However, the purchase is as yet unproven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_045.wav	5.08	Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_046.wav	3.20	Something has to give sometime.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_047.wav	3.84	Her husband had been waiting for her return.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_048.wav	4.01	You must always attempt to raise the bar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_049.wav	3.37	The latter option was chosen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_050.wav	4.83	The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_051.wav	3.42	The man became a reporter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_052.wav	5.21	Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_053.wav	5.50	The thought of playing in the English Premiership has tremendous appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_054.wav	3.97	Among them are many criminals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_055.wav	3.80	I knew my contract was up this year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_056.wav	4.61	The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_057.wav	5.34	But it couldn't happen overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_058.wav	4.14	It was just too much for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_059.wav	2.86	Perhaps we should do the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_060.wav	4.01	They desperately want some stability.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_061.wav	3.63	Everything is possible in football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_062.wav	3.41	He looks like an Afghan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_063.wav	3.67	This trend is likely to strengthen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_064.wav	3.84	Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_065.wav	3.41	He will need that machine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_066.wav	4.06	Debate was impassioned and furious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_067.wav	2.73	I would not say that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_068.wav	4.48	This was a far cry from his election pledges.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_069.wav	3.88	Pulled a huge number of viewers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_070.wav	5.89	The regional newspapers have outperformed the national titles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_071.wav	5.33	A spokeswoman for the Law Society of Scotland said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_072.wav	4.10	We deserved the three points.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_073.wav	4.06	The wingers must have felt the cold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_074.wav	3.97	I am relishing the challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_075.wav	3.50	Let's hope that it does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_076.wav	4.36	But the organisers refused to worry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_077.wav	5.04	We have to keep our clients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_078.wav	3.50	We should be able to cope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_079.wav	4.40	He also had a Scottish grandfather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_080.wav	3.84	Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_081.wav	7.05	George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_082.wav	3.08	But I had never been in a theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_083.wav	5.12	He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_084.wav	4.23	Kenny Miller might come through.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_085.wav	4.40	Scottish football is finally on its way back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_086.wav	4.27	He's not getting into any games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_087.wav	3.33	We will pay their bills.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_088.wav	5.00	It is time for new ways for the church.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_089.wav	4.14	It was exactly four months away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_090.wav	3.88	I am glad I wasn't in it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_091.wav	4.74	THE Farmer wants a new campaign.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_092.wav	4.18	In fact, I have even had a bet on them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_093.wav	4.87	Final proposals will be published in February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_094.wav	4.23	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_095.wav	3.08	So, did she meet him ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_096.wav	3.97	So what is the campaign about ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_097.wav	2.30	And does it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_098.wav	3.12	Are you from the rugby ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_099.wav	2.35	Had I heard ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_100.wav	3.20	What happened in that game ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_101.wav	2.99	Are you going to win ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_102.wav	3.54	You should try to have a laugh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_103.wav	3.80	There can be no compromise on welfare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_104.wav	3.24	He will be kept informed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_105.wav	3.59	Maybe this battle has been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_106.wav	4.57	We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_107.wav	4.27	They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_108.wav	4.18	Wilson made his remarks on Tuesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_109.wav	5.33	Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_110.wav	3.89	Instead, another depression came in.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_111.wav	3.84	Even the one she loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_112.wav	3.58	We have thought about doing lots of things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_113.wav	5.25	England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_114.wav	3.12	Well, he is an artist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_115.wav	3.55	Everything else is a bonus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_116.wav	4.01	Harrowing is easy, after all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_117.wav	3.93	Those people must be accountable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_118.wav	3.80	If they liked it then I'll be happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_119.wav	5.38	They would be supported by visiting specialists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_120.wav	4.87	The ethos of the school was outstanding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_121.wav	2.65	Or so the story goes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_122.wav	4.70	Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_123.wav	4.01	Others may have, but I'm a fighter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_124.wav	3.71	We shall rely on human beings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_125.wav	4.31	McPherson came from United Biscuits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_126.wav	3.54	On Saturday, it was much the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_127.wav	4.36	The Breadwinner came home from Africa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_128.wav	3.84	Their season has been consigned to history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_129.wav	3.46	It wasn't possible to relax.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_130.wav	4.10	Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_131.wav	4.23	But then they scored their fourth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_132.wav	4.95	Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_133.wav	4.27	Monty is great in his own backyard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_134.wav	4.95	Brown also believes in Walker's innocence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_135.wav	5.59	That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_137.wav	3.84	All the employees are redundant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_138.wav	3.97	Absences should be carefully monitored.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_139.wav	4.61	He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_140.wav	4.95	The rise in retail sales was the first since August.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_141.wav	5.04	Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_142.wav	5.76	The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_143.wav	3.72	It wasn't about her singing, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_144.wav	3.38	He was forced to quit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_145.wav	3.67	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_146.wav	3.20	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_147.wav	3.03	how do you get it back ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_148.wav	5.59	I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_149.wav	5.72	Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was not breaking the Government's directions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_150.wav	4.53	I was given no instructions by no-one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_151.wav	4.65	The move follows a review of the Singapore
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_152.wav	3.71	We're not taking any risks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_153.wav	4.10	It's very dangerous for markets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_154.wav	3.80	That's what happened against Ayr.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_155.wav	5.17	Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_156.wav	3.97	The following are the principal provisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_157.wav	5.72	But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_158.wav	4.02	Before the game we went for a pint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_160.wav	5.12	We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_161.wav	4.35	Athletics is on a roll in the country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_162.wav	3.71	The milk industry is in turmoil.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_163.wav	5.68	He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_164.wav	3.37	And so the cycle continues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_165.wav	3.76	But the relief was short-lived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_166.wav	3.33	They exist in name alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_167.wav	3.12	YOU cannot blame the turnout.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_168.wav	4.10	We have reacted well to each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_169.wav	3.76	There were no plans for a rights issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_170.wav	3.33	I can see it now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_171.wav	7.09	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_172.wav	5.04	Do I think about them often ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_173.wav	3.88	Is it in the right place ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_174.wav	5.04	I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_175.wav	3.50	There's still plenty time left.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_176.wav	4.40	Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_177.wav	5.55	The upturn in the housing market has given a big boost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_178.wav	3.41	We are happy with the referee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_179.wav	4.99	Emergency services were also on stand-by outside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_180.wav	7.21	This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_181.wav	4.05	Pressure of work is no excuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_182.wav	5.98	Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_183.wav	3.97	The hearing was due to continue today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_184.wav	3.67	His job was not advertised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_185.wav	4.70	The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_186.wav	3.63	That was just one night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_187.wav	4.70	My father died in childbirth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_188.wav	3.89	They keep the atmosphere in mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_189.wav	4.52	Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_190.wav	3.76	Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_191.wav	4.35	That is an entirely unacceptable position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_192.wav	4.14	This is a frightening development.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_193.wav	3.84	In addition, margins have been maintained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_194.wav	3.84	Lee Westwood has other ideas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_195.wav	4.19	The Yugoslav army will still be there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_196.wav	4.19	Everyone around the club was supportive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_197.wav	3.33	You've got to be vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_198.wav	4.61	They have inherited the human rights abusers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_199.wav	4.74	This Patton will also return.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_200.wav	4.65	But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_201.wav	3.50	You are a gambling man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_202.wav	4.23	It is all to do with the coaching.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_203.wav	4.14	There was a fine line to tread.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_204.wav	4.14	The refund is fully justified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_205.wav	5.63	McCarthy said it would look at other means of tackling market abuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_206.wav	3.16	We believe a third party was involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_207.wav	4.10	I love the spectacle of cinema.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_208.wav	3.16	It would make a lot of sense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_209.wav	4.14	I think he's the favourite, no question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_210.wav	4.40	The partnership was set up during the summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_211.wav	4.10	Bottling is now the core business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_212.wav	4.61	People have been wonderful beyond belief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_213.wav	3.88	I enjoy the creative process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_214.wav	4.44	Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_215.wav	3.63	The whole thing was just unreal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_216.wav	5.08	The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_217.wav	4.61	However, this concern appears to be misguided.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_218.wav	4.66	That group reported just before Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_219.wav	3.24	We had to add value.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_220.wav	4.87	Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_221.wav	4.40	My players have no idea about football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_222.wav	7.21	Arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_223.wav	5.04	It opens the door to the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_224.wav	3.54	IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_225.wav	3.59	So I got a blood test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_226.wav	5.08	Stagecoach is seeking a new finance director.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_227.wav	4.82	He wants to be competing for titles and medals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_228.wav	3.80	There's always the next century.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_229.wav	4.27	For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_230.wav	5.08	That proved enough to settle the home side down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_231.wav	4.40	Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_232.wav	4.57	Years ago it was really quite simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_233.wav	4.53	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_234.wav	4.23	Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_235.wav	5.89	They've got some extremely good players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_236.wav	4.78	The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_237.wav	4.70	And they removed a Borderer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_238.wav	2.95	Does that put pressure on us ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_239.wav	2.09	Did it work ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_240.wav	3.84	Do you think we are a top nation ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_241.wav	3.55	It would seem a natural progression.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_242.wav	5.42	Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_243.wav	2.43	We will turn the corner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_244.wav	3.54	Of course, it is a tough assignment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_245.wav	3.72	There was no basis for their arrest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_246.wav	3.59	This wasn't just a big crowd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_247.wav	4.06	The best thing for me was to join the Army.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_248.wav	3.80	This is absolutely not true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_249.wav	4.06	This action reflects a slump in bookings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_250.wav	3.16	They should stop the bombing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_251.wav	3.12	These days are long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_252.wav	3.33	I've come here for the jersey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_253.wav	7.81	The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_254.wav	4.95	The strong performance is expected to continue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_255.wav	4.06	Their extinction is not inevitable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_256.wav	3.93	It's never great to finish second.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_257.wav	3.89	Bin Laden was not mentioned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_258.wav	4.36	Allen is strong in every shape and form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_259.wav	3.59	Her political persuasion is no secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_260.wav	3.59	We have a budget in March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_261.wav	3.71	The Dutchman was pleased with the result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_262.wav	2.99	You had to go and see him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_263.wav	4.36	The shoppers knew it before City investors did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_264.wav	4.48	The planning appears to have paid off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_265.wav	4.31	Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_266.wav	3.41	We believe in the medium term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_267.wav	4.14	Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_268.wav	5.25	They were never seen again by friends or relatives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_269.wav	3.03	They could not match it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_270.wav	4.83	In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_271.wav	4.57	A more exhaustive analysis is in progress.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_272.wav	3.67	I came up through the ranks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_273.wav	5.17	A warning may be sufficient to reform behaviour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_274.wav	3.63	Luckily, our patient was stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_275.wav	3.71	They made such decisions in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_276.wav	3.54	Clearly, they had other problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_277.wav	3.93	First, the programme was unbalanced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_278.wav	3.76	The happiness was slightly misplaced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_279.wav	3.46	Phase one was a shambles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_280.wav	4.44	If that's the case, he will struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_282.wav	4.10	A winter of discontent awaits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_283.wav	5.42	But no party would win overall control of Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_284.wav	4.31	Injuries have taken their toll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_285.wav	3.71	Says the Duke of York.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_286.wav	3.29	How independent is that ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_287.wav	5.08	What form did that take ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_288.wav	2.60	Are they free ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_289.wav	2.56	What are they for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_290.wav	3.03	Is there a waiting list ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_291.wav	4.65	When she went off it was quite amazing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_292.wav	4.19	Our destiny is in our own hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_293.wav	3.59	The Royal Highland was no exception.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_294.wav	6.79	Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_295.wav	5.51	She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_296.wav	2.90	They need to be involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_297.wav	3.72	We've had great things in the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_298.wav	3.80	It could be done by experts and lawyers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_299.wav	4.06	It has been recorded twice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_300.wav	3.63	Aberdeen had little to offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_301.wav	3.76	It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_302.wav	4.18	This youngster is so exciting!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_303.wav	4.01	I'm interested in interesting work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_304.wav	3.29	They will probably come back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_305.wav	6.53	Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_306.wav	3.08	It caused a lot of upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_307.wav	3.29	I saw them last week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_308.wav	3.54	Friday night was a pretty good night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_309.wav	4.78	This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_310.wav	6.02	You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_311.wav	5.89	In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_312.wav	3.76	Everyone can have their opinion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_313.wav	3.46	I was inspired by two things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_314.wav	3.07	It was a lovely sunset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_315.wav	4.01	Movie stars are public property.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_316.wav	4.53	It comes from reflection or thinking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_317.wav	4.87	Life has changed for rugby players in just three years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_318.wav	5.38	Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_319.wav	5.12	The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_320.wav	4.31	And we have the experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_321.wav	3.63	It gave me something to focus on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_322.wav	4.44	The result is utterly compelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_323.wav	4.44	The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_324.wav	3.20	It was his own decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_325.wav	3.72	You are a great player.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_326.wav	4.01	I won't make an official complaint.

VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_328.wav	5.85	It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_329.wav	4.78	It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_330.wav	3.63	Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_331.wav	3.84	We have an election in eight days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_332.wav	6.23	Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_333.wav	4.65	Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_334.wav	4.14	Walker plans to return indoors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_335.wav	6.02	It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_336.wav	3.67	The only problem was the greens.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_337.wav	5.08	HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_338.wav	5.51	The business has expanded rapidly, however.

VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_342.wav	5.42	Plans were made to expand.

VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_344.wav	2.43	Does it matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_345.wav	3.29	How do you take them away ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_346.wav	4.14	However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_347.wav	3.50	After the match, do you ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_348.wav	3.85	Have I really come to this ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_349.wav	4.95	Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_350.wav	3.72	I am considered a teenager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_351.wav	4.06	Anyway, the job will be part-time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_352.wav	4.27	And the World Cup has not even begun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_353.wav	3.29	Instead, he missed the lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_354.wav	4.14	Laura is an investment banker.

VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_359.wav	4.44	Being captain of this club is fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_360.wav	3.84	I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_361.wav	4.78	McCall is unlikely to change a winning team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_362.wav	4.78	The statement contained no surprises.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_363.wav	3.93	The performance continues to improve.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_364.wav	4.87	This would include the GM food industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_365.wav	3.72	There was an element of frustration.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_366.wav	4.57	We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_367.wav	4.70	Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_368.wav	4.10	Weather should not be a factor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_369.wav	4.31	It didn't matter who was in their way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_370.wav	3.46	He ended up a headmaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_371.wav	4.05	He looked at me before replying.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_372.wav	3.80	I have little time for analysts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_373.wav	4.49	I have huge respect for him as a journalist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_374.wav	3.97	That remains the unanswered question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_375.wav	3.84	He added, We are not prepared for war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_376.wav	4.14	My wife and family are the support system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_377.wav	5.42	David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_378.wav	4.53	The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.

VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_380.wav	3.93	Those overseas offices were great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_381.wav	5.38	Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_382.wav	4.87	Six games without defeat is the legacy so far.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_383.wav	3.76	Three weeks later, he resigned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_384.wav	4.40	Labour will almost certainly remain in control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_385.wav	4.53	Venus rejects the very suggestion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_386.wav	4.10	We were beaten by the better team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_387.wav	3.50	I have received no explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_388.wav	7.39	Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_389.wav	4.69	He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_390.wav	2.73	And it had two seats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_391.wav	3.50	This is a load of nonsense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_392.wav	4.01	Potions said he would drive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_393.wav	5.38	Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.

VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_395.wav	4.31	It is sending the wrong message to people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_396.wav	4.87	Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_397.wav	4.19	You can feel at home in China.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_398.wav	5.29	The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_399.wav	3.67	It seems to have worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_400.wav	4.22	We have no information on Iraq.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_401.wav	5.12	Either way, the investor retains the premium.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_402.wav	4.91	There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_403.wav	4.61	We're looking for unity in the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_404.wav	4.91	Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_405.wav	4.49	The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_406.wav	3.97	Washington is consumed by the crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_407.wav	4.18	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_408.wav	2.95	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_409.wav	4.74	It makes no difference to their friendship.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_410.wav	6.02	It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p268\p268_411.wav	4.87	The capital costs are modest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_001.wav	2.26	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_002.wav	3.88	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_003.wav	6.53	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_004.wav	4.87	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_005.wav	5.81	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_006.wav	5.55	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_007.wav	4.31	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_008.wav	7.26	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_009.wav	4.99	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_010.wav	3.24	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_011.wav	6.57	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_012.wav	4.95	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_013.wav	4.27	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_014.wav	5.25	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_015.wav	6.02	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_016.wav	6.23	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_017.wav	4.10	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_018.wav	5.59	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_019.wav	6.62	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_020.wav	4.27	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_021.wav	8.11	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_022.wav	6.40	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of the number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_023.wav	10.93	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_024.wav	7.64	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_025.wav	4.57	She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_026.wav	1.62	But it failed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_027.wav	3.54	He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_028.wav	3.42	In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_029.wav	4.53	Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_030.wav	1.84	I have a theory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_031.wav	1.92	Is this accurate?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_032.wav	2.65	Because we do not need it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_033.wav	2.91	He took me on a tour of the wards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_034.wav	4.49	Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_035.wav	2.05	Help is needed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_036.wav	3.12	A web site is planned for November.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_037.wav	3.80	It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_038.wav	4.10	Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_039.wav	1.88	That's no bad thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_040.wav	5.17	Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_041.wav	3.16	She is believed to be in South Africa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_042.wav	2.01	I was scared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_043.wav	1.84	It was ugly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_044.wav	3.67	There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_045.wav	3.16	Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_046.wav	3.84	We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_047.wav	2.05	Who can say?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_048.wav	2.26	He had no enemies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_049.wav	3.46	Her body was found about four miles from the car.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_050.wav	2.86	I was inspired by two things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_051.wav	4.23	Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_052.wav	1.92	It's very odd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_053.wav	2.52	We have not given up hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_054.wav	4.40	This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_055.wav	4.01	New York is expected to come to a standstill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_056.wav	2.90	We are a grandmother.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_057.wav	2.99	None has ever been found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_058.wav	2.65	You do not change overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_059.wav	2.22	Art is extra.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_060.wav	2.27	They're appalled by that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_061.wav	2.39	There was a battle there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_062.wav	2.99	Scotland had great assets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_063.wav	2.69	It's that kind of place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_064.wav	2.01	They are real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_065.wav	2.90	I've spent a lot of time on buses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_066.wav	5.38	Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_067.wav	3.93	We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_068.wav	2.22	You need a trademark.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_069.wav	3.07	Painful, but only because it's true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_070.wav	3.16	I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_071.wav	1.46	It's a winner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_072.wav	2.48	There could be a way back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_073.wav	2.48	I was as strong as a horse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_074.wav	3.33	Both sides have been hit by injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_075.wav	2.90	The girls are so lucky to be alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_076.wav	3.50	It is a job creation scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_077.wav	4.02	There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_078.wav	2.86	He is now resident in England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_079.wav	3.03	Even the one she loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_080.wav	2.48	People must remain vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_081.wav	2.78	This is the way things should be handled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_082.wav	3.67	It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_083.wav	2.86	I'd like to continue that record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_084.wav	2.44	That is bound to happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_085.wav	4.31	That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_086.wav	2.35	All options are open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_087.wav	2.39	Someone who cares
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_088.wav	3.37	By then, he was walking on water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_089.wav	1.88	You will be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_090.wav	3.67	He put some colour into Scottish history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_091.wav	4.06	We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_092.wav	4.57	The name on the passport and other details have not been disclosed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_093.wav	2.65	Today I couldn't run on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_094.wav	2.48	They've got to account for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_096.wav	3.76	Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_097.wav	5.21	Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_098.wav	4.65	An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_099.wav	5.42	However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_100.wav	3.33	May not have been at fault?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_101.wav	2.90	We want to get to the final, anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_102.wav	2.99	Oil embargo endorsed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_103.wav	3.67	But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_104.wav	4.52	No date has been set for the appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_105.wav	2.31	It's not perfect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_106.wav	4.18	While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_107.wav	2.86	He pleaded for caution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_108.wav	2.44	It was quite rigorous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_109.wav	3.16	I was fighting for my life, I thought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_110.wav	3.16	I can't even get into the A team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_111.wav	3.25	The picture is the same across Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_112.wav	2.35	It was the eighties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_113.wav	4.70	We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_114.wav	3.89	It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_115.wav	2.56	Maybe this battle has been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_116.wav	2.48	My office is bare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_117.wav	4.06	Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_118.wav	4.91	This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_119.wav	2.39	It was a delight on every level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_121.wav	4.57	We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_122.wav	2.27	She has been shot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_123.wav	2.86	I thought it was a fantastic game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_124.wav	3.46	Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_125.wav	3.67	I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_126.wav	4.05	His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_127.wav	4.18	Next season for every manager is a long time away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_128.wav	3.80	It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_129.wav	3.76	It's terrible that he has died the same way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_130.wav	3.93	So the European elections are extremely important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_131.wav	3.33	Offered the gold medal, he declined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_132.wav	2.05	Who will attend?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_133.wav	3.67	Twaddle is a case in point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_134.wav	3.37	We had a reunion last week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_135.wav	4.22	The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_136.wav	3.59	The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_137.wav	2.01	It's the big omission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_138.wav	3.24	If not, a deal could take many months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_139.wav	2.22	What will happen then?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_140.wav	4.65	Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_141.wav	4.06	We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_142.wav	2.35	It's a question of fashion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_143.wav	3.80	He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_144.wav	3.58	It seems so long since I did the exams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_145.wav	3.63	And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_146.wav	2.99	Wallace was a prisoner of war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_147.wav	4.10	We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_148.wav	2.01	He is severe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_149.wav	2.22	We just had a go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_150.wav	2.14	She died at her home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_151.wav	3.29	We have seen a copy of the report.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_152.wav	4.31	They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_153.wav	4.14	That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_154.wav	3.03	It's like a football team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_155.wav	3.20	It would be a last resort.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_156.wav	4.10	That group reported just before Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_157.wav	3.59	He will emerge as a world leader.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_158.wav	4.01	The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_159.wav	3.20	I was so nervous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_160.wav	3.46	We want to see the maximum of change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_161.wav	4.06	Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_162.wav	2.82	His death was a tragic accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_163.wav	3.20	This latter point is hugely important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_164.wav	2.09	It is so unfair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_165.wav	2.82	It is an attitude of mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_166.wav	3.20	I've put my own money into this project.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_167.wav	4.40	They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_168.wav	2.31	I am now unemployed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_169.wav	4.10	Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_170.wav	2.65	We have to move forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_171.wav	2.99	We knew we had the goal we wanted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_172.wav	2.01	I lost my head.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_173.wav	4.53	Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_174.wav	3.89	Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_175.wav	4.10	Waiting times for these services are too long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_176.wav	2.86	They thought they had found a home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_177.wav	3.63	His team management was protective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_179.wav	3.80	But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_180.wav	3.24	It was a great achievement to win at Wembley.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_181.wav	4.18	It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_182.wav	3.97	I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_183.wav	2.39	Everyone can be bought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_184.wav	5.29	The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_185.wav	3.12	They know no other way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_186.wav	1.75	It's an idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_187.wav	2.48	They will run a mile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_188.wav	2.90	Four policemen were wounded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_189.wav	2.73	We did everything by the book.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_190.wav	2.01	Does this matter?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_191.wav	4.57	My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_193.wav	3.54	It had been in place since last July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_194.wav	4.14	I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_195.wav	3.71	Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_196.wav	2.48	We must keep our feet on the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_197.wav	3.97	Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_198.wav	3.29	The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_199.wav	2.91	The conference is the first test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_200.wav	2.65	We played them off the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_201.wav	4.23	He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_202.wav	3.88	On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_203.wav	1.88	It was good fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_204.wav	4.44	The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_205.wav	2.99	It's all about money, money, money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_206.wav	4.61	Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_207.wav	4.18	I had been at the Evening Standard for two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_208.wav	4.01	After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_209.wav	2.69	But I am a worried man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_210.wav	3.67	This gives a financial incentive to switch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_211.wav	2.27	Saddam Hussein is a devil.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_212.wav	1.88	Feel the heat?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_213.wav	2.95	HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_214.wav	5.29	We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_215.wav	2.44	I began to pray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_216.wav	2.82	I am delighted for Simon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_217.wav	2.69	It had all been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_218.wav	3.54	A Grampian Police spokesman said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_219.wav	4.44	I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_220.wav	3.16	The attacker has been put in foster care.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_221.wav	4.48	For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_222.wav	4.70	The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_223.wav	3.07	The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_224.wav	2.05	Who was on the panel?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_225.wav	3.84	Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_226.wav	1.75	It's so special.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_227.wav	4.23	The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_228.wav	4.95	Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_229.wav	2.47	I have spoken to the skipper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_230.wav	3.12	I'd never seen a play about me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_231.wav	4.27	It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_232.wav	2.86	My neighbours are horrified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_233.wav	1.92	But she was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_234.wav	2.44	It's like a basketball.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_235.wav	3.71	And thought we would get away with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_236.wav	3.25	Of course, that is not the whole story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_237.wav	4.01	Half of young people had had contact with the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_238.wav	2.69	Well, they were the unlucky ones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_239.wav	3.88	The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_240.wav	1.88	It's quite nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_241.wav	4.01	On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_242.wav	4.14	A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_243.wav	3.93	It would still have been a good film, but very different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_244.wav	3.08	In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_245.wav	5.00	It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_246.wav	3.33	I know I'm in a very special position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_247.wav	3.20	You can feel at home in China.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_248.wav	3.67	Some families have even requested to leave the city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_249.wav	3.80	The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_250.wav	3.33	It's a record label, not a form of music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_251.wav	1.84	I was shocked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_252.wav	2.39	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_253.wav	4.06	We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_254.wav	3.37	Her presence was almost everywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_255.wav	2.31	I can't get a job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_256.wav	2.18	It is nearly there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_257.wav	2.39	Special measures were needed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_258.wav	5.04	For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_259.wav	3.33	The distinction is also supported by doctors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_260.wav	3.97	It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_261.wav	2.61	Kirkwood was arrested.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_263.wav	2.31	I am very angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_264.wav	2.90	It is also very valuable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_265.wav	3.80	This court has made an order which has not been observed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_266.wav	4.31	The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_267.wav	2.86	The warning is timely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_268.wav	5.04	Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_269.wav	3.37	They want to shut the Scottish Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_270.wav	2.60	They are never here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_271.wav	4.22	The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_272.wav	3.50	On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_273.wav	2.82	It left me with a sadness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_274.wav	3.84	Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_275.wav	4.40	We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_276.wav	3.12	But, in fact, the reverse is true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_277.wav	2.90	They wanted the club to make money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_278.wav	2.09	It's a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_279.wav	4.40	The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_280.wav	3.89	A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_281.wav	4.10	He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_282.wav	4.10	However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_283.wav	3.55	In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_284.wav	3.97	In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_285.wav	3.08	It happens from time to time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_286.wav	2.43	If not, he should go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_287.wav	2.82	They were too hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_288.wav	2.57	I saw it at a ruck.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_289.wav	3.37	I intended to look for another club on loan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_290.wav	2.90	You've got to have both sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_291.wav	4.44	What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_292.wav	2.14	It was a virus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_293.wav	2.14	Who will perform?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_294.wav	3.25	It's like a high school play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_295.wav	2.69	This is a national crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_296.wav	3.46	I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_297.wav	3.46	The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_298.wav	4.91	Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_299.wav	3.08	It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_300.wav	2.09	It changed my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_301.wav	3.25	It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_302.wav	3.38	Sunday's game was not a trial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_303.wav	4.61	If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_304.wav	3.25	A new school will be built.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_305.wav	5.08	I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_306.wav	4.70	Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_307.wav	2.35	I was the sheep.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_308.wav	3.29	Graeme was prepared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_309.wav	4.36	However, the snow was welcomed by some.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_310.wav	3.37	But it's a subtle process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_311.wav	4.36	The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_312.wav	3.46	There is no openness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_313.wav	1.84	They are wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_314.wav	4.14	Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_315.wav	4.05	Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_316.wav	3.97	In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_317.wav	2.86	It's just not funny!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_318.wav	3.93	It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_319.wav	3.72	They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_320.wav	4.86	The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_321.wav	3.12	SCOTLAND has shown the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_322.wav	2.27	I did not name it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_323.wav	4.74	The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_324.wav	3.37	We have got no money to go anywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_325.wav	3.16	This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_326.wav	4.14	It's about my time as a guitarist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_327.wav	1.88	I was rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_328.wav	3.08	We are a peaceful people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_329.wav	4.23	The election is total confusion and chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_330.wav	1.92	Kids are terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_331.wav	3.20	Henman has been warned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_332.wav	4.35	Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_333.wav	3.25	The problems began a long time ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_334.wav	3.24	Referees are easy targets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_335.wav	2.48	They had a confession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_336.wav	4.05	In the old days, it was easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_337.wav	4.06	However, the groups denied the claims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_338.wav	3.33	I came into this world with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_339.wav	2.86	That's the law of the land.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_340.wav	3.03	There was no time scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_341.wav	2.52	It is a strong case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_342.wav	2.94	Is there a new way forward?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_343.wav	4.40	They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_344.wav	2.65	The boat was fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_345.wav	3.71	I'd like to take the plunge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_346.wav	4.10	Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_347.wav	3.46	You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_348.wav	2.39	It's been hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_349.wav	3.76	Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_350.wav	2.39	It is a sign of hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_352.wav	3.03	It has moved on in the last week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_353.wav	3.54	That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_354.wav	2.61	You feel the pride.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_355.wav	2.01	The train was on time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_356.wav	3.37	It was so new, so exciting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_357.wav	4.27	Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_358.wav	2.91	A great deal has been achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_359.wav	2.95	It was forced to divert.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_360.wav	2.26	It should be scrapped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_361.wav	2.61	It is long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_362.wav	1.92	I HAVE a dream.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_363.wav	2.74	Tyson is overwhelmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_364.wav	3.16	As, indeed, they would be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_365.wav	4.02	But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_366.wav	3.42	It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_367.wav	4.40	Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_368.wav	2.39	We will be homeless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_369.wav	3.42	I expected these kind of questions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_370.wav	4.95	Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_371.wav	4.53	It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_372.wav	2.18	It's a true story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_373.wav	3.97	All the investment is possible through the public sector.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_374.wav	3.67	He later became a respected High Court judge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_375.wav	3.54	The play is based on a real-life event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_376.wav	3.07	He could face a jail sentence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_377.wav	4.57	The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_378.wav	3.72	They have not done so this season so far.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_379.wav	5.08	I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_380.wav	2.82	They play together perfectly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_381.wav	2.39	It is a large number.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_382.wav	4.06	He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_383.wav	2.95	They haven't got a hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_384.wav	4.70	It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_385.wav	2.35	He denied the charge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_386.wav	2.14	You can cope with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_387.wav	3.08	I am very happy with life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_388.wav	3.46	A young Briton had a lucky escape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_389.wav	3.42	Treatment is not an issue with these people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_391.wav	3.33	If you look at the other galleries in this area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_392.wav	2.69	In Scotland, we keep the faith.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_393.wav	3.97	On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_394.wav	3.37	I'm pleased about one thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_395.wav	2.14	It is unusual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_396.wav	3.67	We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_397.wav	2.27	I suspect the latter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_398.wav	4.23	Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_399.wav	4.40	Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_400.wav	4.53	By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_401.wav	2.82	My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_402.wav	2.61	The car was just there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p269\p269_403.wav	4.57	The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_001.wav	2.43	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_002.wav	4.74	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_003.wav	8.62	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_004.wav	6.06	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_005.wav	7.64	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_006.wav	6.57	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_007.wav	5.00	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_008.wav	8.41	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_009.wav	5.42	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_010.wav	3.25	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_011.wav	8.96	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_012.wav	5.04	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_013.wav	5.17	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_014.wav	5.29	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_015.wav	6.11	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_016.wav	7.51	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_017.wav	4.53	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_018.wav	6.23	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_019.wav	7.64	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_020.wav	4.74	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_021.wav	9.69	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_022.wav	7.47	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_023.wav	13.19	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_024.wav	12.63	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_025.wav	4.10	He was afraid to stay in hospital in Kosovo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_026.wav	2.61	They will not be allowed to succeed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_027.wav	3.07	Smoking is also very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_028.wav	2.86	Allan Johnston was not match fit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_029.wav	3.07	It was as if I had been stabbed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_030.wav	3.12	He has the courage of the unaware.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_031.wav	3.41	Drugs are a serious problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_032.wav	3.29	We have to find a way to put that right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_033.wav	2.73	That is the face of fear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_034.wav	4.91	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_035.wav	2.90	Costs have got to be controlled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_036.wav	2.22	He really is a lovely man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_037.wav	3.80	There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_038.wav	3.71	The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_039.wav	2.91	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_040.wav	2.65	The boy is no longer with us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_041.wav	2.65	Among them are many criminals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_042.wav	2.73	Merger would be entirely logical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_043.wav	3.54	Must be prepared to use it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_044.wav	2.69	Not if you know the person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_045.wav	3.67	That was the theory, anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_046.wav	3.12	I had come back from London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_047.wav	2.77	I had trouble with the producers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_048.wav	4.61	Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_049.wav	3.20	My fitness was very poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_050.wav	3.37	He also presented You Bet!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_051.wav	2.56	What do they want us to do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_052.wav	2.18	Is it worth it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_053.wav	2.01	Does it matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_054.wav	2.99	How do you take them away ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_055.wav	4.10	However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_056.wav	3.08	After the match, do you ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_057.wav	2.69	Because we do not need it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_058.wav	3.97	The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_059.wav	3.25	The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_060.wav	2.65	We have not given up hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_061.wav	4.14	In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_062.wav	3.37	We have made a commitment to those people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_063.wav	2.74	Have a look at our accounts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_064.wav	3.71	Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_065.wav	4.14	Final proposals will be published in February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_066.wav	4.14	Robin Williams is very subdued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_067.wav	2.86	It wasn't possible to relax.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_068.wav	3.88	Then followed a bout of flu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_069.wav	3.58	Both sides have been hit by injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_070.wav	5.21	Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_071.wav	4.65	Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_072.wav	5.34	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_073.wav	3.85	She declined to give the reasons for the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_074.wav	2.73	It is not in my nature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_075.wav	3.20	My immune system had been depleted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_076.wav	2.95	It was a unanimous decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_077.wav	3.25	It makes for an interesting conference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_078.wav	2.99	I've had it for the exams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_079.wav	3.03	I first met him last summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_080.wav	3.84	The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_081.wav	3.11	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_082.wav	4.36	Potions said he would drive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_083.wav	4.78	The city council is a major property owner in the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_084.wav	3.20	Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_085.wav	3.80	Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_086.wav	5.33	The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_087.wav	4.27	The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_088.wav	2.73	The peace process will be buried!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_089.wav	2.43	They must be on commission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_090.wav	4.35	He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_091.wav	4.99	Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_092.wav	3.16	We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_093.wav	3.42	The move follows a review of the Singapore
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_094.wav	5.55	However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_095.wav	3.97	We should recognise that others have done a good job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_096.wav	4.87	It was some time before she found out he was safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_097.wav	3.11	But the battle has only just begun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_098.wav	2.90	In the end we made too many errors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_099.wav	3.03	That time is not now, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_100.wav	3.59	The following are the principal provisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_101.wav	4.78	But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_102.wav	3.42	The new system will be marketed this summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_103.wav	4.05	We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_104.wav	3.63	I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_105.wav	3.12	I understand the medical concerns.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_106.wav	3.89	The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_107.wav	3.97	Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_108.wav	3.25	We deserve a significant rise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_109.wav	2.90	I would be prepared to go anywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_110.wav	2.39	You had better believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_111.wav	3.16	The website has changed the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_112.wav	2.31	This is a step backwards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_113.wav	4.74	IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_114.wav	3.84	The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_115.wav	4.19	Its replacement was not used in the exercise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_116.wav	2.69	The problem was a social problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_117.wav	3.29	Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_118.wav	2.90	You were made to feel so welcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_119.wav	3.12	You must always attempt to raise the bar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_120.wav	2.43	You can spend money on housing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_121.wav	2.18	It's not a quick fix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_122.wav	2.90	That admission is not surprising.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_123.wav	2.86	Those people must be accountable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_124.wav	2.86	I've never seen a game like it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_125.wav	3.54	They keep the atmosphere in mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_126.wav	3.42	But we could only help a handful of people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_127.wav	3.97	Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_128.wav	2.82	Becoming a father was wonderful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_129.wav	1.88	I was on a roll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_130.wav	1.63	Are they free ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_131.wav	1.88	What are they for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_132.wav	2.14	Is there a waiting list ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_133.wav	2.74	Do they think anyone else wants them ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_134.wav	2.22	So what happens next ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_135.wav	3.20	The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_136.wav	3.93	But beyond a fairly minimal level it has little impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_137.wav	2.18	The first half was depressing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_138.wav	3.29	They made such decisions in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_139.wav	3.03	Italy was just behind the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_140.wav	3.12	The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_141.wav	2.56	I feel very grateful with everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_142.wav	2.31	There was an element of frustration.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_143.wav	1.92	Before it was an ordeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_144.wav	2.69	I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_145.wav	3.20	Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_146.wav	3.03	Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_147.wav	3.84	Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_148.wav	4.87	No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_149.wav	2.69	We will provide immediate access.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_150.wav	2.65	I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_151.wav	3.76	It is not disputed that the driver was at fault.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_152.wav	4.27	The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_153.wav	2.35	They have not been named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_154.wav	2.44	The transaction is not feasible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_155.wav	2.69	It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_156.wav	2.22	We will turn the corner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_157.wav	2.18	My Dad is a hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_158.wav	3.03	Do you think we are a top nation ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_159.wav	2.22	Is our children learning ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_160.wav	2.18	How independent is that ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_161.wav	2.14	What form did that take ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_162.wav	2.95	They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_163.wav	4.05	There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_164.wav	2.22	The woman was his wife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_165.wav	3.03	This action reflects a slump in bookings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_166.wav	3.29	Scotland came very close in the second Test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_167.wav	2.61	We did what we had to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_168.wav	3.08	The strong performance is expected to continue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_169.wav	2.95	She returned to the theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_170.wav	2.35	It's nice to be involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_171.wav	2.69	That would open the gates of hell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_172.wav	3.54	Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_173.wav	2.44	Nobody did in those days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_174.wav	2.61	There is no signature on this document.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_175.wav	3.42	I would be very keen on a move to Italy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_176.wav	1.92	They could not match it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_177.wav	3.16	His team management was protective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_178.wav	2.14	The jury is still out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_179.wav	2.86	The outcome is now in our own hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_180.wav	2.82	City sentiment is in his favour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_181.wav	3.67	I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_182.wav	2.82	I'm pretty happy with the way I played.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_183.wav	2.90	Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_184.wav	4.40	For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_185.wav	3.29	It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_186.wav	3.59	They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_187.wav	3.50	They receive a high profile in the media.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_188.wav	2.61	That's not fair to the supporters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_189.wav	2.99	They bought the property four years ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_190.wav	2.56	They need to look after themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_191.wav	2.94	Miller was every bit as happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_192.wav	2.14	You know the sort of thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_193.wav	2.90	They were seriously after him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_194.wav	4.23	Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_195.wav	2.69	We represent a wide range of society.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_196.wav	3.03	Motorists will buy passes in advance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_197.wav	2.48	It's very difficult to find a buyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_198.wav	3.12	I know every village and island on the west coast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_199.wav	2.22	Mr Blair was ready for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_200.wav	2.73	He should emerge as the winner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_201.wav	2.39	In France, the reverse is true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_202.wav	2.31	I came home by ambulance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_203.wav	2.82	It comes from reflection or thinking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_204.wav	2.61	They have the cash and the fire power.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_205.wav	2.86	We believe a third party was involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_206.wav	2.95	The early physical reports were clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_207.wav	4.27	The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_208.wav	4.44	Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_209.wav	2.65	The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_210.wav	3.37	This decision will prove to be the opposite of a standstill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_211.wav	2.73	I am very realistic about these things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_212.wav	4.82	British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_213.wav	2.43	They are looking at a flotation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_214.wav	3.07	There can be no compromise on that demand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_215.wav	3.54	Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_216.wav	3.12	It would appear to be a good time to invest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_217.wav	2.86	HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_218.wav	2.82	From there, they can go anywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_219.wav	2.90	There is no excuse for domestic abuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_220.wav	2.69	It had all been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_221.wav	2.73	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_222.wav	2.56	Do I think about them often ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_223.wav	2.43	Is it in the right place ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_224.wav	1.54	Did he trip ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_225.wav	2.35	Does that put pressure on us ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_226.wav	2.73	It was finally agreed on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_227.wav	3.71	Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_228.wav	3.12	They are difficult awards to decide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_229.wav	2.27	I am considered a teenager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_230.wav	3.07	There's a chance they might come down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_231.wav	2.47	Yet the evidence is plain to see.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_232.wav	4.18	There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_233.wav	3.41	I wouldn't even respond to that question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_234.wav	2.82	People should make their own decisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_235.wav	5.16	Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_236.wav	4.57	They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_237.wav	2.35	That was a real challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_238.wav	4.01	His background is firmly in venture capital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_239.wav	3.80	The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_240.wav	2.73	We were a shambles at the back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_241.wav	2.69	The scientific debate is dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_242.wav	2.73	They are the innocent victims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_243.wav	3.93	You should always be able to get out in some direction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_244.wav	3.24	Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_245.wav	2.99	This would include the GM food industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_246.wav	1.84	And he goes with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_247.wav	2.52	It had so much to do with output.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_248.wav	3.97	Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_249.wav	2.90	That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_250.wav	1.96	The irony was not lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_251.wav	2.99	I might get an injury very easily.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_252.wav	2.65	It might be sad, but it's a fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_253.wav	2.78	Everything depends on the weather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_254.wav	2.22	This is a historic occasion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_255.wav	3.50	This championship is different from the other majors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_256.wav	2.82	Labour was too busy to respond.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_257.wav	3.03	I was just getting over the time difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_258.wav	3.24	I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_259.wav	3.46	Either way, the investor retains the premium.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_260.wav	3.63	There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_261.wav	2.69	You're not getting any goodwill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_262.wav	3.03	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_263.wav	3.59	No production contract is yet in sight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_264.wav	3.37	Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_265.wav	4.18	A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_266.wav	1.92	We accept the new rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_267.wav	2.18	It is probably in the culture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_268.wav	2.31	He took over our lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_269.wav	2.09	I'd never run for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_270.wav	1.92	how do you get it back ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_271.wav	2.22	What are you not good at ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_272.wav	1.84	I think, therefore I am ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_273.wav	2.09	Who was she ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_274.wav	1.75	Or was it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_275.wav	2.48	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_276.wav	2.65	These figures are truly terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_277.wav	3.37	The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_278.wav	2.74	He could see no other bidder.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_279.wav	2.69	There's not much money in cycling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_280.wav	2.56	None of this work is guaranteed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_281.wav	2.95	This could put pressure on UK inflation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_282.wav	2.95	Any error is severely punished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_283.wav	3.76	Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_284.wav	2.56	I understand the security issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_285.wav	2.65	It left me with a sadness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_286.wav	3.50	Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_287.wav	3.37	The target is to break even by Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_288.wav	2.56	It was never a free kick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_289.wav	3.67	The manager's position was obviously included in that review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_290.wav	2.39	It involved the same people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_291.wav	2.74	She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_292.wav	3.12	You have to expect this type of thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_293.wav	2.39	There's always the next century.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_294.wav	2.09	It's hard to see it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_295.wav	2.91	The partnership was set up during the summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_296.wav	3.54	Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_297.wav	4.02	There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_298.wav	3.16	I intended to look for another club on loan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_299.wav	2.56	Maloney is an engaging talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_300.wav	3.80	We would hope to make progress on that next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_301.wav	2.82	The rescue package is public money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_302.wav	2.78	He was overwhelmed by the response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_303.wav	2.57	The effect was almost magical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_304.wav	3.03	It would be great to win the title again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_305.wav	2.22	It could well be military.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_306.wav	2.95	Selection is not in my hands at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_307.wav	4.14	His day had started much like any other Sunday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_308.wav	2.73	The songs are just so good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_309.wav	2.61	Sunday's game was not a trial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_310.wav	3.46	Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_311.wav	2.65	The world record is suspicious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_312.wav	2.44	There was no hint of scandal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_313.wav	2.73	I was brought up in a mining background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_314.wav	2.39	Job losses were also announced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_315.wav	4.95	A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_316.wav	2.39	It is a road of death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_317.wav	2.01	The pound has also suffered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_318.wav	2.13	He has left the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_319.wav	2.18	What happened in that game ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_320.wav	1.92	Are you going to win ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_321.wav	1.88	Was it the wife ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_322.wav	1.58	Why change it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_323.wav	2.18	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_324.wav	1.79	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_325.wav	2.65	People can really get themselves in a mess.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_326.wav	2.78	Survival is not an option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_327.wav	2.91	There will be good prospects ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_328.wav	4.48	Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_329.wav	4.02	It is a court case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_330.wav	2.52	This isn't the end of story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_331.wav	2.18	It will set the tone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_332.wav	1.97	He will go a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_333.wav	1.84	It is far too early.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_334.wav	4.05	The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_335.wav	2.94	The Premier League has been a huge success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_336.wav	3.12	Age is not like other forms of discrimination.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_337.wav	2.52	The next week is crucial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_338.wav	4.57	Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_339.wav	3.08	My body is clearly capable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_340.wav	4.61	It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_341.wav	2.35	There was some merit in that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_342.wav	2.65	They were impressive against France.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_343.wav	3.33	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_344.wav	2.14	So, did she meet him ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_345.wav	2.69	So what is the campaign about ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_346.wav	1.84	And does it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_347.wav	2.26	Are you from the rugby ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_348.wav	3.76	He declined to comment on possible disposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_349.wav	2.44	Nobody said it was required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_350.wav	2.86	This statement has never been withdrawn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_351.wav	2.65	It was tough to contain the excitement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_352.wav	2.73	Whether this return was too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_353.wav	3.72	Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_354.wav	2.91	There is a good example in this city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_355.wav	1.97	It's wonderful to have won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_356.wav	2.22	He was at school in Devon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_357.wav	2.13	This decision is a farce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_358.wav	3.50	My view has now completely changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_359.wav	3.07	Finally, he paid for the movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_360.wav	2.91	We are satisfied with this outcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_361.wav	2.95	We have very limited capacity.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_362.wav	3.33	Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_363.wav	2.69	An alternative must be offered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_364.wav	3.03	The value of the merger is still there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_365.wav	2.18	Nobody else was with me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_366.wav	3.03	My mind is focused on the next four weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_367.wav	3.71	We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_368.wav	2.56	But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_369.wav	2.35	He was then replaced by Ross.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_370.wav	3.33	But BA said the prediction was premature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_371.wav	2.44	You need a licence to run a pub.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_372.wav	4.18	The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_373.wav	2.39	I came here this week to work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_374.wav	2.61	They knew that I wanted to do something.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_375.wav	3.59	Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_376.wav	2.26	He must have seen the movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_377.wav	3.67	This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_378.wav	2.82	She said they would appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_379.wav	2.56	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_380.wav	1.84	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_381.wav	2.52	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_382.wav	2.05	What do we do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_383.wav	3.07	They were to blame for the first two goals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_384.wav	3.38	Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_385.wav	3.12	Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_386.wav	2.82	She is obviously very disappointed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_387.wav	3.71	In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_388.wav	2.99	Last season was very hard for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_389.wav	4.53	The parties include the Scottish Executive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_390.wav	3.20	Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_391.wav	4.44	Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_392.wav	5.55	I always knew she was funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_393.wav	3.55	Glasgow University declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_394.wav	3.33	It runs until the beginning of June.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_395.wav	2.30	It sounds like a wish list.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_396.wav	2.39	They have not got anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_397.wav	3.08	It has happened for generations.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_398.wav	2.90	There was a substantial explosion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_399.wav	2.65	Petrol prices were widely blamed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_400.wav	4.65	The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_401.wav	2.69	I was conceived in Aberdeen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_402.wav	4.74	Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_403.wav	2.82	There's still no-one like him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_404.wav	3.29	He put some colour into Scottish history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_405.wav	2.39	Ferguson must take the blame.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_406.wav	2.05	It's too close to call.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_407.wav	2.86	The breakdown was much later in her life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_408.wav	3.33	Of course, it is nonsense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_409.wav	2.86	Colour was at the core of his life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_410.wav	3.33	We must improve our relations with government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_411.wav	2.35	That is the ultimate revenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_412.wav	5.42	In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_413.wav	3.50	A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_414.wav	3.63	Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_415.wav	3.03	Shelter also supports the reform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_416.wav	4.01	This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_417.wav	2.22	That was a touch of class.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_418.wav	2.35	People will see this over time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_419.wav	3.37	Surrey police said no body had been found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_420.wav	3.84	The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_421.wav	2.44	My aim is a top six finish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_422.wav	2.48	Such an attack is bizarre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_423.wav	3.84	If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_424.wav	2.99	This is a huge boost for my confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_425.wav	2.31	It was a breathtaking moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_426.wav	2.27	It needs to be volatile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_427.wav	4.69	The need for any new UN resolutions will be put on hold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_428.wav	2.82	The woman is basically off her head.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_429.wav	3.93	I never won a penny throughout my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_430.wav	3.41	Thomson is expected to manage the business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_431.wav	3.63	The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_432.wav	2.52	In fact, the reasons are simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_433.wav	2.74	We know about the crisis in cattle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_434.wav	2.65	The British government does not want to know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_435.wav	2.86	It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_436.wav	2.05	I didn't get to keep it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_437.wav	3.63	Their condition is described as satisfactory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_438.wav	2.14	It would be very dangerous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_439.wav	4.23	Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_440.wav	3.33	The villagers were shot in the head at short range.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_441.wav	2.69	It is not over by any means.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_442.wav	1.92	It deserved to be a winner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_443.wav	2.90	They are interior designers and architects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_444.wav	3.03	It shows the right amount of progress.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_445.wav	2.35	I think the goalkeeper should have gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_446.wav	3.12	They had learned from the lessons of the first game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_447.wav	2.13	It was to be inclusive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_448.wav	3.63	No further details of expansion plans were given.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_449.wav	2.39	The budget was too low for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_450.wav	2.39	Our legal advice is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_451.wav	3.29	Striking the deal has come as a big relief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_452.wav	3.24	A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_453.wav	2.56	They were good years for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_454.wav	2.69	Let that be their memorial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_455.wav	2.52	This is the stuff of live music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_456.wav	3.50	We expect a rise by the end of the second quarter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_457.wav	2.60	We will deal with the refugees.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_458.wav	3.03	If that's the case, he will struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_459.wav	2.18	We are over the moon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_460.wav	2.39	They're just a good retailer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_461.wav	2.22	We are now up against it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p270\p270_462.wav	2.74	Something happened on that island.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_001.wav	3.16	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_002.wav	4.35	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_003.wav	9.01	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_004.wav	5.89	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_005.wav	7.64	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_006.wav	6.61	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_007.wav	5.25	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_008.wav	9.52	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_009.wav	5.38	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_010.wav	3.59	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_011.wav	8.79	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_012.wav	5.72	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_013.wav	5.68	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_014.wav	5.72	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_015.wav	7.43	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_016.wav	7.64	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_017.wav	4.27	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_018.wav	8.54	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_019.wav	9.13	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_020.wav	4.36	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_021.wav	10.50	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_022.wav	9.60	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_023.wav	16.56	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_024.wav	8.03	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_025.wav	2.65	She looked so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_026.wav	3.71	We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_027.wav	5.08	Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_028.wav	3.84	I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_029.wav	2.14	They have no history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_030.wav	3.88	However, the following year the cancer returned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_031.wav	3.80	Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_032.wav	2.09	I'd just like to play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_033.wav	2.35	This is the window.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_034.wav	3.16	I feel I did not have enough time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_035.wav	2.56	We speak about the performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_036.wav	3.84	IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_037.wav	2.35	It was clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_038.wav	2.05	Indeed, he does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_039.wav	4.57	People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_040.wav	4.61	It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_041.wav	5.76	It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_042.wav	2.01	We will push.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_043.wav	2.14	I hate the word.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_044.wav	2.82	They said she was stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_045.wav	2.86	Among them are many criminals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_046.wav	3.03	Is a drug dealer?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_047.wav	2.52	There is no reason at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_048.wav	2.77	He is too weak to move.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_049.wav	3.97	They were on holiday in Egypt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_050.wav	3.72	Every aspect of our play was first class.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_051.wav	4.27	No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_052.wav	1.88	Here's a clue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_053.wav	3.58	Her body was found about four miles from the car.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_054.wav	2.35	I guess I was lucky, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_055.wav	2.56	I was inspired by two things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_056.wav	3.67	For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_057.wav	2.01	I love the Dome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_058.wav	1.84	It's so awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_059.wav	1.75	It is unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_060.wav	3.29	I expect a rapid response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_061.wav	1.97	That's the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_062.wav	1.71	Jobs could go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_063.wav	4.57	We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_064.wav	2.56	Scotland had great assets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_065.wav	2.69	It's that kind of place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_066.wav	1.62	They are real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_067.wav	3.12	It's good news and long overdue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_068.wav	4.78	There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_069.wav	2.18	We should have known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_070.wav	3.33	Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_071.wav	2.05	Try to save us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_072.wav	4.27	He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_073.wav	2.78	He was at home with his pals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_074.wav	2.48	It's all I can do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_075.wav	2.62	There could be a way back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_076.wav	2.91	Then followed a bout of flu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_077.wav	6.70	Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_078.wav	2.01	Neither it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_079.wav	3.33	Is there a new way forward?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_080.wav	2.56	The party is up for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_081.wav	2.82	Even the one she loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_082.wav	2.52	He is in the queue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_083.wav	2.01	He is driven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_084.wav	2.95	A play is a set of actions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_085.wav	4.18	Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_086.wav	2.05	Someone who cares
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_087.wav	3.46	By then, he was walking on water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_088.wav	4.99	It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_089.wav	2.26	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_090.wav	4.83	The city council is a major property owner in the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_091.wav	5.08	Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_092.wav	1.88	It is a lifeline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_093.wav	3.29	Maloney is an engaging talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_094.wav	2.14	He was possessed
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_095.wav	5.08	I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_096.wav	2.09	This one did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_097.wav	2.65	Then came the crunch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_098.wav	1.97	It is annoying.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_099.wav	2.35	It is home-grown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_100.wav	2.69	They are now divorced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_101.wav	3.29	I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_102.wav	2.35	I saw the whole thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_103.wav	4.44	However, we have not come to any conclusions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_104.wav	3.29	I'm not looking for a breakthrough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_105.wav	2.43	It is a love affair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_106.wav	4.06	They make a selective perception process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_107.wav	2.65	That would be unlawful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_108.wav	3.12	We have an election in eight days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_109.wav	2.30	He takes the job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_110.wav	2.43	She reflects a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_111.wav	3.24	The cause of the fire is not yet known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_112.wav	5.89	Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_113.wav	3.97	According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_114.wav	1.92	I am an actor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_115.wav	3.37	He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_116.wav	2.56	It was the eighties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_117.wav	3.67	I did not see any reason to change the captain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_118.wav	2.01	It is so sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_119.wav	2.48	You had better believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_120.wav	1.80	It's not fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_121.wav	5.04	Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_122.wav	5.17	That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_123.wav	2.05	Who would have?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_124.wav	4.99	We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_125.wav	4.52	His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_126.wav	1.96	The people will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_127.wav	5.12	The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_128.wav	4.23	The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_129.wav	3.25	The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_130.wav	2.26	We work well together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_131.wav	2.22	What will happen then?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_132.wav	4.61	Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_133.wav	4.10	Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_134.wav	4.78	Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_135.wav	3.03	It was very frightened and dirty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_136.wav	1.84	Is that it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_137.wav	2.61	My daughter is an adult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_138.wav	2.22	He should resign.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_139.wav	1.62	I was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_140.wav	5.21	If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_141.wav	3.93	It seems so long since I did the exams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_142.wav	3.93	Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_143.wav	4.95	And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_144.wav	2.52	She died at her home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_145.wav	2.69	He realises his mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_146.wav	4.70	Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_147.wav	2.27	I was awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_148.wav	5.46	He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_149.wav	1.97	Note the date.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_150.wav	2.65	So I got a blood test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_151.wav	5.59	It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_152.wav	4.48	The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_153.wav	3.76	The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_154.wav	3.07	The weather forecast isn't good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_155.wav	4.49	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_156.wav	2.43	Work has started.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_157.wav	1.97	My Dad is a hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_158.wav	4.40	This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_159.wav	2.77	Words were not required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_160.wav	3.24	Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_161.wav	2.65	That includes the equipment?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_162.wav	2.65	These days are long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_163.wav	2.56	I'd love to be like Peter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_164.wav	4.31	It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_165.wav	2.31	It has to be now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_166.wav	3.03	I haven't had a lesson in four years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_167.wav	2.52	As, indeed, they would be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_168.wav	5.68	Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_169.wav	2.52	They are not advertised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_170.wav	5.98	The consultants report commissioned by the previous Government was not published.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_171.wav	2.65	Tell it like it was?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_172.wav	4.95	It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_173.wav	3.03	We have a budget in March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_174.wav	4.23	By then, however, both men were already in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_175.wav	3.41	You had to go and see him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_176.wav	4.48	It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_177.wav	2.43	It is really good news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_178.wav	2.39	He was a crazy man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_179.wav	4.65	They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_180.wav	3.03	One season, they might do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_181.wav	2.26	As we worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_182.wav	5.59	However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_183.wav	4.27	The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_184.wav	3.07	If that's the case, he will struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_185.wav	4.10	I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_186.wav	5.04	The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_187.wav	2.35	The goals were good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_188.wav	1.79	I've been there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_189.wav	6.23	And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_190.wav	4.14	It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_191.wav	3.67	I saw military vehicles in the distance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_192.wav	4.01	What has caused the demise of singing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_193.wav	2.39	One was a lawyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_194.wav	5.97	A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_195.wav	3.38	Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_196.wav	4.57	However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_197.wav	5.51	Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_198.wav	4.70	I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_199.wav	2.65	It is a farce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_200.wav	4.82	It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_201.wav	2.31	I came home by ambulance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_202.wav	4.57	The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_203.wav	2.13	It opened last month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_204.wav	3.20	We believe a third party was involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_205.wav	3.88	On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_206.wav	2.91	Tommy is not a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_207.wav	4.87	I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_208.wav	2.95	He had suffered a heart attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_209.wav	3.12	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_210.wav	3.42	We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_211.wav	2.99	I don't want to use it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_212.wav	3.88	This gives a financial incentive to switch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_213.wav	1.92	You have a plan?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_214.wav	3.24	It had all been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_215.wav	2.82	I had decided to quit the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_216.wav	4.36	I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_217.wav	3.54	However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_218.wav	1.75	I might come back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_219.wav	5.85	The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_220.wav	2.31	That idea is rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_221.wav	3.20	The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_222.wav	4.78	But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_223.wav	2.69	We could easily be cut again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_224.wav	2.69	He seemed to lose his focus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_225.wav	2.69	If it doesn't, it doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_226.wav	4.70	Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_227.wav	2.56	Clearly, the stakes are high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_228.wav	1.92	I will win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_229.wav	2.26	I am immensely sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_230.wav	2.52	It's not before time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_231.wav	3.72	He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_232.wav	5.04	Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_233.wav	3.37	At the time, he was a living legend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_234.wav	4.44	Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_235.wav	5.04	The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_236.wav	4.14	Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_237.wav	1.88	We were awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_238.wav	2.48	They tried to give her advice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_239.wav	2.18	We are so proud.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_240.wav	4.23	Half of young people had had contact with the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_241.wav	3.88	He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_242.wav	2.28	It's quite nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_243.wav	2.91	Three weeks later, he resigned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_244.wav	4.87	On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_245.wav	4.40	It would still have been a good film, but very different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_246.wav	4.18	Of further privacy, he had no need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_247.wav	4.40	I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_248.wav	3.72	He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_249.wav	5.51	Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_250.wav	2.43	It is hard won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_251.wav	3.76	We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_252.wav	2.95	You can feel at home in China.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_253.wav	2.35	The scene is about this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_254.wav	5.38	The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_255.wav	4.14	In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_256.wav	3.63	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_257.wav	2.39	The concerns are the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_258.wav	2.65	That could be in place by next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_259.wav	4.31	That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_260.wav	5.34	However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_261.wav	2.73	Chelsea was a great club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_262.wav	2.99	Is that a serious question?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_263.wav	2.39	This is the first step.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_264.wav	4.27	However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_265.wav	4.27	This court has made an order which has not been observed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_266.wav	2.73	Blood samples were taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_267.wav	2.86	We shall rely on human beings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_268.wav	2.61	This is a question of Islam.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_269.wav	4.70	That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_270.wav	1.97	You take a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_271.wav	5.47	He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_272.wav	3.07	He was also married with two children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_273.wav	4.52	It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_274.wav	3.72	The prison has been affected by unrest in the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_275.wav	5.08	Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_276.wav	2.73	That goes back a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_277.wav	5.25	The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_278.wav	3.03	She failed in her action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_279.wav	2.82	They seem to get away with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_280.wav	5.08	He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_281.wav	4.01	In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_282.wav	4.70	Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_283.wav	2.73	We are a grandmother.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_284.wav	2.82	He looked very sharp.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_285.wav	4.87	There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_286.wav	4.61	Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_287.wav	2.48	You feel very helpless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_288.wav	3.20	You've got to have both sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_289.wav	3.84	They have shown a great desire and attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_290.wav	2.56	It was a virus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_291.wav	3.63	She is an expert on medical ethics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_292.wav	3.50	It's a record label, not a form of music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_293.wav	5.89	The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_294.wav	2.78	This is a national crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_295.wav	2.86	We are not going to forget.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_296.wav	2.73	No Briton has ever won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_297.wav	5.21	He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_298.wav	5.25	I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_299.wav	4.48	In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_300.wav	1.97	Nothing is safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_301.wav	5.38	The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_302.wav	2.13	There is no openness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_303.wav	1.75	They are wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_304.wav	3.67	Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_305.wav	2.86	This is a war over our home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_306.wav	4.83	Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_307.wav	4.78	The court had a number of empty seats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_308.wav	5.89	The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_309.wav	2.26	The plot is minimal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_310.wav	4.36	It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_311.wav	2.01	There is no excuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_312.wav	2.73	The letters are going out today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_313.wav	4.70	The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_314.wav	5.85	and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_315.wav	3.16	The Premier League has been a huge success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_316.wav	2.52	My whole life has changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_317.wav	2.48	We are a peaceful people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_318.wav	3.29	The election is total confusion and chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_319.wav	2.86	Henman has been warned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_320.wav	5.25	It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_321.wav	3.84	For the moment, our position remains the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_322.wav	2.31	They had a confession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_323.wav	2.82	We are in the end game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_324.wav	2.26	It will work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_325.wav	2.78	It's too horrible to think.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_326.wav	4.36	They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_327.wav	2.69	There was no time scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_328.wav	4.02	But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_329.wav	2.82	It is a job creation scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_330.wav	3.50	Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_331.wav	2.78	Relief was beyond belief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_332.wav	1.84	Is that an issue?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_333.wav	3.16	They should take their mobile phones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_334.wav	3.80	You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_335.wav	3.80	The same things will happen with GM foods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_336.wav	3.84	The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_337.wav	2.05	Who will do it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_338.wav	3.33	That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_339.wav	3.54	Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_340.wav	2.39	I've got no secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_341.wav	2.43	This is a big advantage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_342.wav	2.52	went on sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_343.wav	3.54	Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_344.wav	4.52	A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_345.wav	5.80	This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_346.wav	4.14	A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_347.wav	2.31	I got a yellow card.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_348.wav	2.31	We have big ideas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_349.wav	3.07	I believe the gap is nearly there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_350.wav	5.21	He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_351.wav	5.21	Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_352.wav	2.82	Until they came to do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_353.wav	2.26	It is not like us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_354.wav	4.27	It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_355.wav	5.08	To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_356.wav	1.50	We will be homeless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_357.wav	1.92	That would help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_358.wav	2.01	My husband was angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_359.wav	4.44	Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_360.wav	2.13	It is a memorial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_361.wav	2.01	And he laughs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_362.wav	4.53	He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_363.wav	4.02	There was a substantial explosion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_364.wav	3.16	It's not pretty, but it's effective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_365.wav	2.31	Their time has gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_366.wav	2.99	It has only been rumours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_367.wav	4.23	All the investment is possible through the public sector.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_368.wav	2.99	The death rates are still as high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_369.wav	2.65	Now, though, he has an incentive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_370.wav	4.27	Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_371.wav	2.76	It seems a long time ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_372.wav	2.60	There is no signature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_373.wav	4.14	Washington is consumed by the crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_374.wav	2.86	It became a national network.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_375.wav	2.82	I am a wealthy person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_376.wav	2.90	The BBC was a disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_377.wav	3.72	The Cabinet is split over the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_378.wav	4.27	Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_379.wav	3.07	It has been a lovely family occasion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_380.wav	2.48	That's the name of the game, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_381.wav	3.85	Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_382.wav	6.15	Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_383.wav	2.69	Yet the data is compelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_384.wav	2.05	It's a real problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_385.wav	3.67	On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_386.wav	2.48	Who will provide the wine?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_387.wav	2.18	It is unusual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_388.wav	2.39	They deserved the win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_389.wav	4.19	Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_390.wav	3.33	Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_391.wav	5.12	I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_392.wav	5.98	The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_393.wav	4.82	He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_394.wav	2.56	But we are a young side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_395.wav	4.70	By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_396.wav	2.56	It will take place in July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_397.wav	4.91	The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_398.wav	3.76	Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_399.wav	2.99	But, in fact, the reverse is true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_400.wav	2.22	It is full-scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_401.wav	3.12	I never won a penny throughout my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_402.wav	2.99	He will be judged by his actions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_403.wav	2.52	It is an absolute nonsense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_404.wav	2.78	They are not left wing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_405.wav	3.20	They recorded their debut album in New York.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_406.wav	2.39	In a way he was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_407.wav	3.80	However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_408.wav	1.75	It might be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_409.wav	2.99	The weekly average was three hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_410.wav	2.78	He scored a touchdown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_411.wav	4.44	Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_412.wav	2.14	He got his degree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_413.wav	4.31	The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_414.wav	4.27	Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_415.wav	2.35	But we finished the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_416.wav	4.53	Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_417.wav	5.42	The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_418.wav	1.67	That may be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_419.wav	2.35	It is legally binding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_420.wav	4.19	Is there any prospect of this happening?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_421.wav	3.12	The service from the other players was super.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_422.wav	3.76	I've invented a village in East Lothian.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_423.wav	3.33	Paris is not only young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_424.wav	4.27	That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_425.wav	2.35	He is to appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_426.wav	3.08	It was like someone had died.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_427.wav	2.09	I'm very grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_428.wav	4.19	The weather in the area of the crash was severe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_429.wav	3.67	We have the location, which is assured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_430.wav	4.78	There is no suggestion of any sinister intent on his behalf.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_431.wav	3.50	Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_432.wav	3.03	I know the worry over Iraq.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_433.wav	2.52	Everything has collapsed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_434.wav	4.99	Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_435.wav	3.76	It is not either national standards or local control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_436.wav	5.04	The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_437.wav	2.10	We are all equal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_438.wav	2.05	Admission is free.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_439.wav	2.90	We are now up against it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_440.wav	2.44	In it went.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_441.wav	1.88	We were used.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_442.wav	4.74	Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_443.wav	3.80	There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_444.wav	5.12	However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_445.wav	4.18	They were not even allowed to see them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_446.wav	4.66	That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_447.wav	3.12	Bill is a mentor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_448.wav	4.19	We are certainly moving in the right direction as a club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_449.wav	3.58	It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_450.wav	1.75	Was it worth it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_451.wav	2.18	It was ignored.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_452.wav	2.01	It is bizarre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_453.wav	3.24	It had been in place since last July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p271\p271_454.wav	2.01	It's a miracle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_002.wav	4.23	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_003.wav	7.43	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_004.wav	4.61	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_005.wav	6.23	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_006.wav	5.68	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_007.wav	4.31	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_008.wav	7.04	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_009.wav	4.74	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_010.wav	2.91	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_011.wav	6.23	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_012.wav	4.95	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_013.wav	3.63	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_014.wav	4.36	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_015.wav	5.81	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_016.wav	5.72	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_017.wav	3.63	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_018.wav	5.21	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_019.wav	6.57	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_020.wav	3.84	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_021.wav	8.41	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_022.wav	6.27	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_023.wav	10.16	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_024.wav	6.45	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_025.wav	3.80	People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_026.wav	1.84	Is this accurate?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_027.wav	1.88	They have no history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_028.wav	3.24	Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_029.wav	2.95	The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_030.wav	2.09	There's a story, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_031.wav	1.88	This is the window.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_032.wav	2.56	He was jailed for five years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_033.wav	4.65	Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_034.wav	4.99	We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_035.wav	2.91	Then, suddenly, they weren't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_036.wav	1.71	Was it worth it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_037.wav	4.06	Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_038.wav	3.59	However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_039.wav	3.38	We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_040.wav	2.22	They're just different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_041.wav	4.82	Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_042.wav	3.71	A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_043.wav	2.27	Indeed, he does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_044.wav	8.58	I did not see any reason to change the captain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_045.wav	2.95	He's just in it for himself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_046.wav	4.70	However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_047.wav	4.57	It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_048.wav	2.43	We will push.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_049.wav	4.74	Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_050.wav	2.95	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_051.wav	1.80	It is bizarre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_052.wav	2.22	They said she was stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_053.wav	2.18	Is a drug dealer?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_054.wav	4.14	The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_055.wav	2.56	He is too weak to move.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_056.wav	2.48	They were on holiday in Egypt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_057.wav	2.22	He looks like an Afghan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_058.wav	3.71	No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_059.wav	1.88	Here's a clue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_060.wav	3.50	It had been in place since last July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_061.wav	2.86	Next league matches Celtic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_062.wav	2.56	There was no safety net.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_063.wav	1.80	It is unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_064.wav	1.88	That's the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_065.wav	1.67	They are ready.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_066.wav	3.59	We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_067.wav	2.56	I feel I did not have enough time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_068.wav	4.14	The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_069.wav	4.57	George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_070.wav	1.88	They are real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_071.wav	4.82	Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_072.wav	2.74	That was a gold medal for certain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_073.wav	2.73	He was popular.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_074.wav	2.69	But I've won both ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_075.wav	2.09	There was an e-mail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_076.wav	2.31	Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_077.wav	2.99	Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_078.wav	3.03	Painful, but only because it's true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_079.wav	2.61	I had my suspicions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_080.wav	2.65	He was at home with his pals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_081.wav	1.88	It was magic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_082.wav	4.22	The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_083.wav	2.73	It is a job creation scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_084.wav	4.14	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_085.wav	2.14	Even the one she loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_086.wav	2.39	Today she has been released.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_087.wav	1.92	He is in the queue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_088.wav	3.20	He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_089.wav	3.37	What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_090.wav	3.12	Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_091.wav	1.88	Someone who cares
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_092.wav	2.90	By then, he was walking on water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_093.wav	3.89	It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_094.wav	1.67	It is a blow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_095.wav	3.24	Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_096.wav	2.48	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_097.wav	4.44	Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_098.wav	2.31	Today I couldn't run on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_099.wav	3.67	This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_100.wav	3.80	I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_101.wav	1.62	It was clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_102.wav	1.92	It is annoying.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_103.wav	1.84	But I was wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_104.wav	1.88	I love the Dome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_105.wav	4.57	We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_106.wav	3.03	Our position remains unchanged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_107.wav	3.03	I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_108.wav	4.10	Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_109.wav	3.71	Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_110.wav	1.75	You should be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_111.wav	4.10	After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_112.wav	2.52	Two of the team became ill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_113.wav	1.80	He takes the job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_114.wav	2.01	She reflects a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_115.wav	2.65	I am just trying to do my job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_116.wav	5.21	Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_117.wav	3.80	While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_118.wav	3.03	I was fighting for my life, I thought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_119.wav	4.65	Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_120.wav	1.67	It is so sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_121.wav	2.18	The mood is upbeat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_122.wav	1.62	It is rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_123.wav	3.93	That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_124.wav	3.88	There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_125.wav	2.27	Who would have?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_126.wav	3.03	There were no grounds for his action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_127.wav	2.82	I can't even get into the A team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_128.wav	1.71	I'm so angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_129.wav	2.48	She really suffered for her art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_130.wav	3.50	It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_131.wav	4.06	The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_132.wav	2.31	No production was achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_133.wav	2.61	The BBC was a disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_134.wav	3.72	This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_135.wav	4.19	It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_136.wav	2.78	The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_137.wav	3.72	Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_138.wav	3.67	Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_139.wav	4.23	On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_140.wav	4.39	It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_141.wav	2.52	I had decided to quit the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_142.wav	2.31	We want to keep the pound.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_143.wav	3.42	Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_144.wav	4.31	And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_145.wav	1.92	Who would be right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_146.wav	1.92	She died at her home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_147.wav	2.44	He realises his mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_148.wav	3.12	The role of the law lords would be retained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_149.wav	2.18	It is not just about pay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_150.wav	5.68	Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_151.wav	2.26	So I got a blood test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_152.wav	4.35	It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_153.wav	3.97	But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_154.wav	1.92	I was so nervous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_155.wav	4.57	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_156.wav	4.87	The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_157.wav	2.65	We also enjoyed a lot of support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_158.wav	2.82	We are on a four-year mission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_159.wav	2.10	They should come clean.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_160.wav	2.09	My Dad is a hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_161.wav	1.92	He can do no wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_162.wav	2.35	Well, he should know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_163.wav	2.18	It is so unfair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_164.wav	1.58	I will tell you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_165.wav	3.76	I've put my own money into this project.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_166.wav	4.40	Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_167.wav	2.10	It is not like us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_168.wav	2.05	We've all had the shots.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_169.wav	5.21	It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_170.wav	2.18	Again, we were lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_171.wav	3.97	Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_172.wav	2.31	Does that put pressure on us?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_173.wav	4.14	It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_174.wav	3.46	They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_175.wav	1.92	As we worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_176.wav	2.01	Tony had arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_177.wav	4.40	And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_178.wav	4.65	Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_179.wav	4.31	It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_180.wav	2.95	They need to look after themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_181.wav	3.88	I saw military vehicles in the distance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_182.wav	2.99	What has caused the demise of singing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_183.wav	2.48	Our team is just so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_184.wav	4.23	Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_185.wav	3.07	Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_186.wav	5.38	Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_187.wav	4.18	But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_188.wav	2.82	Peace was won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_189.wav	1.66	It's a fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_190.wav	4.61	The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_191.wav	2.95	We believe a third party was involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_192.wav	3.93	On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_193.wav	2.44	Tommy is not a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_194.wav	5.12	I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_195.wav	2.39	But she might be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_196.wav	4.05	I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_197.wav	2.69	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_198.wav	3.24	They make a selective perception process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_199.wav	3.33	We have an election in eight days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_200.wav	3.46	Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_201.wav	2.95	This gives a financial incentive to switch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_202.wav	4.10	The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_203.wav	2.86	Twaddle is a case in point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_204.wav	3.29	A Grampian Police spokesman said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_205.wav	3.63	He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_206.wav	2.90	In each case they were a goal down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_207.wav	3.63	I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_208.wav	3.76	However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_209.wav	4.31	The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_210.wav	3.37	The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_211.wav	3.97	Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_212.wav	4.86	I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_213.wav	4.01	At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_214.wav	4.48	You should always be able to get out in some direction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_215.wav	3.72	It's not before time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_216.wav	2.86	The report is due out next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_217.wav	1.96	But she was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_218.wav	5.72	Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_219.wav	3.29	At the time, he was a living legend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_220.wav	2.18	They must do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_221.wav	4.40	Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_222.wav	3.71	However, no further action was taken by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_223.wav	2.09	Until they came to do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_224.wav	3.80	Half of young people had had contact with the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_225.wav	2.99	Well, they were the unlucky ones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_226.wav	1.96	There is no excuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_227.wav	2.73	Three weeks later, he resigned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_228.wav	4.14	On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_229.wav	2.61	But it's a subtle process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_230.wav	3.29	He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_231.wav	4.01	Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_232.wav	3.29	In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_233.wav	4.02	A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_234.wav	1.88	It is hard won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_235.wav	2.35	Our policy is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_236.wav	2.61	The scene is about this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_237.wav	4.27	The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_238.wav	3.03	There wasn't a goal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_239.wav	2.44	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_240.wav	2.22	There's the mix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_241.wav	2.39	The concerns are the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_242.wav	2.26	I can't get a job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_243.wav	4.78	For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_244.wav	3.93	It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_245.wav	4.83	However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_246.wav	4.14	One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_247.wav	4.02	So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_248.wav	2.39	Is that a serious question?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_249.wav	2.18	This is the first step.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_250.wav	2.35	They must play for each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_251.wav	2.31	Souter will be back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_252.wav	5.04	George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_253.wav	2.05	Blood samples were taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_254.wav	2.90	They want to shut the Scottish Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_255.wav	2.90	We shall rely on human beings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_256.wav	2.60	This is a question of Islam.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_257.wav	5.21	He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_258.wav	2.82	Immediate action must be taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_259.wav	2.31	It's very nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_260.wav	3.20	He was also married with two children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_261.wav	2.22	The system can work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_262.wav	4.35	It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_263.wav	2.39	We're in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_264.wav	3.08	Our objective is to tackle poverty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_265.wav	2.26	It's a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_266.wav	4.31	The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_267.wav	2.18	It was very fast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_268.wav	2.90	The record companies have gone through the floor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_269.wav	3.76	He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_270.wav	4.23	In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_271.wav	2.78	If not, he should go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_272.wav	4.01	It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_273.wav	2.60	He looked very sharp.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_274.wav	3.80	There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_275.wav	2.09	All options are open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_276.wav	2.13	Dialogue is the key.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_277.wav	3.29	They have shown a great desire and attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_278.wav	1.88	It was a virus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_279.wav	2.99	Maloney is an engaging talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_280.wav	4.44	The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_281.wav	2.56	This is a national crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_282.wav	1.92	It was good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_283.wav	2.22	Who did the recruiting?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_284.wav	2.73	Bombing slaughter rejected
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_285.wav	2.52	The songs are just so good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_286.wav	1.96	The goals will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_287.wav	2.05	There's a pause.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_288.wav	4.78	That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_289.wav	2.31	I was the sheep.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_290.wav	1.84	What has altered?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_291.wav	3.20	I was brought up in a mining background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_292.wav	2.43	Nothing is safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_293.wav	4.27	It would still have been a good film, but very different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_294.wav	2.01	One was a lawyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_295.wav	4.48	The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_296.wav	2.35	They are wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_297.wav	4.48	Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_298.wav	2.78	The plot is minimal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_299.wav	2.18	You are the glory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_300.wav	4.23	However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_301.wav	2.90	The letters are going out today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_302.wav	2.52	We want to play at the worlds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_303.wav	3.97	He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_304.wav	2.52	My whole life has changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_305.wav	2.18	We are a peaceful people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_306.wav	2.31	You may have a short memory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_307.wav	4.14	It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_308.wav	2.48	My body is clearly capable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_309.wav	4.18	Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_310.wav	3.76	It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_311.wav	2.39	A review is under way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_312.wav	1.96	It will work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_313.wav	2.99	I came into this world with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_314.wav	2.73	It's too horrible to think.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_315.wav	3.67	We think all other measures are not exhausted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_316.wav	2.05	Off with their heads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_317.wav	2.22	Is there a new way forward?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_318.wav	2.69	I was invited to work in Germany.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_319.wav	1.75	Is that an issue?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_320.wav	3.59	Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_321.wav	3.29	You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_322.wav	3.29	The same things will happen with GM foods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_323.wav	3.29	I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_324.wav	2.95	It sounded as if it might well be tragic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_325.wav	2.61	Well, it won't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_326.wav	3.25	These days are long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_327.wav	2.52	Two people were interviewed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_328.wav	2.22	I've got no secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_329.wav	4.10	The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_330.wav	4.18	We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_331.wav	4.14	In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_332.wav	4.70	Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_333.wav	4.10	A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_334.wav	4.35	This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_335.wav	2.52	He loves the big occasions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_336.wav	2.22	The performance was excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_337.wav	2.22	That has been lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_338.wav	2.44	Tell us about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_339.wav	4.48	He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_340.wav	2.18	She said they would appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_341.wav	4.78	A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_342.wav	4.27	Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_343.wav	3.24	Both of those promises have already been honoured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_344.wav	3.33	In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_345.wav	3.50	It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_346.wav	3.63	As, indeed, they would be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_347.wav	3.33	It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_348.wav	4.14	To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_349.wav	2.05	We will be homeless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_350.wav	4.53	Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_351.wav	3.72	Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_352.wav	3.84	Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_353.wav	2.73	There was a substantial explosion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_354.wav	2.86	Not so, it seems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_355.wav	2.22	He could make it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_356.wav	2.52	Four policemen were wounded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_357.wav	4.74	We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_358.wav	3.46	It's now down in black and white.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_359.wav	3.71	Now, though, he has an incentive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_360.wav	4.27	Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_361.wav	3.63	They have not done so this season so far.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_362.wav	3.33	This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_363.wav	3.25	It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_364.wav	2.95	So there, we won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_365.wav	4.06	By that time, however, it was already too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_366.wav	2.13	There is no signature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_367.wav	2.30	It was a funny game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_368.wav	2.39	He was the architect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_369.wav	4.10	I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_370.wav	2.56	I've never seen a game like it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_371.wav	2.14	I am a wealthy person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_372.wav	4.31	Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_373.wav	4.01	He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_374.wav	3.33	The Cabinet is split over the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_375.wav	2.05	Something is wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_376.wav	2.18	You can cope with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_377.wav	3.50	I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_378.wav	2.74	That's the name of the game, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_379.wav	4.06	Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_380.wav	4.91	Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_381.wav	4.18	Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_382.wav	3.55	At the last I found a bunker.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_383.wav	2.69	Yet the data is compelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_384.wav	4.10	One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_385.wav	2.31	It's a real problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_386.wav	4.06	On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_387.wav	3.16	I was in the train station overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_388.wav	1.97	It is unusual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_389.wav	3.80	The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_390.wav	2.56	It's like a basketball.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_391.wav	3.97	Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_392.wav	3.80	I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_393.wav	4.02	The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_394.wav	3.03	It was a kind of contempt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_395.wav	2.52	It was a breathtaking moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_396.wav	3.59	The car was just there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_397.wav	2.56	It will take place in July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_398.wav	4.14	The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_399.wav	1.84	Is that possible?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_400.wav	4.05	But, in fact, the reverse is true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_401.wav	2.69	What was the difference between them?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_402.wav	2.35	Emotions were complex.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_403.wav	2.86	Then , he laughs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_404.wav	4.78	Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_405.wav	8.79	It is an absolute nonsense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_406.wav	3.16	They recorded their debut album in New York.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_407.wav	4.44	However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_408.wav	3.97	He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_409.wav	4.61	But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_410.wav	3.29	Feel the air, the space.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_411.wav	1.88	He got his degree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p272\p272_412.wav	4.31	I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_002.wav	3.88	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_003.wav	7.73	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_004.wav	5.46	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_005.wav	7.43	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_006.wav	6.15	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_007.wav	4.69	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_008.wav	8.58	These take the shape of a long round arch, and its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_009.wav	5.72	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_010.wav	3.50	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_011.wav	6.74	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_012.wav	4.52	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_013.wav	5.04	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_014.wav	5.16	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_015.wav	6.19	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_016.wav	7.21	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_017.wav	3.93	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_018.wav	5.34	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_019.wav	7.77	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_020.wav	4.14	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_021.wav	9.26	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_022.wav	6.96	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_023.wav	12.72	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_024.wav	7.90	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_025.wav	4.05	A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_026.wav	3.46	It was as if I had been stabbed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_027.wav	2.39	Because we do not need it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_028.wav	3.29	It is about control of our economy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_029.wav	3.50	Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_030.wav	3.84	It is a tough game but we have a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_031.wav	3.67	I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_032.wav	2.43	It carries a double message.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_033.wav	2.90	That is the face of fear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_034.wav	3.63	The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_035.wav	2.95	Among them are many criminals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_036.wav	2.86	This will save interest charges.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_037.wav	3.97	Every aspect of our play was first class.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_038.wav	2.22	He looks like an Afghan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_039.wav	2.69	Everything else is a bonus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_040.wav	3.12	People want to see me on the screen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_041.wav	3.88	Her body was found about four miles from the car.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_042.wav	3.25	I was inspired by two things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_043.wav	3.80	Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_044.wav	2.82	My fitness was very poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_045.wav	3.12	We have to look beyond the very short term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_046.wav	3.41	The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_047.wav	2.43	I expect a rapid response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_048.wav	2.22	I must take a seat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_049.wav	2.99	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_050.wav	2.09	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_051.wav	2.39	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_052.wav	2.39	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_053.wav	2.52	What do we do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_054.wav	3.93	The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_055.wav	2.39	Let's hope that it does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_056.wav	2.43	We have to keep our clients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_057.wav	4.74	Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_058.wav	2.39	We will pay their bills.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_059.wav	3.07	It was exactly four months away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_060.wav	3.07	Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_061.wav	2.86	I was conceived in Aberdeen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_062.wav	3.33	Robin Williams is very subdued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_063.wav	3.63	The spirit in the dressing room is tremendous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_064.wav	2.65	I was as strong as a horse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_065.wav	3.76	We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_066.wav	3.50	They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_067.wav	2.86	Both sides have been hit by injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_068.wav	2.91	The creditors have lost a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_069.wav	3.67	Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_070.wav	2.73	Even the one she loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_071.wav	4.27	Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_072.wav	3.63	After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_073.wav	3.29	It makes for an interesting conference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_074.wav	4.31	This view was echoed by another Scottish analyst.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_075.wav	2.86	No progress has been made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_076.wav	2.99	He has been a success this year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_077.wav	4.05	They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_078.wav	2.99	We have to offer value for money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_079.wav	3.63	That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_080.wav	2.69	It's so hard to shift.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_081.wav	2.18	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_082.wav	2.65	Potions said he would drive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_083.wav	2.90	Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_084.wav	3.41	He had missed a penalty against the English.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_085.wav	3.76	The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_086.wav	4.31	I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_087.wav	3.88	He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_088.wav	2.86	It was clear on Thursday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_089.wav	2.61	It was a family tragedy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_090.wav	3.97	It's not a holiday time for football players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_091.wav	3.29	They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_092.wav	2.48	He was prepared for this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_093.wav	3.12	Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_094.wav	3.33	We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_095.wav	2.61	We intend to change the model.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_096.wav	3.84	We should recognise that others have done a good job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_097.wav	3.29	But the battle has only just begun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_098.wav	3.89	The following are the principal provisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_099.wav	2.86	Before the game we went for a pint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_100.wav	2.82	Athletics is on a roll in the country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_101.wav	2.90	I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_102.wav	3.97	While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_103.wav	2.52	We deserve a significant rise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_104.wav	2.47	Got to win today, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_105.wav	2.09	The pressure is on them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_106.wav	2.22	New Year will be very busy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_107.wav	2.61	There's still plenty of time left.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_108.wav	2.60	I didn't think so either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_109.wav	2.39	He thought she was amazing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_110.wav	2.99	I came here this week to work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_111.wav	3.76	Then again, we could have.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_112.wav	4.49	Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_113.wav	2.69	Here, again, they were denied a voice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_114.wav	2.44	We would make a start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_115.wav	2.73	His job was not advertised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_116.wav	2.69	This is a frightening development.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_117.wav	2.44	Which can happen any time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_118.wav	2.43	That is far too high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_119.wav	2.35	My life has changed a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_120.wav	4.23	Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_121.wav	3.12	That would open the gates of hell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_122.wav	2.35	You are a gambling man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_123.wav	2.44	It feels like a privilege.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_124.wav	2.69	That is the ultimate revenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_125.wav	2.65	I am totally devoted to this job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_126.wav	2.31	We'll have to think about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_127.wav	2.95	I love the spectacle of cinema.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_128.wav	5.42	The findings are published in the British Journal of Cancer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_129.wav	2.43	I'm so grateful for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_130.wav	3.63	The study is expected to last until the middle of the year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_131.wav	2.31	There's always the next century.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_132.wav	3.29	There's only one team in Ayrshire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_133.wav	2.69	The weather forecast isn't good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_134.wav	2.86	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_135.wav	2.18	Behind him was his brother.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_136.wav	2.10	She had gone to the Catholic school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_137.wav	4.57	One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_138.wav	3.25	It would seem a natural progression.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_139.wav	3.03	It was a terrible combination of factors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_140.wav	2.26	Today is not a victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_141.wav	2.09	Why do it otherwise ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_142.wav	3.03	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_143.wav	2.31	So, did she meet him ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_144.wav	2.86	So what is the campaign about ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_145.wav	1.58	And does it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_146.wav	2.05	Are you from the rugby ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_147.wav	2.65	Had I heard ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_148.wav	3.41	This action reflects a slump in bookings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_149.wav	2.31	They should stop the bombing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_150.wav	3.33	The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_151.wav	2.78	I'm not going to answer that right now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_152.wav	2.82	It's never great to finish second.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_153.wav	3.89	The long-term trend is certainly moving towards a balance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_154.wav	3.50	Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_155.wav	2.26	They could not match it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_156.wav	3.08	I always felt they played for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_157.wav	3.08	His team management was protective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_158.wav	3.03	One season, they might do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_159.wav	1.80	The jury is still out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_160.wav	2.39	Phase one was a shambles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_161.wav	2.73	I did not have a bet on myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_162.wav	2.90	It is also very valuable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_163.wav	4.35	For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_164.wav	3.29	They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_165.wav	1.92	Says the Duke of York.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_166.wav	2.78	They bought the property four years ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_167.wav	2.39	Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_168.wav	3.93	DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_169.wav	2.05	You know the sort of thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_170.wav	2.65	It was a bit like having children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_171.wav	2.73	It shows the strength of the roots.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_172.wav	3.25	It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_173.wav	2.74	This youngster is so exciting!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_174.wav	2.39	Two years later, she was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_175.wav	2.52	It's very difficult to find a buyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_176.wav	3.37	Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_177.wav	2.61	Everyone can have their opinion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_178.wav	2.52	Because he was born in England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_179.wav	2.31	I came home by ambulance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_180.wav	2.43	What happened in that game ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_181.wav	3.97	Are you going to win ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_182.wav	1.75	Was it the wife ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_183.wav	2.10	Why change it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_184.wav	2.56	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_185.wav	3.03	We've had an enjoyable adventure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_186.wav	2.69	It comes from reflection or thinking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_187.wav	2.01	It was a moment of madness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_188.wav	2.95	They have the cash and the fire power.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_189.wav	3.42	The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_190.wav	3.20	The early physical reports were clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_191.wav	3.59	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_192.wav	2.90	The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_193.wav	2.39	It gave no further details.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_194.wav	3.03	Little is known about them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_195.wav	3.67	I won't make an official complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_196.wav	3.84	British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_197.wav	2.10	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_198.wav	3.97	Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_199.wav	2.56	His injury was completely random.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_200.wav	2.74	HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_201.wav	2.69	From there, they can go anywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_202.wav	2.35	I'm just a regular person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_203.wav	2.52	It had all been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_204.wav	2.61	The statement contained no surprises.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_205.wav	2.56	His third goal was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_206.wav	2.14	It will affect their work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_207.wav	2.52	I am considered a teenager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_208.wav	2.90	IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_209.wav	3.24	There's a chance they might come down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_210.wav	2.73	The transaction is not feasible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_211.wav	3.46	He remains a main board director of Royal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_212.wav	3.50	The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_213.wav	3.93	Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_214.wav	2.65	He later paid a tribute to his opponent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_216.wav	3.59	The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_217.wav	2.99	William Hague delighted his party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_218.wav	2.14	You could feel the heat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_219.wav	2.18	If it doesn't, it doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_220.wav	2.22	I have spoken to the skipper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_221.wav	2.52	That was a problem for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_222.wav	4.48	The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_223.wav	2.73	They would have to go to the Royal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_224.wav	3.16	But he failed to win the committee's support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_225.wav	2.39	He is obviously very dangerous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_226.wav	2.35	It depends on Labour, not on us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_227.wav	3.42	It had so much to do with the output.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_228.wav	2.39	We have not been approached.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_229.wav	3.12	The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_230.wav	2.10	I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_231.wav	3.38	That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_232.wav	2.99	Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_233.wav	3.80	Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_234.wav	2.22	The irony was not lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_235.wav	4.02	He said the move followed a downturn in business travel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_236.wav	3.03	My future is in the marathon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_237.wav	3.25	Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_238.wav	2.43	We were well worth the win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_239.wav	2.65	Kingfisher can afford to wait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_240.wav	2.60	In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_241.wav	3.12	Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_242.wav	2.52	You can feel at home in China.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_243.wav	2.05	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_244.wav	2.02	how do you get it back ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_245.wav	2.27	What are you not good at ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_246.wav	2.60	I think, therefore I am ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_247.wav	1.67	Who was she ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_248.wav	4.01	I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_249.wav	2.86	We have no information on Iraq.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_250.wav	3.50	Paterson can afford to be generous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_251.wav	2.90	Washington is consumed by the crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_252.wav	3.12	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_253.wav	2.39	It makes no difference to their friendship.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_254.wav	4.44	No production contract is yet in sight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_255.wav	2.82	It was the climax of the thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_256.wav	2.39	We accept the new rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_257.wav	2.60	On the contrary they stand to gain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_258.wav	2.01	It was a minor incident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_259.wav	3.46	Blair is very positive at European Councils.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_260.wav	2.22	He took over our lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_261.wav	3.80	I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_262.wav	2.39	I'd never run for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_263.wav	2.31	Her body has never been found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_264.wav	4.06	This will look at consumer attitudes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_265.wav	4.23	He could see no other bidder.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_266.wav	2.90	There's not much money in cycling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_267.wav	3.29	The demand is created by the supply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_268.wav	2.86	We're trying to get rounded performers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_269.wav	3.16	Any error is severely punished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_270.wav	3.97	Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_271.wav	3.76	Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_272.wav	1.88	It was a horrible moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_273.wav	2.26	Truth is the child of time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_274.wav	2.82	It was an easy decision to come here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_275.wav	3.41	Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_276.wav	3.20	Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_277.wav	1.96	It was never a free kick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_278.wav	3.16	They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_279.wav	2.65	This is a great opportunity for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_280.wav	4.35	We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_281.wav	3.12	She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_282.wav	3.03	You have to expect this type of thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_283.wav	3.33	In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_284.wav	4.01	It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_285.wav	3.59	Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_286.wav	2.82	The response from everyone was wonderful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_287.wav	4.22	There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_288.wav	3.07	The circumstances have changed since last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_289.wav	3.20	It's all designed to speed up the service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_290.wav	4.06	We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_291.wav	5.21	Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_292.wav	2.52	Tony Blair said as little.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_293.wav	1.33	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_294.wav	2.90	was everything done to save the people ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_295.wav	2.95	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_296.wav	2.82	Do I think about them often ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_297.wav	2.09	Is it in the right place ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_298.wav	2.86	The rescue package is public money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_299.wav	2.44	The effect was almost magical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_300.wav	3.76	I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_301.wav	2.60	And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_302.wav	2.82	Holland won by five wickets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_303.wav	2.78	His appeal is instantly understood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_304.wav	2.22	The songs are just so good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_305.wav	2.22	I can hardly believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_306.wav	2.73	Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_307.wav	3.54	Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_308.wav	2.44	The world record is suspicious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_309.wav	2.77	I was brought up in a mining background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_310.wav	2.91	I thought his speech was a disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_311.wav	3.12	Job losses were also announced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_312.wav	2.95	I had no intention of misleading anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_313.wav	2.48	The pound has also suffered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_314.wav	3.76	Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_316.wav	1.97	Scotland has shown the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_317.wav	3.63	You are talking about a matter of life and death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_318.wav	3.80	Leading share prices have also fallen in Paris and Frankfurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_319.wav	2.27	The letters are going out today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_320.wav	1.84	He will go a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_321.wav	2.52	We will listen to any suggestion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_322.wav	2.65	But it is a slow process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_323.wav	2.95	The woman is basically off her head.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_324.wav	3.20	Mr Clinton was asked about his memory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_325.wav	4.22	It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_326.wav	2.78	Other musicians were found in retirement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_327.wav	2.78	It is a terrible state of affairs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_328.wav	3.16	Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_329.wav	3.21	That is a trend which will be encouraged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_330.wav	2.82	They will have to cut through the roof.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_331.wav	2.52	The airport was even different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_332.wav	2.31	Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_333.wav	3.46	He declined to comment on possible disposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_334.wav	2.30	Nobody said it was required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_335.wav	2.86	It was tough to contain the excitement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_336.wav	3.97	Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_337.wav	2.48	Whether this return was too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_338.wav	4.01	Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_339.wav	1.75	It's wonderful to have won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_340.wav	2.43	He was at school in Devon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_341.wav	3.71	Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_342.wav	2.48	I'd like to take the plunge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_343.wav	2.95	I have a moral dilemma.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_344.wav	3.46	My view has now completely changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_345.wav	2.56	There was a definite prejudice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_346.wav	2.65	The strong pound also took its toll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_347.wav	2.78	We have very limited capacity.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_348.wav	2.91	Everything in golf is a balance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_349.wav	2.43	He can handle it without any problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_350.wav	4.57	The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_351.wav	3.16	The Allies intend to maintain the average.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_352.wav	3.08	My mind is focused on the next four weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_353.wav	2.69	We're still the only ones in the High Street.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_354.wav	2.48	He had no previous convictions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_355.wav	2.90	But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_356.wav	2.73	I was delighted to accept.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_357.wav	2.05	Do you think we are a top nation ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_358.wav	2.05	How independent is that ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_359.wav	1.97	Are they free ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_360.wav	2.61	Is there a waiting list ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_361.wav	3.25	George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_362.wav	3.97	But BA said the prediction was premature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_363.wav	2.65	They should take their mobile phones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_364.wav	2.35	They have broken that promise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_365.wav	2.35	That is a crazy situation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_366.wav	1.88	We are really good friends.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_367.wav	3.12	From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_368.wav	3.33	Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_369.wav	5.63	The statement finally came on Wednesday night after the market had closed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_370.wav	2.39	The salary changes are long overdue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_371.wav	4.05	The major championships will always have a special place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_372.wav	3.37	They were to blame for the first two goals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_373.wav	2.10	There is no deal as yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_374.wav	3.59	Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_375.wav	3.03	This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_376.wav	3.46	It was like a weekly wage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_377.wav	2.65	In due course the deal was done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_378.wav	2.52	to have products for their needs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_379.wav	2.52	The pair are very much in love.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_380.wav	2.39	We will win the argument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_381.wav	4.14	The prosecution say the girl was the only witness to the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_382.wav	2.48	It benefits the whole family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_383.wav	4.91	Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_384.wav	3.20	It runs until the beginning of June.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_385.wav	2.52	Theatre is not a museum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_386.wav	3.84	The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_387.wav	2.56	We are satisfied with this outcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_388.wav	2.82	We operate as a Scottish company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_389.wav	4.14	They have not done so this season so far.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_390.wav	2.44	Rugby is a hard game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_391.wav	2.18	Is it worth it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_392.wav	1.67	Does it matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_393.wav	2.73	How do you take them away ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_394.wav	3.85	However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_395.wav	2.01	After the match, do you ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_396.wav	3.12	He put some colour into Scottish history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_397.wav	2.95	This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_398.wav	3.16	The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_399.wav	2.31	Clark is back on top form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_400.wav	2.69	The results will take second place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_401.wav	1.84	It was a funny game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_402.wav	1.96	It's too close to call.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_403.wav	2.05	It is a large number.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_404.wav	2.22	She started to put on weight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_405.wav	2.09	I've had a wonderful career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_406.wav	4.01	Upgrading the station has been under consideration for some time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_407.wav	2.22	But the foundations have been laid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_408.wav	2.77	There was an element of frustration.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_409.wav	2.22	Russell is delighted with them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_410.wav	3.50	We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_411.wav	2.95	We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_412.wav	3.24	George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_413.wav	2.48	I remain a buyer of the shares.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_414.wav	3.42	I would like to continue to develop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_415.wav	3.63	Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_416.wav	3.16	This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_417.wav	2.35	There is a solution, she believes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_418.wav	2.52	That might mean another delay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_419.wav	1.96	That's been all around Europe with me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_420.wav	3.16	She's had to suffer for the last six years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_421.wav	3.46	The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_422.wav	2.35	My aim is a top six finish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_423.wav	2.69	That means that nobody can do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_424.wav	2.52	Such an attack is bizarre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_425.wav	3.25	At half-time he was presented to both teams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_426.wav	2.86	No date has been fixed for his return.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_427.wav	2.22	It was a breathtaking moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_428.wav	3.16	Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_429.wav	3.97	A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_430.wav	2.69	No-one wanted to run it tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_431.wav	2.18	They are not left wing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_432.wav	2.43	It is not a standing army.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_433.wav	2.82	Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_434.wav	3.25	The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_435.wav	2.90	Their condition is described as satisfactory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p273\p273_436.wav	5.12	He confirmed the coaching structure was already under review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_002.wav	4.14	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_003.wav	7.81	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_004.wav	5.55	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_005.wav	7.22	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_006.wav	6.19	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_007.wav	4.91	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_008.wav	8.49	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_009.wav	5.17	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_010.wav	3.38	People look, but no one ever finds it. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_011.wav	8.02	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_012.wav	4.99	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_013.wav	4.91	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_014.wav	5.34	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_015.wav	6.27	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_016.wav	6.96	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_017.wav	4.27	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_018.wav	6.27	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_019.wav	7.94	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_020.wav	4.27	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_021.wav	10.54	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_022.wav	8.19	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_023.wav	12.08	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. )
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_024.wav	7.47	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_025.wav	3.12	I can't play the game for them.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_026.wav	3.80	She is employed on short-term contracts.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_027.wav	2.73	Drugs are a serious problem.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_028.wav	2.82	This is a central issue.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_029.wav	2.86	Not if you know the person.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_030.wav	3.97	Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_031.wav	4.74	Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_032.wav	3.71	Costs have got to be controlled.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_033.wav	3.63	You must always attempt to raise the bar.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_034.wav	3.46	Several investments have already been made.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_035.wav	4.95	This represents a tough game for us.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_036.wav	3.54	The boy is no longer with us.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_037.wav	2.91	They said she was stable.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_038.wav	2.78	Among them are many criminals.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_039.wav	3.37	Merger would be entirely logical.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_040.wav	2.73	Well, he is an artist.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_041.wav	2.69	He looks like an Afghan.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_042.wav	2.99	Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_043.wav	2.73	He will need that machine.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_044.wav	3.29	People want to see me on the screen.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_045.wav	2.65	I had come back from London.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_046.wav	3.33	Pulled a huge number of viewers.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_047.wav	2.82	I had trouble with the producers.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_048.wav	3.38	Subsidy income will not be affected.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_049.wav	3.63	We are certainly talking about many millions.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_050.wav	3.84	The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_051.wav	3.84	The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_052.wav	3.12	The latter were not from Scotland.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_053.wav	2.86	We felt it was sufficient.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_054.wav	3.03	There's still plenty time left.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_055.wav	4.69	The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_056.wav	4.82	Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_057.wav	3.29	He's not getting into any games.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_058.wav	2.78	We will pay their bills.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_059.wav	3.50	Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_060.wav	3.25	He hadn't had them for a long time.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_061.wav	3.37	Only water is currently allowed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_062.wav	3.41	It's not covered by the insurance.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_063.wav	3.24	We need to increase the membership.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_064.wav	2.52	There could be a way back.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_065.wav	2.82	Then followed a bout of flu.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_066.wav	2.78	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_067.wav	2.43	How are you, sir ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_068.wav	2.90	So is that it, then ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_069.wav	2.52	Do I have a favourite ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_070.wav	1.97	What do we do ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_071.wav	2.09	Why do it otherwise ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_072.wav	3.33	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_073.wav	4.65	Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_074.wav	3.97	I want the Commonwealth and European titles.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_075.wav	3.46	Talk of a crisis is absurd.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_076.wav	4.69	After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_077.wav	3.33	There may be reasons for it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_078.wav	4.02	I first met him last summer.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_079.wav	3.84	It is the only company of its kind in the UK.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_080.wav	3.84	The ethos of the school was outstanding.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_081.wav	3.29	It took an option on the process.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_082.wav	3.20	We have to offer value for money.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_083.wav	2.65	Our mother is very worried.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_084.wav	2.77	They lived for their children.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_085.wav	3.03	It wasn't possible to relax.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_086.wav	3.71	This is a complex and detailed report.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_087.wav	2.57	Tony Blair said as little.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_088.wav	6.23	The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_089.wav	3.80	The processing plant was closed yesterday.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_090.wav	5.85	I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_091.wav	3.63	That will bring about a dramatic improvement.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_092.wav	2.61	It was clear on Thursday.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_093.wav	3.42	It was a family tragedy.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_094.wav	3.08	He is not a dancer.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_095.wav	4.78	It is for policy Ministers to defend their policies.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_096.wav	3.54	In the end we made too many errors.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_097.wav	3.46	The following are the principal provisions.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_098.wav	3.42	I did not concentrate on my performance.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_099.wav	4.87	But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_100.wav	3.12	Before the game we went for a pint.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_101.wav	2.82	Our house was very small.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_102.wav	3.03	I did not think about the Ryder Cup.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_103.wav	3.03	I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_104.wav	4.36	While they went on holiday, we got the contract.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_105.wav	4.61	According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_106.wav	3.97	Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_107.wav	3.12	We deserve a significant rise.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_108.wav	3.08	Here the jury is still out.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_109.wav	5.64	This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_110.wav	3.16	We have a team to reach the final.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_111.wav	3.11	You can spend money on housing.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_112.wav	2.86	It's not a quick fix.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_113.wav	3.54	Structural changes were also required.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_114.wav	3.33	It was a good game to watch.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_115.wav	3.08	However, the problem is the timing.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_116.wav	2.86	Which can happen any time.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_117.wav	3.29	We had another last Tuesday.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_118.wav	2.90	This should begin in October.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_119.wav	2.26	I was on a roll.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_120.wav	4.27	There is no evidence that these people are helpful.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_121.wav	2.74	That is far too high.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_122.wav	3.29	He said to give a local injection.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_123.wav	2.65	What happened in that game ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_124.wav	2.43	Are you going to win ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_125.wav	2.52	Was it the wife ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_126.wav	2.05	Why change it ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_127.wav	2.65	What do we want to do that for ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_128.wav	2.48	Does the name matter ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_129.wav	2.69	how do you get it back ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_130.wav	3.84	That would open the gates of hell.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_131.wav	4.78	The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_132.wav	3.07	I feel very grateful with everything.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_133.wav	3.84	Ms McNeill was killed on impact.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_134.wav	2.82	This is a major championship.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_135.wav	2.95	I love the spectacle of cinema.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_136.wav	4.23	This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_137.wav	3.12	It's going to take some time.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_138.wav	3.29	I think he's the favourite, no question.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_139.wav	2.56	It is a vicious circle.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_140.wav	3.38	The BBC was a disgrace.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_141.wav	2.65	But she was very human.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_142.wav	3.33	The referee faces a massive job.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_143.wav	4.82	Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_144.wav	3.03	There is no mandate for a regime change.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_145.wav	5.12	No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_146.wav	3.07	The whole industry is a shambles.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_147.wav	2.86	We have to speed up the process.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_148.wav	3.20	There's only one team in Ayrshire.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_149.wav	3.29	I prefer the clarity of the existing system.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_150.wav	4.70	The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_151.wav	3.67	It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_152.wav	3.03	It was by the numbers.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_153.wav	2.65	And sooner than we may think.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_154.wav	3.46	The abuse of elderly people was appalling.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_155.wav	2.73	The danger is always there.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_156.wav	3.67	Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_157.wav	2.99	They should stop the bombing.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_158.wav	3.54	Scotland came very close in the second Test.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_159.wav	3.76	Full back was a bit of the unknown.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_160.wav	4.10	The strong performance is expected to continue.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_161.wav	2.48	He was in great spirits.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_162.wav	3.55	We came across the first set of bodies.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_163.wav	3.88	Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_164.wav	3.12	But it is different in different regions.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_165.wav	3.63	Further growth will be funded from cash flow.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_166.wav	2.90	They had been forced to walk.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_167.wav	3.93	The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_168.wav	2.39	It's not good at all.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_169.wav	4.74	You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_170.wav	3.80	But the petrol station does not get the benefit.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_171.wav	4.02	If that's the case, he will struggle.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_173.wav	3.16	I'm just going to hit the shot.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_174.wav	4.23	Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_175.wav	4.82	They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_176.wav	2.61	Says the Duke of York.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_177.wav	3.25	And they were being paid ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_178.wav	3.25	was everything done to save people ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_179.wav	3.50	What was the matter for concern ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_180.wav	2.91	Do I think about them often ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_181.wav	3.21	Is it in the right place ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_182.wav	2.14	Did he trip ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_183.wav	3.42	They bought the property four years ago.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_184.wav	2.82	Miller was every bit as happy.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_185.wav	3.85	Women were mostly notable by their absence.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_186.wav	3.88	They responded well after the run of defeats.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_187.wav	3.29	It could be done by experts and lawyers.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_188.wav	3.50	The interim dividend has been passed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_189.wav	2.82	But there's an upturn in the sector.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_190.wav	2.77	Aberdeen had little to offer.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_191.wav	4.86	It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_192.wav	3.08	I'm interested in interesting work.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_193.wav	3.71	We represent a wide range of society.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_194.wav	5.81	Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_195.wav	3.41	It's very difficult to find a buyer.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_196.wav	3.84	Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_197.wav	4.23	But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_198.wav	3.50	Everyone can have their opinion.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_199.wav	3.03	He should emerge as the winner.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_200.wav	3.46	It comes from reflection or thinking.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_201.wav	3.03	That might mean another delay.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_202.wav	3.80	The early physical reports were clear.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_203.wav	3.03	If it doesn't, it doesn't.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_204.wav	2.86	The result is utterly compelling.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_205.wav	4.57	The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_206.wav	3.37	I won't make an official complaint.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_207.wav	2.18	It was worth a photograph.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_208.wav	2.95	Which isn't a bad idea.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_209.wav	3.12	We have an election in eight days.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_210.wav	4.78	Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_211.wav	2.78	They have known the hard times.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_212.wav	3.42	Today we must not repeat that mistake.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_213.wav	3.59	It's easy to be negative about these things.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_214.wav	3.08	Basically, they have to come up with the offer.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_215.wav	2.99	I am considered a teenager.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_216.wav	3.33	However, Dundee deserved to win this game.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_217.wav	4.02	That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_218.wav	2.44	It was a crazy day.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_219.wav	2.86	People should make their own decisions.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_220.wav	3.67	The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_221.wav	2.95	The red card was okay.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_222.wav	3.63	It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_223.wav	2.91	Laura is an investment banker.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_224.wav	3.08	We have not given up hope.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_225.wav	3.89	Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_226.wav	3.33	William Hague delighted his party.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_227.wav	2.86	We played them off the pitch.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_228.wav	4.44	The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_229.wav	5.38	The output price index in December was unchanged on November.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_230.wav	3.25	The performance continues to improve.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_231.wav	4.27	A small number of new jobs will also be created.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_232.wav	5.29	They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_233.wav	3.67	He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_234.wav	3.63	It depends on Labour, not on us.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_235.wav	3.67	Paterson can afford to be generous.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_236.wav	2.56	Wilson will tell the truth.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_237.wav	4.19	The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_238.wav	4.10	Customers would then be consulted over any changes.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_239.wav	3.67	Those overseas offices were great.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_240.wav	2.69	You will have seen the adverts.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_241.wav	3.84	Half of young people had had contact with the police.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_242.wav	2.69	It will now be revived.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_243.wav	3.03	I was released after six days.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_244.wav	3.33	Three weeks later, he resigned.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_245.wav	2.73	Others agreed with this view.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_246.wav	2.18	I was just a kid.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_247.wav	3.37	There were no reports of casualties.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_248.wav	5.12	Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_249.wav	2.56	The effects are not all bad.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_250.wav	2.73	He would not impose a fine.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_251.wav	2.77	Does that put pressure on us ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_252.wav	2.18	Did it work ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_253.wav	3.25	Do you think we are a top nation ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_254.wav	2.39	Is our children learning ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_255.wav	2.94	How independent is that ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_256.wav	2.60	What form did that take ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_257.wav	4.57	Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_258.wav	3.67	Kingfisher can afford to wait.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_259.wav	4.65	A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_260.wav	3.03	Labour was too busy to respond.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_261.wav	2.95	You can feel at home in China.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_262.wav	2.44	He will go a long way.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_263.wav	3.16	We have no information on Iraq.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_264.wav	3.76	Either way, the investor retains the premium.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_266.wav	4.70	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_267.wav	2.61	I should think so, too.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_268.wav	3.41	This will save interest charges.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_269.wav	4.10	No production contract is yet in sight.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_270.wav	4.02	Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_271.wav	4.06	He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_272.wav	4.31	This idea has been around for four years.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_273.wav	5.21	The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_274.wav	3.46	We accept the new rules.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_275.wav	2.86	He is quite well organised.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_276.wav	3.08	I couldn't honestly tell you.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_277.wav	3.55	On the contrary they stand to gain.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_278.wav	3.67	Quality was high in all sections.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_279.wav	3.50	He took over our lives.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_280.wav	4.27	I rejected the idea of a separate residence.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_281.wav	3.54	This will look at consumer attitudes.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_282.wav	2.82	It is also very valuable.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_283.wav	3.50	There's not much money in cycling.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_284.wav	4.49	My main intention was to write a funny comedy.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_285.wav	3.63	None of this work is guaranteed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_286.wav	4.61	Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_287.wav	4.40	It has raised the profile of Scottish banking.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_288.wav	3.21	They can leave at any time.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_289.wav	3.84	It opens the door to the Champions League.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_290.wav	4.01	It has the potential to be another North Sea.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_291.wav	4.31	Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_292.wav	3.97	Frankly, we should all have such problems.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_293.wav	2.77	And Michael was just great.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_294.wav	3.54	Strikers like to go to the ground.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_295.wav	3.25	This is a great opportunity for us.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_296.wav	5.46	We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_297.wav	3.76	It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_298.wav	3.97	You have to expect this type of thing.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_299.wav	3.54	It is a flexible concept.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_300.wav	4.22	The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_301.wav	2.86	And we were very lucky.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_302.wav	3.08	So the Government will be damaged.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_303.wav	3.93	The partnership was set up during the summer.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_304.wav	2.95	There's nothing I can say.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_305.wav	3.67	Her body was found on Monday morning.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_306.wav	3.08	We will deliver at director level.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_307.wav	4.70	They have shown a great desire and attitude.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_308.wav	3.55	I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_309.wav	3.12	Maloney is an engaging talent.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_310.wav	3.08	The rescue package is public money.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_311.wav	3.33	Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_312.wav	3.16	Everything in golf is a balance.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_313.wav	3.41	The weather will be unpredictable if anything.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_314.wav	3.33	His appeal is instantly understood.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_315.wav	2.77	The songs are just so good.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_316.wav	4.40	Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_317.wav	3.50	Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_318.wav	4.78	Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_319.wav	3.20	McNaughton was not so sure.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_320.wav	2.35	Are they free ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_321.wav	2.26	What are they for ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_322.wav	2.48	Is there a waiting list ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_323.wav	3.12	Do they think anyone else wants them ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_324.wav	3.16	So what happens next ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_325.wav	3.20	Had this been common practice ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_326.wav	2.78	What do they want us to do ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_327.wav	1.97	Is it worth it ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_328.wav	2.73	There was no hint of scandal.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_329.wav	3.42	I was brought up in a mining background.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_330.wav	2.95	We're not an employment agency.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_331.wav	3.24	She had gone to the Catholic school.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_332.wav	4.14	But I have been told that rugby playing numbers are up again.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_333.wav	2.86	The group is not paying a dividend.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_334.wav	5.03	Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_335.wav	2.69	He has left the company.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_336.wav	2.65	And he goes with it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_337.wav	3.29	There will be good prospects ahead.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_338.wav	2.43	It is a court case.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_339.wav	3.97	There is a handful of rewarding paintings.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_340.wav	3.12	This is a historic occasion.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_341.wav	3.03	Writing has diminished in value.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_342.wav	2.56	That's the way it goes.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_343.wav	3.21	After some discussion they did.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_344.wav	2.82	No one wants a dispute.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_345.wav	3.59	Our season is not finished.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_346.wav	5.12	Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_347.wav	3.89	The business model is actually very exciting.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_348.wav	2.99	There was some merit in that.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_349.wav	3.46	That is a trend which will be encouraged.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_350.wav	2.95	Other people had looked at it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_351.wav	4.14	He declined to comment on possible disposals.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_352.wav	4.06	It was tough to contain the excitement.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_353.wav	2.74	Either team will be hard.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_354.wav	3.07	The pain is still acute.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_355.wav	5.38	Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_356.wav	3.08	It's wonderful to have won.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_357.wav	3.93	This might seem like an outrageous assertion.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_358.wav	3.63	Governments will have to respond.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_359.wav	3.33	We have very limited capacity.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_360.wav	5.00	It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_361.wav	4.53	It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_362.wav	3.11	We are in a global market.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_363.wav	3.76	The Allies intend to maintain the average.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_364.wav	3.41	Italy was just behind the US.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_365.wav	2.90	It was a unanimous decision.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_366.wav	2.78	Do not forget about Monaco.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_367.wav	3.08	He had no previous convictions.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_368.wav	3.55	But the Foreign Secretary can cope.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_369.wav	2.56	I got a yellow card.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_370.wav	1.80	Does it matter ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_371.wav	2.69	How do you take them away ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_372.wav	3.54	However, there is an issue, isn't there ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_373.wav	2.52	After the match, do you ?)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_374.wav	3.37	It had been a magical moment.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_375.wav	3.89	From our point of view, the player is free to leave.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_376.wav	3.72	Yesterday was a statement of intent.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_377.wav	3.25	Those people must be accountable.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_378.wav	5.46	Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_379.wav	4.40	Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_380.wav	3.93	Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_381.wav	3.29	This hasn't happened in a vacuum.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_382.wav	4.40	Both of those promises have already been honoured.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_383.wav	3.03	It was like a weekly wage.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_384.wav	4.23	In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_385.wav	3.37	It will be completed within a year.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_386.wav	3.24	The pair are very much in love.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_387.wav	3.76	Everything is now in place for Manchester.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_388.wav	4.40	The group will also become an Internet service provider.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_389.wav	4.14	Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_390.wav	3.97	Glasgow University declined to comment.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_391.wav	3.67	It runs until the beginning of June.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_392.wav	3.71	He has earned the right to their respect.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_393.wav	3.59	The law would appear to be on our side.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_394.wav	3.63	The board meetings will be held in Edinburgh.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_396.wav	4.06	There was a substantial explosion.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_397.wav	3.33	It's never great to finish second.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_398.wav	3.07	Finally, he paid for the movie.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_399.wav	5.00	The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_400.wav	3.16	It has only been rumours.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_401.wav	4.06	He put some colour into Scottish history.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_402.wav	3.07	Clark is back on top form.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_403.wav	3.07	We're not taking any risks.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_404.wav	2.95	Neither man has been charged.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_405.wav	3.20	The members have voted against it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_406.wav	3.20	It's too close to call.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_407.wav	3.37	Nobody will be forced to work.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_408.wav	4.14	I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_409.wav	5.16	I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_410.wav	3.07	I've had a wonderful career.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_411.wav	4.40	However, the players should have a voice in these matters.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_412.wav	5.08	Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_413.wav	3.54	But the foundations have been laid.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_414.wav	2.90	That is the ultimate revenge.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_415.wav	2.86	It's just a training thing.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_416.wav	3.63	A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_417.wav	3.80	They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_418.wav	3.97	George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_419.wav	2.91	The second goal was superb.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_420.wav	3.89	Hopefully, the answer is in the positive.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_421.wav	3.12	I was pleased with my own game.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_422.wav	4.61	This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_423.wav	3.93	This should put downward pressure on inflation.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_424.wav	4.61	Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_425.wav	4.40	The projections are very positive for South Africa.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_426.wav	3.55	Being captain of this club is fantastic.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_427.wav	3.16	Such an attack is bizarre.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_428.wav	3.16	It needs to be volatile.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_429.wav	2.78	I never had a childhood.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_430.wav	5.04	The need for any new UN resolutions will be put on hold.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_431.wav	5.08	A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_432.wav	2.99	The trial will open today.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_433.wav	3.55	There is another important factor.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_434.wav	3.29	This is a limited market.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_435.wav	3.29	Its failure is no surprise.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_436.wav	3.63	No doubt the council would welcome the proposal.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_437.wav	3.50	The Festival is prepared to help.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_438.wav	3.50	Strangely enough I felt very sharp.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_439.wav	3.20	His message was very simple.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_440.wav	4.27	The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_441.wav	2.86	I didn't get to keep it.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_442.wav	3.72	Their condition is described as satisfactory.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_443.wav	5.46	Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_444.wav	4.14	They are interior designers and architects.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_445.wav	5.42	Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_446.wav	2.86	It wouldn't matter if he had.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_447.wav	4.57	No further details of expansion plans were given.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_448.wav	4.10	The villagers were shot in the head at short range.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_449.wav	2.78	It is pretty bad news.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_450.wav	4.31	We just thought it would be kept under the carpet.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_451.wav	3.50	It could cause a little bit of disruption.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_452.wav	4.18	But we have built a platform for next season.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_453.wav	3.37	I think the goalkeeper should have gone.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_454.wav	3.54	We think a lot of Allan McGregor.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_455.wav	3.25	It was like someone had died.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_456.wav	3.29	They offer a kind of narrative.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_457.wav	3.63	We're still the only ones in the High Street.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_458.wav	3.80	A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_459.wav	3.24	Now that business is banned.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_460.wav	3.46	Let that be their memorial.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_461.wav	2.86	The boys are mentally focused.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_462.wav	2.91	Driving has been the key.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_463.wav	3.72	It's because they can't understand the language.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_464.wav	4.22	Then came the farewell to Europe.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_465.wav	5.38	The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_466.wav	3.07	Phil Mickelson did that last year.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_467.wav	3.50	The answer was up there on the stage.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_468.wav	4.69	It recommended that they reject the proposed legislation.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_469.wav	3.76	He will not be involved in school discipline.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p274\p274_470.wav	4.95	You have to have a proven track record to get them.)
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_001.wav	2.18	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_002.wav	3.72	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_003.wav	7.34	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_004.wav	4.74	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_006.wav	6.15	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_007.wav	4.44	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_008.wav	7.00	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_009.wav	5.08	There is , according to the legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_010.wav	2.95	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_011.wav	7.04	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_012.wav	5.04	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_013.wav	4.36	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_014.wav	4.82	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_015.wav	5.42	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_016.wav	7.13	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_017.wav	4.14	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_018.wav	5.30	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_019.wav	7.51	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_020.wav	4.65	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_022.wav	6.83	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_023.wav	11.65	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_024.wav	6.53	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_025.wav	2.01	But it failed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_026.wav	4.18	Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_027.wav	3.33	We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_028.wav	4.70	Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_029.wav	3.54	Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_030.wav	4.78	They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_031.wav	2.56	There's a story, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_032.wav	2.39	He was jailed for four years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_033.wav	4.06	We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_034.wav	2.86	Then, suddenly, they weren't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_035.wav	4.27	Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_036.wav	3.16	However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_037.wav	2.48	They're just different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_038.wav	4.57	Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_039.wav	2.35	Indeed, he does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_040.wav	2.52	Sadly, it can't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_041.wav	2.43	Dancing was her life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_042.wav	4.31	It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_043.wav	2.27	We will push.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_044.wav	4.10	The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_045.wav	2.78	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_046.wav	4.10	Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_047.wav	2.86	Among them are many criminals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_048.wav	3.93	Every aspect of our play was first class.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_049.wav	2.60	He looks like an Afghan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_050.wav	2.01	Here's a clue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_051.wav	3.33	I had come back from London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_052.wav	5.16	Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_053.wav	1.92	It is unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_054.wav	1.97	That's the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_055.wav	1.88	There's a danger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_056.wav	3.50	We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_057.wav	3.89	The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_058.wav	5.42	George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_059.wav	2.39	This is the first step.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_060.wav	2.77	It's good news and long overdue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_061.wav	2.48	And if he hadn't become a musician?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_062.wav	4.06	There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_063.wav	3.84	I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_064.wav	3.03	Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_065.wav	1.88	Try to save us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_066.wav	3.50	He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_067.wav	2.86	Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_068.wav	3.67	Strathclyde police had appealed for witnesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_069.wav	2.52	He was at home with his pals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_070.wav	2.30	It's all I can do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_071.wav	2.22	There could be a way back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_072.wav	3.29	I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_073.wav	1.97	It works for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_074.wav	2.48	The party is up for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_075.wav	4.05	The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_076.wav	4.23	Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_077.wav	1.75	I will miss him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_078.wav	2.18	A review is under way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_079.wav	2.61	He had suffered a heart attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_080.wav	1.75	He is driven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_081.wav	3.41	He seems to be pleased with the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_082.wav	3.12	Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_083.wav	2.27	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_084.wav	4.06	The city council is a major property owner in the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_085.wav	3.12	Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_086.wav	2.52	It is a lifeline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_087.wav	3.72	They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_088.wav	3.46	This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_089.wav	4.91	I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_090.wav	1.71	But I was wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_091.wav	2.09	I saw the whole thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_092.wav	4.14	Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_093.wav	2.14	Hartley should know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_094.wav	2.26	It is a love affair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_095.wav	3.25	May not have been at fault?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_096.wav	6.49	Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_097.wav	4.40	We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_098.wav	4.57	There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_099.wav	2.73	Oil embargo endorsed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_100.wav	2.77	There were no grounds for his action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_101.wav	2.01	He takes the job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_102.wav	2.18	She reflects a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_103.wav	5.08	Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped him form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_104.wav	6.02	Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_105.wav	4.53	It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_106.wav	3.16	While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_108.wav	3.46	He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_109.wav	2.14	It's a shame.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_110.wav	2.78	It was the eighties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_111.wav	2.52	It is a financial matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_112.wav	2.31	It is so sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_113.wav	4.31	Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_114.wav	1.92	The mood is upbeat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_115.wav	3.42	In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_116.wav	2.10	It's not fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_117.wav	3.89	We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_118.wav	2.01	It is rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_119.wav	2.69	Who would be a referee?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_120.wav	4.53	That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_121.wav	3.93	There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_122.wav	1.96	Who would have?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_123.wav	1.96	That's all right then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_124.wav	2.95	I wouldn't have wanted any other way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_125.wav	5.63	It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_126.wav	2.43	She really suffered for her art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_127.wav	2.52	It is not a U-turn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_128.wav	3.07	Offered the gold medal, he declined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_129.wav	1.92	Who will attend?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_130.wav	2.48	Twaddle is a case in point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_131.wav	2.65	The BBC was a disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_132.wav	2.14	I am now unemployed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_133.wav	3.42	She said she would not welcome the flowers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_134.wav	2.65	It plans to return to this field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_135.wav	2.13	What will happen then?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_136.wav	1.62	It's not true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_137.wav	3.25	Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_138.wav	3.67	Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_139.wav	3.24	It was very frightened and dirty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_140.wav	4.40	We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_141.wav	2.01	Is that it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_142.wav	4.27	If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_143.wav	3.80	It seems so long since I did the exams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_144.wav	4.23	On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_145.wav	1.88	Who would be right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_146.wav	3.97	No-one in Downing Street can speak the language of the unions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_147.wav	2.39	He realises his mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_148.wav	4.35	Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_149.wav	2.05	I was awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_150.wav	3.37	We have the location, which is assured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_151.wav	4.74	He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_152.wav	4.86	Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_153.wav	2.91	I am just trying to do my job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_154.wav	2.14	So I got a blood test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_155.wav	4.14	It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_156.wav	4.05	But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_157.wav	2.82	The weather forecast isn't good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_158.wav	3.97	It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_159.wav	3.16	They have not been named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_160.wav	2.82	We also enjoyed a lot of support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_161.wav	2.52	It was by the numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_162.wav	4.23	She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_163.wav	4.44	For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_164.wav	3.59	This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_165.wav	2.39	Well, he should know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_166.wav	2.86	Was this element always there?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_167.wav	2.95	These days are long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_168.wav	2.82	I was in the train station overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_169.wav	2.31	We've all had the shots.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_170.wav	2.48	Tell it like it was?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_171.wav	3.80	Seven people were later detained by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_172.wav	3.80	Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_173.wav	2.65	You had to go and see him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_174.wav	2.14	In a way he was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_175.wav	2.91	One season, they might do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_176.wav	2.43	Is Saddam a threat?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_177.wav	2.18	As we worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_178.wav	4.18	However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_179.wav	4.01	It is not either national standards or local control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_180.wav	2.31	He deserved the win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_181.wav	4.95	In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_182.wav	2.05	Tony had arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_183.wav	4.06	The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_184.wav	4.91	Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_185.wav	2.22	His name was unknown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_186.wav	2.09	It's an idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_187.wav	4.53	Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_188.wav	2.39	Four policemen were wounded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_189.wav	2.99	I saw military vehicles in the distance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_190.wav	2.91	What has caused the demise of singing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_191.wav	3.37	Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_192.wav	2.05	It is a farce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_193.wav	2.05	Peace was won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_194.wav	3.97	It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_195.wav	2.60	Yet the data is compelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_196.wav	2.73	I came home by ambulance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_197.wav	4.10	The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_198.wav	1.93	I have a cold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_199.wav	4.44	On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_200.wav	2.22	Tommy is not a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_201.wav	2.10	Who will pay for this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_203.wav	2.31	But she might be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_205.wav	4.87	Some realism was needed about the time, resources and management.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_207.wav	2.30	I don't want to use it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_208.wav	2.22	Feel the heat?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_209.wav	2.05	He knows a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_210.wav	1.92	You have a plan?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_211.wav	4.44	We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_212.wav	3.33	It had all been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_213.wav	3.29	So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_214.wav	3.72	IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_215.wav	2.48	He seemed to lose his focus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_216.wav	2.31	Work has started.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_217.wav	5.08	The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_218.wav	4.87	The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_219.wav	3.37	He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_220.wav	3.25	Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_221.wav	3.71	During the communist time they were very privileged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_222.wav	2.95	We could easily be cut again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_223.wav	1.93	Saturday is gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_224.wav	1.75	It's the Tate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_225.wav	2.44	Clearly, the stakes are high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_226.wav	1.45	I will win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_227.wav	2.27	The report is due out next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_228.wav	3.76	I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_229.wav	1.92	He is in the queue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_230.wav	3.16	My wife and family are the support system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_231.wav	3.93	Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_233.wav	3.59	The parties have been given until today to respond.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_234.wav	1.92	Of course I was tempted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_235.wav	3.16	We will treat it like a World Cup match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_236.wav	3.76	It would still have been a good film, but very different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_237.wav	3.76	The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_238.wav	4.10	He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_239.wav	2.69	In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_240.wav	2.30	It is hard won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_241.wav	2.18	Our policy is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_242.wav	3.93	It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_243.wav	4.10	I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_244.wav	3.89	I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_246.wav	3.37	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_247.wav	1.92	It was a hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_248.wav	4.10	The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_249.wav	2.35	I can't get a job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_250.wav	4.40	For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_251.wav	2.05	Kirkwood was arrested.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_252.wav	4.57	Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_253.wav	3.46	It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_254.wav	4.48	One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_255.wav	2.43	Is that a serious question?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_256.wav	4.48	Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_257.wav	4.10	This court has made an order which has not been observed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_258.wav	2.82	Souter will be back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_259.wav	2.61	Blood samples were taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_260.wav	2.65	They want to shut the Scottish Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_261.wav	3.12	It will be done in stages.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_262.wav	2.65	This is a question of Islam.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_263.wav	4.57	That review will look at the management across the sector as a whole.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_264.wav	4.06	Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_265.wav	1.92	It's very nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_266.wav	3.93	It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_268.wav	3.50	She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_269.wav	4.66	The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_270.wav	2.43	It was very fast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_271.wav	3.46	In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_272.wav	4.78	His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_273.wav	3.97	In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_274.wav	2.09	It's so awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_275.wav	3.88	It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_276.wav	2.95	We are a grandmother.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_277.wav	2.27	He looked very sharp.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_278.wav	4.05	There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_279.wav	4.31	Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_280.wav	3.89	This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_281.wav	3.93	You've got to have both sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_282.wav	2.26	It was a virus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_283.wav	2.09	Yet, it worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_284.wav	4.35	The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_285.wav	1.88	It was good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_286.wav	2.69	Who did the recruiting?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_287.wav	3.97	Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_288.wav	3.37	Bombing slaughter rejected
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_289.wav	2.69	We are not going to forget.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_290.wav	2.39	I could never be cool.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_291.wav	2.18	Who can predict?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_292.wav	2.30	There was a vacuum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_293.wav	4.44	I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_294.wav	4.01	That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_295.wav	2.99	The tournament has now been cancelled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_296.wav	2.44	She is really magic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_297.wav	2.14	One was a lawyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_298.wav	4.27	A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_299.wav	2.73	There were no passengers on board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_300.wav	1.79	It could work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_301.wav	2.65	This is a war over our home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_302.wav	4.40	In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_303.wav	3.07	The court had a number of empty seats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_304.wav	4.61	The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_305.wav	2.43	The plot is minimal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_306.wav	4.78	They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_307.wav	2.91	There's no evidence he was ever there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_308.wav	2.14	You should be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_309.wav	2.48	The minister is the engineer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_310.wav	2.69	The letters are going out today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_311.wav	4.23	I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_312.wav	3.08	We have got no money to go anywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_313.wav	3.16	The Premier League has been a huge success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_314.wav	3.07	We have got to get the points from this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_315.wav	2.61	My whole life has changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_316.wav	3.12	The election is total confusion and chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_317.wav	2.05	Kids are terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_320.wav	2.30	We are in the end game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_321.wav	2.90	Our message was inclusive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_322.wav	2.22	Off with their heads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_323.wav	3.03	The figures are bad, but not that bad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_324.wav	2.90	My view has now completely changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_325.wav	3.12	Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_326.wav	2.01	Is that an issue?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_327.wav	3.50	Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_328.wav	2.39	Finally, he paid for the movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_329.wav	3.37	You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_330.wav	1.75	It's been hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_331.wav	3.29	Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_332.wav	2.14	Who will do it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_333.wav	3.67	I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_334.wav	3.59	That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_335.wav	4.44	He also insisted that no concession had been made to the French.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_336.wav	3.50	In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_337.wav	2.82	We are the gateway to justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_338.wav	4.35	In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_339.wav	4.06	Yet, for the money, he was not the man of the match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_340.wav	2.56	This is a friendly match?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_341.wav	2.31	I got a yellow card.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_342.wav	3.80	The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_343.wav	2.35	Tell us about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_344.wav	2.82	There may be reasons for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_345.wav	2.69	I believe the gap is nearly there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_346.wav	3.85	He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_347.wav	4.48	Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_348.wav	5.08	A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_349.wav	1.67	She is free.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_350.wav	2.82	Both of those promises have already been honoured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_351.wav	4.27	Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_352.wav	2.56	The pair are very much in love.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_353.wav	1.92	It is not like us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_354.wav	3.55	Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_355.wav	4.14	To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_356.wav	2.39	We will be homeless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_357.wav	1.92	That would help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_358.wav	2.35	It is a memorial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_359.wav	2.65	This is a club on the rise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_360.wav	3.71	All the investment is possible through the public sector.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_361.wav	3.24	I was conceived in Aberdeen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_362.wav	2.78	The death rates are still as high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_363.wav	3.46	He's been in a nursing home for two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_364.wav	3.07	It's now down in black and white.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_365.wav	4.22	Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_366.wav	3.80	They have not done so this season so far.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_367.wav	3.42	It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_368.wav	2.95	There is no signature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_369.wav	2.77	I am a wealthy person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_370.wav	2.95	Colour was at the core of his life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_371.wav	3.37	He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_372.wav	2.35	It is hard to understand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_373.wav	2.01	Something is wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_374.wav	2.13	You can cope with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_375.wav	2.99	It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_376.wav	4.78	It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_377.wav	4.01	Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_378.wav	2.56	It is the old story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_379.wav	1.84	It looked like a river.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_380.wav	1.92	It's a real problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_381.wav	5.51	A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_382.wav	4.27	The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_383.wav	2.56	It's like a basketball.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_384.wav	3.42	Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_385.wav	1.71	It can help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_386.wav	3.93	I love the thought of having a crack at the defending title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_387.wav	1.66	They are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_388.wav	2.22	I'm glad I came.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_389.wav	2.61	But we are a young side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_390.wav	2.01	That set the tone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_391.wav	2.39	It was a breathtaking moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_392.wav	2.13	What happened in the summer?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_393.wav	4.27	The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_394.wav	3.33	There were no immediate reports of injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_395.wav	3.89	The prison has been affected by unrest in the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_396.wav	2.99	What was the difference between them?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_397.wav	3.42	He will be judged by his actions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_398.wav	4.74	Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_399.wav	2.73	It is an absolute nonsense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_400.wav	3.76	However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_402.wav	5.38	But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_403.wav	1.88	It might be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_404.wav	3.03	Feel the air, the space.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_405.wav	1.80	He scored a touchdown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_406.wav	4.27	The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_407.wav	3.76	Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_408.wav	3.84	Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_409.wav	3.88	That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_410.wav	2.69	We went straight into the bedroom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_411.wav	4.44	However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_413.wav	3.16	I am extremely cautious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_414.wav	2.48	Paris is not only young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_415.wav	3.71	That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_416.wav	1.71	He is to appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_417.wav	2.73	It all began as an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_418.wav	2.05	We have to expand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_419.wav	4.01	There is no suggestion of any sinister intent on his behalf.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_420.wav	3.24	Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_421.wav	3.29	I know the worry over Iraq.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_422.wav	4.78	The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_423.wav	2.86	It's been a long, long journey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_424.wav	2.73	We are now up against it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_425.wav	4.27	Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_426.wav	2.26	I want a career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_427.wav	2.86	He deserved a red card.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_428.wav	2.99	And they replied.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p275\p275_429.wav	5.47	However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_002.wav	4.14	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_003.wav	7.68	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_004.wav	5.46	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_005.wav	7.30	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_006.wav	6.70	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_007.wav	5.68	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_008.wav	8.66	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_009.wav	5.04	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_010.wav	3.97	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_011.wav	7.55	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_012.wav	5.46	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_013.wav	5.34	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_014.wav	5.29	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_015.wav	6.49	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_016.wav	7.81	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_017.wav	4.69	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_018.wav	6.49	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_019.wav	7.90	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_020.wav	4.78	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_021.wav	9.86	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_022.wav	7.22	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_023.wav	12.42	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_024.wav	7.30	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_025.wav	3.50	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_026.wav	2.14	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_027.wav	2.69	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_028.wav	2.69	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_029.wav	2.91	What do we do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_030.wav	3.46	They might have asked, for goodness sake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_031.wav	2.99	Smoking is also very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_032.wav	3.50	We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_033.wav	4.10	Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_034.wav	5.38	He said police inquiries should not be conducted as political opportunism.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_035.wav	3.03	There was a rush of water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_036.wav	2.22	A fiver and I'll tell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_037.wav	3.25	We speak about the performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_038.wav	3.46	She is employed on short-term contracts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_039.wav	3.54	Further management changes are planned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_040.wav	3.63	I can feel the sound inside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_041.wav	4.36	Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_042.wav	3.37	He is married with three children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_043.wav	4.18	I might well have done so already.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_044.wav	3.50	This is slightly negative for inflation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_045.wav	3.03	And they had a case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_046.wav	3.59	We believe a third party was involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_047.wav	4.23	Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_048.wav	2.73	It carried a double message.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_049.wav	4.65	Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_050.wav	3.33	But not a penny has been paid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_051.wav	3.72	Perhaps it is eyeing a mortgage bank.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_052.wav	4.40	You must always attempt to raise the bar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_053.wav	4.95	The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_054.wav	4.10	Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_055.wav	3.55	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_056.wav	3.97	They have shown a great desire and attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_057.wav	3.63	Among them are many criminals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_058.wav	3.55	And they removed a Borderer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_059.wav	3.20	He is too weak to move.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_060.wav	5.38	Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_061.wav	4.01	They desperately want some stability.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_062.wav	3.59	Everything is possible in football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_063.wav	3.33	We like being the underdogs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_064.wav	3.08	He looks like an Afghan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_065.wav	3.46	This trend is likely to strengthen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_066.wav	2.99	He will need that machine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_067.wav	4.57	Then they scored two goals to win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_068.wav	4.65	Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_069.wav	3.37	Pulled a huge number of viewers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_070.wav	5.04	The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_071.wav	3.20	Let's not be too despondent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_072.wav	2.73	There was no safety net.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_073.wav	3.80	The Government does not go far enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_074.wav	3.33	He phoned the number in the brochure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_075.wav	4.19	A spokeswoman for the Law Society of Scotland said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_076.wav	3.63	He confirmed that the document was valid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_077.wav	3.20	The wingers must have felt the cold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_078.wav	4.06	In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_079.wav	3.37	I have made that offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_080.wav	3.46	Why do it otherwise ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_081.wav	3.80	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_082.wav	2.82	So, did she meet him ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_083.wav	3.37	So what is the campaign about ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_084.wav	3.37	The new deal will now be put to the officers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_085.wav	3.84	Carlton also declined to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_086.wav	3.37	But the organisers refused to worry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_087.wav	3.03	Webster was brought up in Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_088.wav	5.29	Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was not breaking the Government's directions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_089.wav	3.29	Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_090.wav	3.72	The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_091.wav	4.10	He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_092.wav	4.23	Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_093.wav	2.99	Funding needs to be long term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_094.wav	2.82	We should all be grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_095.wav	3.16	He's not getting into any games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_096.wav	3.67	The coach is a man who is very ambitious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_097.wav	3.46	We are talking about the outskirts of London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_098.wav	3.07	It was exactly four months away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_099.wav	3.41	This is equally relevant to the landowner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_100.wav	3.63	THE Farmer wants a new campaign.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_101.wav	3.07	We are satisfied with this outcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_102.wav	3.16	Robin Williams is very subdued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_103.wav	2.90	It wasn't possible to relax.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_104.wav	3.33	Context is also very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_105.wav	2.39	There could be a way back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_106.wav	3.93	They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_107.wav	3.41	Both sides have been hit by injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_108.wav	3.97	People had been talking about a fourth quarter rally.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_109.wav	3.08	Even the one she loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_110.wav	3.42	Talk of a crisis is absurd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_111.wav	2.95	He's been active in Arabia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_112.wav	4.27	England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_113.wav	4.18	Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_114.wav	2.90	It is sometimes like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_115.wav	3.63	He was unprepared for this fight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_116.wav	2.86	I've had it for the exams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_117.wav	3.07	Those people must be accountable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_118.wav	3.33	If they liked it then I'll be happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_119.wav	3.97	It's very bad timing, but it's happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_120.wav	2.43	Choice is a good thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_121.wav	2.69	I am not very pleased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_122.wav	3.33	New Zealand rugby is totally different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_123.wav	3.20	Petrol prices were widely blamed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_124.wav	3.80	Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_125.wav	4.27	Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_126.wav	3.89	Many others are subjected to violence by men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_127.wav	4.10	Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_128.wav	3.71	Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_129.wav	2.39	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_130.wav	2.99	Potions said he would drive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_131.wav	3.03	Diversions were put in place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_132.wav	2.52	The Queen Mother is dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_133.wav	3.97	No one person or small group could be singled out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_134.wav	3.12	The excitement could hardly be contained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_135.wav	3.16	Margins are also in retreat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_136.wav	4.52	Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_137.wav	3.71	He had missed a penalty against the English.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_138.wav	3.89	The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_139.wav	3.88	I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_140.wav	4.36	It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_141.wav	3.33	Cutting ticket prices would certainly help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_142.wav	4.87	We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_143.wav	3.72	Absences should be carefully monitored.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_144.wav	4.02	Four meetings have previously been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_145.wav	4.53	The rise in retail sales was the first since August.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_146.wav	4.69	Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_147.wav	2.74	We just have to adapt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_148.wav	2.65	Are you from the rugby ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_149.wav	2.61	What happened in that game ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_150.wav	2.18	Are you going to win ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_151.wav	2.39	Was it the wife ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_152.wav	1.54	Why change it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_153.wav	2.78	And they all have a vote.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_154.wav	3.16	But they must believe in themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_155.wav	3.97	Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_156.wav	4.05	Token gestures of tiny tax cuts will not do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_157.wav	2.95	We made a world record together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_158.wav	3.63	This is the logic of punishment assaults.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_159.wav	4.22	But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_160.wav	3.63	That was the first time I worked with Richard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_161.wav	4.27	They said so that I would look good in uniform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_162.wav	2.86	A good actor doesn't think.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_163.wav	3.25	That's what happened against Ayr.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_164.wav	3.50	Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_165.wav	3.88	He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_166.wav	2.77	It is a good lifestyle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_167.wav	3.24	Before the game we went for a pint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_168.wav	3.12	City sentiment is in his favour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_169.wav	3.12	His job was not advertised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_170.wav	3.41	Nato has left them with no other option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_171.wav	4.23	Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_172.wav	3.50	He was just like a godfather to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_173.wav	4.19	While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_174.wav	3.67	Yet the survey has been cautious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_175.wav	4.40	These people are now following their own Unison agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_176.wav	3.59	It took five months to repair the damage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_177.wav	2.73	They exist in name alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_178.wav	3.37	Advice and counselling will be offered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_179.wav	2.60	You had better believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_180.wav	3.16	It was a sobering experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_181.wav	2.56	I can see it now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_182.wav	2.73	There's still plenty time left.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_183.wav	3.76	Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_184.wav	2.60	I've no idea how it works.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_185.wav	4.14	The upturn in the housing market has given a big boost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_186.wav	3.37	The festivals will be about having fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_187.wav	5.80	This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_188.wav	2.82	She is in good spirits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_189.wav	2.95	The changes took effect from June.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_190.wav	3.16	As if that is an achievement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_191.wav	2.14	That will be the sweetness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_192.wav	3.50	Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_193.wav	4.74	Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_194.wav	2.86	There was a fossil on screen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_195.wav	3.50	The protest will go ahead as planned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_196.wav	3.67	I did not concentrate on my performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_197.wav	3.59	The feedback from them has been fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_198.wav	3.12	That admission is not surprising.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_199.wav	4.53	But he rejected calls for a public register of paedophiles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_200.wav	2.99	However, the problem is the timing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_201.wav	3.93	Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_202.wav	3.07	That was just one night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_203.wav	3.16	This is a frightening development.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_204.wav	3.38	They keep the atmosphere in mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_205.wav	3.80	Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_206.wav	3.33	Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_207.wav	3.80	That is an entirely unacceptable position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_208.wav	2.99	My father died in childbirth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_209.wav	2.78	It is quite a thing to watch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_210.wav	2.90	This should begin in October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_211.wav	2.60	Twaddle is a case in point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_212.wav	3.16	The Yugoslav army will still be there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_213.wav	3.50	Some promoters made insulting offers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_214.wav	2.65	We did what we had to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_215.wav	2.39	The squad is too small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_216.wav	2.65	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_217.wav	2.39	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_218.wav	2.48	how do you get it back ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_219.wav	2.65	What are you not good at ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_220.wav	2.39	I think, therefore I am ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_221.wav	2.22	You've got to be vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_222.wav	2.60	I learned that only yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_223.wav	2.48	It's been a humbling year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_224.wav	3.37	Nicolson is no stranger to the Highlands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_225.wav	2.44	You are a gambling man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_226.wav	4.01	Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_227.wav	2.52	My daughter is an adult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_228.wav	2.65	I would not say that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_229.wav	2.52	There was a fine line to tread.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_230.wav	2.99	The refund is fully justified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_231.wav	5.08	I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_232.wav	3.33	I never wanted a legal battle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_233.wav	2.95	It would make a lot of sense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_234.wav	3.24	It was started almost by accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_235.wav	3.80	The partnership was set up during the summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_236.wav	2.39	Bottling is now the core business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_237.wav	2.48	She died at her home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_238.wav	3.37	Had this been common practice ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_239.wav	2.73	What do they want us to do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_240.wav	2.31	Is it worth it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_241.wav	1.75	Does it matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_242.wav	2.95	How do you take them away ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_243.wav	4.82	Frankly, it was worth the booking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_244.wav	4.44	People have been wonderful beyond belief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_245.wav	2.77	We were right to be afraid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_247.wav	4.44	That group reported just before Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_248.wav	4.74	Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_249.wav	4.87	Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_250.wav	5.29	I COULD tell that Alastair Wilkie was energised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_251.wav	3.24	That view has not altered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_252.wav	5.25	No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_253.wav	3.84	For business, the benefits will be enormous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_254.wav	4.27	The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_255.wav	3.67	Five years later, the deception continued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_256.wav	4.19	Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_257.wav	4.01	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_258.wav	3.71	I felt we deserved the three points.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_259.wav	3.80	Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_260.wav	3.50	They've got some extremely good players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_261.wav	2.56	Mr Blair had done well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_262.wav	3.03	She had gone to the Catholic school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_263.wav	3.41	Then we will face the Danish champions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_264.wav	2.86	The family kept away from me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_265.wav	3.37	I would have been shot dead in bed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_266.wav	3.97	One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_267.wav	4.83	The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_268.wav	2.69	We will turn the corner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_269.wav	3.03	Of course, it is a tough assignment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_270.wav	1.96	My Dad is a hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_271.wav	3.08	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_272.wav	3.89	was everything done to save people ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_273.wav	3.46	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_274.wav	3.16	Do I think about them often ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_275.wav	2.73	Is it in the right place ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_276.wav	1.67	Did he trip ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_277.wav	3.03	This wasn't just a big crowd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_278.wav	3.54	It was a terrible combination of factors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_279.wav	2.65	This is absolutely not true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_280.wav	4.06	This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_281.wav	2.69	They should stop the bombing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_282.wav	3.93	Sunday's game against Celtic is huge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_283.wav	2.86	I've come here for the jersey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_284.wav	5.13	The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_285.wav	3.63	The strong performance is expected to continue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_286.wav	3.46	Their extinction is not inevitable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_287.wav	3.37	It's never great to finish second.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_288.wav	5.51	And, finally, I have good news for the songbirds of Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_289.wav	3.89	It's as eventful as it is momentous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_290.wav	3.29	We have a budget in March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_291.wav	4.14	Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_292.wav	4.31	However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_293.wav	3.55	That would open the gates of hell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_294.wav	3.46	Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_295.wav	2.90	We've made a couple of albums.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_296.wav	3.97	A more exhaustive analysis is in progress.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_297.wav	2.86	We have to keep our clients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_298.wav	4.40	Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_299.wav	3.24	First, the programme was unbalanced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_300.wav	2.74	Everything else is a bonus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_301.wav	4.27	This championship is different from the other majors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_302.wav	4.36	At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_303.wav	2.95	Harrowing is easy, after all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_304.wav	3.07	Each case is treated on merit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_305.wav	3.46	A winter of discontent awaits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_306.wav	4.18	They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_307.wav	2.82	I am astonished at attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_308.wav	2.91	Says the Duke of York.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_309.wav	3.46	Our destiny is in our own hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_310.wav	5.89	Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_311.wav	6.32	Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_312.wav	5.17	She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_313.wav	4.70	We've had great things in the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_314.wav	4.05	It could be done by experts and lawyers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_315.wav	3.84	It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_316.wav	2.99	It has been recorded twice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_317.wav	3.20	Aberdeen had little to offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_318.wav	4.06	It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_319.wav	3.25	I'm interested in interesting work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_320.wav	3.93	We represent a wide range of society.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_321.wav	2.86	It caused a lot of upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_322.wav	2.95	I saw them last week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_323.wav	3.07	Does that put pressure on us ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_324.wav	1.84	Did it work ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_325.wav	2.78	Do you think we are a top nation ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_326.wav	2.86	Is our children learning ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_327.wav	2.82	How independent is that ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_328.wav	2.48	What form did that take ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_329.wav	1.88	Are they free ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_330.wav	3.08	Friday night was a pretty good night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_331.wav	4.18	This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_332.wav	4.65	You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_333.wav	3.46	We are trying to clarify the issues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_334.wav	3.16	I was inspired by two things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_335.wav	4.40	The Government has completely lost control of GM crops.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_336.wav	2.91	MOVIE stars are public property.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_337.wav	3.50	It comes from reflection or thinking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_338.wav	3.93	That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_339.wav	4.14	Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_340.wav	4.57	Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_341.wav	4.61	Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_342.wav	3.80	The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_343.wav	2.95	And we have the experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_344.wav	4.01	The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_345.wav	5.21	This included a downward revision in the expected level of dividend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_346.wav	4.91	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_347.wav	3.84	You just have to give yourself a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_348.wav	4.48	They would be supported by visiting specialists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_349.wav	3.12	You have caught a serial killer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_350.wav	3.29	I won't make an official complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_351.wav	2.77	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_352.wav	3.50	I grew up with that in the amateur game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_353.wav	3.41	The move follows a review of the Singapore
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_354.wav	2.94	They make a selective perception process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_355.wav	4.05	Employees may be taken on at Livingston.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_356.wav	2.60	There is no quick fix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_357.wav	2.52	What are they for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_358.wav	2.56	Is there a waiting list ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_359.wav	3.59	Do they think anyone else wants them ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_360.wav	2.43	So what happens next ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_361.wav	3.54	Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_362.wav	3.24	Walker plans to return indoors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_363.wav	4.14	It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_364.wav	2.99	He worked there for six months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_365.wav	3.50	HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_366.wav	4.35	The business has expanded rapidly, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_367.wav	2.90	From there, they can go anywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_368.wav	2.39	I had relied on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_369.wav	2.60	Truth is the child of time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_370.wav	4.57	The Reporter appears to have undue influence on the panel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_372.wav	3.46	Anyway, the job will be part-time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_373.wav	4.06	Brown has always protested his innocence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_374.wav	3.80	And the World Cup has not even begun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_375.wav	4.53	He remains a main board director of Royal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_376.wav	4.14	This is the version which appeared in our paper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_377.wav	2.18	Instead, he missed the lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_378.wav	4.01	It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_379.wav	3.20	Laura is an investment banker.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_380.wav	5.17	Market research indicates that this is not feasible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_381.wav	4.48	Women were mostly notable by their absence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_382.wav	4.01	His background is firmly in venture capital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_383.wav	3.25	We played them off the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_384.wav	3.25	But the rally was short-lived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_385.wav	5.38	McCall is unlikely to change a winning team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_386.wav	3.76	It must be tough to live with.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_387.wav	4.06	The statement contained no surprises.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_388.wav	3.16	Six other people were injured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_389.wav	4.87	He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_390.wav	3.46	We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_391.wav	4.27	Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_392.wav	3.59	They would have to go to the Royal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_393.wav	3.85	It didn't matter who was in their way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_394.wav	3.03	He ended up a headmaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_395.wav	5.93	North African countries are also seen as potential customers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_396.wav	3.58	He is obviously very dangerous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_397.wav	4.83	The most important thing in theatre is to listen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_398.wav	3.16	That remains the unanswered question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_399.wav	5.98	You should always be able to get out in some direction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_400.wav	4.78	It depends on Labour, not on us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_401.wav	4.36	It had so much to do with output.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_402.wav	4.01	However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_403.wav	2.86	After the match, do you ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_404.wav	2.86	Has the conflict started ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_405.wav	2.65	Have I really come to this ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_406.wav	5.98	David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_407.wav	2.99	Its failure is no surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_408.wav	3.12	It has to be enforced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_409.wav	4.36	Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_410.wav	3.97	Those overseas offices were great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_411.wav	3.71	You will have seen the adverts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_412.wav	4.22	Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_413.wav	3.67	Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_414.wav	3.16	No plans for projects are yet in place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_415.wav	3.29	Three weeks later, he resigned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_416.wav	5.81	A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_417.wav	3.93	Venus rejects the very suggestion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_418.wav	3.42	A, The media has been great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_419.wav	2.95	Everything has its place and purpose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_420.wav	3.25	I have received no explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_421.wav	5.76	Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_422.wav	4.44	He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_423.wav	2.86	You didn't need to pay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_424.wav	3.37	The might be rolled out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_425.wav	2.95	But nothing could be done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_426.wav	3.41	They made such decisions in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_427.wav	4.61	Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_428.wav	2.90	It seems a waste of talents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_429.wav	4.06	Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_430.wav	3.84	This would discourage investment and job creation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_431.wav	3.03	We have no information on Iraq.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_432.wav	3.97	If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_433.wav	5.68	George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_434.wav	2.90	The company declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_435.wav	3.33	It makes no difference to their friendship.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_436.wav	2.90	They make the right decisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_437.wav	4.01	I always savour the company of The Voice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_438.wav	5.08	It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_439.wav	4.31	Today has been a good day for Northern Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_440.wav	2.69	I got a yellow card.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_441.wav	3.67	It's an option, but I can't really comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_442.wav	3.25	Not many people like to do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_443.wav	3.58	He now lives in Fenwick in Ayrshire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_444.wav	4.65	I might also completely change the routine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_445.wav	2.86	We accept the new rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_446.wav	3.29	He was due to retire in December.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_447.wav	2.86	We go there with confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_448.wav	4.06	They are interior designers and architects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_449.wav	2.86	He was released after treatment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_450.wav	3.84	I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_451.wav	4.10	When I was four years old I used to do like this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_452.wav	5.21	They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_453.wav	4.65	I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_454.wav	3.29	They must play for each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_455.wav	3.46	We are aiming for early March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_456.wav	3.33	Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_457.wav	4.01	The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_458.wav	3.03	It will take place in July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_459.wav	3.08	There's not much money in cycling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_460.wav	2.82	We will pay their bills.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_461.wav	4.74	This court has made an order which has not been observed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_462.wav	3.76	It was very positive and very helpful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_463.wav	3.76	Now we see no mention of rising rates.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_464.wav	5.94	Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p276\p276_465.wav	2.69	We are having a look.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_002.wav	3.50	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_003.wav	7.81	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_004.wav	4.87	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_005.wav	6.58	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_006.wav	6.27	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_007.wav	4.78	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_008.wav	8.58	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_009.wav	5.34	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_010.wav	3.03	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_011.wav	7.43	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_012.wav	5.30	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_013.wav	4.65	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_014.wav	5.59	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_015.wav	6.36	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_016.wav	7.00	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_017.wav	3.84	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_018.wav	6.36	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_019.wav	7.68	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_020.wav	4.40	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_021.wav	9.48	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_022.wav	7.47	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_023.wav	12.46	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_024.wav	7.60	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.It's nice to hear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_025.wav	3.97	People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_026.wav	2.05	Is this accurate?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_027.wav	2.22	They have no history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_028.wav	3.67	Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_029.wav	3.41	The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_030.wav	2.39	There's a story, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_031.wav	2.22	This is the window.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_032.wav	2.48	He was jailed for five years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_033.wav	4.74	Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_034.wav	3.93	We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_035.wav	2.86	Then, suddenly, they weren't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_036.wav	1.97	Was it worth it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_037.wav	4.48	Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_038.wav	3.59	However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_039.wav	3.76	We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_040.wav	1.88	They're just different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_041.wav	5.00	Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_042.wav	4.61	A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_043.wav	2.35	Indeed, he does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_044.wav	3.50	I did not see any reason to change the captain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_045.wav	2.39	He's just in it for himself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_046.wav	5.34	However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_047.wav	4.91	It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_048.wav	2.14	We will push.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_049.wav	4.95	Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_050.wav	3.25	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_051.wav	1.92	It is bizarre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_052.wav	2.18	They said she was stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_053.wav	2.69	Is a drug dealer?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_054.wav	4.44	The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_055.wav	2.82	He is too weak to move.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_056.wav	3.30	They were on holiday in Egypt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_057.wav	2.82	He looks like an Afghan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_058.wav	4.05	No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_059.wav	2.14	Here's a clue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_060.wav	3.20	It had been in place since last July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_061.wav	2.22	Next league matches Celtic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_062.wav	2.90	There was no safety net.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_063.wav	1.84	It is unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_064.wav	1.71	That's the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_065.wav	1.54	They are ready.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_066.wav	3.67	We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_067.wav	2.86	I feel I did not have enough time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_068.wav	3.97	The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_069.wav	4.95	George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_070.wav	1.49	They are real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_071.wav	5.64	Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_072.wav	2.35	That was a gold medal for certain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_073.wav	1.71	He was popular.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_074.wav	2.31	But I've won both ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_075.wav	2.39	There was an e-mail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_076.wav	2.39	Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_077.wav	3.63	Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_078.wav	3.08	Painful, but only because it's true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_079.wav	2.39	I had my suspicions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_080.wav	2.56	He was at home with his pals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_081.wav	1.92	It was magic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_082.wav	5.38	The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_083.wav	2.82	It is a job creation scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_084.wav	4.48	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_085.wav	3.20	Even the one she loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_086.wav	2.48	Today she has been released.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_087.wav	2.26	He is in the queue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_088.wav	3.50	He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_089.wav	3.33	What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_090.wav	2.56	Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_091.wav	2.44	Someone who cares
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_092.wav	2.77	By then, he was walking on water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_093.wav	4.10	It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_094.wav	1.88	It is a blow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_095.wav	3.29	Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_096.wav	2.18	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_097.wav	4.57	Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_098.wav	2.61	Today I couldn't run on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_099.wav	3.93	This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_100.wav	3.46	I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_101.wav	1.54	It was clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_102.wav	1.71	It is annoying.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_103.wav	1.67	But I was wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_104.wav	1.67	I love the Dome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_105.wav	4.40	We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_106.wav	3.42	Our position remains unchanged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_107.wav	3.12	I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_108.wav	4.49	Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_109.wav	4.10	Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_110.wav	1.66	You should be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_111.wav	3.46	After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_112.wav	2.39	Two of the team became ill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_113.wav	2.14	He takes the job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_114.wav	2.18	She reflects a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_115.wav	2.56	I am just trying to do my job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_116.wav	5.67	Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_117.wav	3.41	While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_118.wav	2.56	I was fighting for my life, I thought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_119.wav	4.31	Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_120.wav	1.92	It is so sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_121.wav	2.18	The mood is upbeat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_122.wav	1.67	It is rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_123.wav	4.18	That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_124.wav	3.54	There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_125.wav	1.63	Who would have?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_126.wav	2.95	There were no grounds for his action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_127.wav	2.73	I can't even get into the A team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_128.wav	1.84	I'm so angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_129.wav	2.52	She really suffered for her art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_130.wav	4.48	It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_131.wav	4.61	The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_132.wav	2.48	No production was achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_133.wav	3.33	The BBC was a disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_134.wav	3.50	This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_135.wav	3.93	It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_136.wav	3.46	The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_137.wav	3.67	Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_138.wav	4.01	Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_139.wav	4.48	On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_140.wav	4.95	It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_141.wav	2.52	I had decided to quit the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_142.wav	2.31	We want to keep the pound.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_143.wav	3.76	Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_144.wav	4.23	And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_145.wav	1.92	Who would be right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_146.wav	2.18	She died at her home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_147.wav	2.48	He realises his mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_148.wav	4.40	The role of the law lords would be retained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_149.wav	2.48	It is not just about pay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_150.wav	5.13	Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_151.wav	2.09	So I got a blood test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_152.wav	4.01	It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_153.wav	4.40	But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_154.wav	1.92	I was so nervous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_155.wav	3.59	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_156.wav	4.57	The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_157.wav	2.73	We also enjoyed a lot of support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_158.wav	2.56	We are on a four-year mission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_159.wav	2.09	They should come clean.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_160.wav	2.05	My Dad is a hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_161.wav	1.96	He can do no wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_162.wav	2.01	Well, he should know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_163.wav	2.44	It is so unfair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_164.wav	1.97	I will tell you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_165.wav	2.86	I've put my own money into this project.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_166.wav	4.44	Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_167.wav	1.84	It is not like us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_168.wav	2.35	We've all had the shots.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_169.wav	4.01	It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_170.wav	1.79	Again, we were lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_171.wav	3.59	Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_172.wav	2.56	Does that put pressure on us?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_173.wav	4.36	It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_174.wav	4.10	They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_175.wav	2.22	As we worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_176.wav	2.39	Tony had arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_177.wav	5.55	And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_178.wav	4.18	Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_179.wav	3.54	It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_180.wav	2.82	They need to look after themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_181.wav	3.41	I saw military vehicles in the distance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_182.wav	3.33	What has caused the demise of singing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_183.wav	2.52	Our team is just so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_184.wav	4.31	Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_185.wav	3.20	Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_186.wav	5.55	Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_187.wav	4.57	But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_188.wav	2.39	Peace was won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_189.wav	1.63	It's a fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_190.wav	4.40	The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_191.wav	3.42	We believe a third party was involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_192.wav	3.93	On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_193.wav	2.31	Tommy is not a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_194.wav	4.19	I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_195.wav	2.18	But she might be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_196.wav	3.50	I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_197.wav	2.73	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_198.wav	3.25	They make a selective perception process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_199.wav	3.42	We have an election in eight days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_200.wav	3.42	Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_201.wav	3.84	This gives a financial incentive to switch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_202.wav	4.27	The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_203.wav	3.20	Twaddle is a case in point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_204.wav	3.03	A Grampian Police spokesman said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_205.wav	3.67	He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_206.wav	2.94	In each case they were a goal down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_207.wav	3.16	I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_208.wav	3.42	However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_209.wav	4.36	The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_210.wav	3.63	The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_211.wav	3.80	Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_212.wav	4.10	I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_213.wav	3.67	At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_214.wav	3.76	You should always be able to get out in some direction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_215.wav	2.43	It's not before time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_216.wav	2.99	The report is due out next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_217.wav	2.18	But she was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_218.wav	5.37	Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_219.wav	2.78	At the time, he was a living legend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_220.wav	1.75	They must do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_221.wav	5.64	Dewar was certainly under attack from within his own party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_222.wav	3.46	However, no further action was taken by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_223.wav	2.35	Until they came to do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_224.wav	3.59	Half of young people had had contact with the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_225.wav	2.65	Well, they were the unlucky ones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_226.wav	2.05	There is no excuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_228.wav	4.18	On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_229.wav	2.39	But it's a subtle process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_230.wav	3.41	He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_231.wav	4.18	Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_232.wav	2.65	In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_233.wav	3.97	A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_234.wav	1.80	It is hard won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_235.wav	2.35	Our policy is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_236.wav	2.35	The scene is about this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_237.wav	4.57	The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_238.wav	2.14	There wasn't a goal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_239.wav	2.18	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_240.wav	1.88	There's the mix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_241.wav	2.35	The concerns are the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_242.wav	1.75	I can't get a job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_243.wav	4.69	For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_244.wav	4.27	It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_245.wav	5.04	However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_246.wav	4.14	One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_248.wav	2.73	Is that a serious question?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_249.wav	2.48	This is the first step.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_250.wav	2.69	They must play for each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_251.wav	2.69	Souter will be back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_252.wav	4.35	George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_253.wav	2.18	Blood samples were taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_254.wav	3.11	They want to shut the Scottish Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_255.wav	2.82	We shall rely on human beings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_256.wav	2.61	This is a question of Islam.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_257.wav	5.59	He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_258.wav	3.63	Immediate action must be taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_259.wav	1.84	It's very nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_260.wav	3.16	He was also married with two children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_261.wav	2.52	The system can work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_262.wav	4.23	It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_263.wav	1.84	We're in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_264.wav	2.95	Our objective is to tackle poverty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_265.wav	2.44	It's a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_266.wav	4.40	The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_267.wav	2.31	It was very fast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_268.wav	3.46	The record companies have gone through the floor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_269.wav	4.14	He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_270.wav	4.10	In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_271.wav	2.43	If not, he should go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_272.wav	4.44	It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_273.wav	2.31	He looked very sharp.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_274.wav	3.71	There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_275.wav	2.22	All options are open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_276.wav	2.35	Dialogue is the key.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_277.wav	3.12	They have shown a great desire and attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_278.wav	1.79	It was a virus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_279.wav	3.12	Maloney is an engaging talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_280.wav	4.10	The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_281.wav	2.52	This is a national crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_282.wav	1.54	It was good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_283.wav	2.27	Who did the recruiting?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_284.wav	3.16	Bombing slaughter rejected
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_285.wav	2.52	The songs are just so good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_286.wav	1.97	The goals will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_287.wav	1.88	There's a pause.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_288.wav	4.61	That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_289.wav	2.77	I was the sheep.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_290.wav	2.18	What has altered?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_291.wav	3.37	I was brought up in a mining background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_292.wav	2.05	Nothing is safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_293.wav	4.14	It would still have been a good film, but very different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_294.wav	3.16	One was a lawyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_295.wav	4.05	The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_296.wav	1.92	They are wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_297.wav	3.97	Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_298.wav	2.01	The plot is minimal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_299.wav	2.05	You are the glory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_300.wav	3.50	However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_301.wav	2.18	The letters are going out today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_302.wav	2.91	We want to play at the worlds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_303.wav	4.10	He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_304.wav	2.56	My whole life has changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_305.wav	2.56	We are a peaceful people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_306.wav	2.78	You may have a short memory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_307.wav	4.23	It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_308.wav	2.27	My body is clearly capable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_309.wav	4.05	Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_310.wav	3.80	It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_311.wav	2.56	A review is under way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_312.wav	1.54	It will work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_313.wav	2.69	I came into this world with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_314.wav	2.56	It's too horrible to think.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_315.wav	3.59	We think all other measures are not exhausted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_316.wav	2.09	Off with their heads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_317.wav	2.73	Is there a new way forward?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_318.wav	3.12	I was invited to work in Germany.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_319.wav	2.22	Is that an issue?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_320.wav	3.50	Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_321.wav	4.05	You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_322.wav	2.69	The same things will happen with GM foods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_323.wav	3.59	I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_324.wav	3.12	It sounded as if it might well be tragic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_325.wav	1.66	Well, it won't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_326.wav	2.26	These days are long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_327.wav	2.26	Two people were interviewed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_328.wav	2.09	I've got no secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_329.wav	4.91	The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_330.wav	3.72	We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_331.wav	4.18	In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_332.wav	3.97	Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_333.wav	4.74	A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_334.wav	4.65	This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_335.wav	2.31	He loves the big occasions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_336.wav	3.08	The performance was excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_337.wav	2.90	That has been lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_338.wav	2.01	Tell us about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_339.wav	4.02	He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_340.wav	2.26	She said they would appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_341.wav	5.68	A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_342.wav	5.38	Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_343.wav	3.46	Both of those promises have already been honoured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_344.wav	4.14	In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_346.wav	2.17	As, indeed, they would be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_347.wav	3.75	It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_348.wav	4.95	To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_349.wav	2.43	We will be homeless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_350.wav	4.36	Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_351.wav	3.80	Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_352.wav	3.37	Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_353.wav	3.25	There was a substantial explosion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_354.wav	2.39	Not so, it seems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_355.wav	1.62	He could make it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_356.wav	2.78	Four policemen were wounded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_357.wav	3.88	We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_358.wav	3.12	It's now down in black and white.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_359.wav	2.74	Now, though, he has an incentive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_360.wav	4.06	Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_361.wav	4.48	They have not done so this season so far.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_362.wav	3.84	This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_363.wav	3.46	It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_364.wav	2.22	So there, we won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_365.wav	3.20	By that time, however, it was already too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_366.wav	2.30	There is no signature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_367.wav	2.09	It was a funny game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_368.wav	2.65	He was the architect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_369.wav	3.84	I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_370.wav	2.69	I've never seen a game like it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_371.wav	2.56	I am a wealthy person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_372.wav	4.87	Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_373.wav	3.50	He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_374.wav	2.60	The Cabinet is split over the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_375.wav	1.71	Something is wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_376.wav	1.88	You can cope with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_377.wav	3.37	I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_378.wav	2.78	That's the name of the game, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_379.wav	4.06	Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_380.wav	5.93	Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_381.wav	4.57	Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_382.wav	3.07	At the last I found a bunker.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_383.wav	2.61	Yet the data is compelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_384.wav	3.59	One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_385.wav	1.75	It's a real problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_386.wav	3.67	On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_387.wav	3.12	I was in the train station overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_388.wav	1.54	It is unusual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_389.wav	3.59	The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_390.wav	2.22	It's like a basketball.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_391.wav	3.46	Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_392.wav	4.14	I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_393.wav	4.23	The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_394.wav	3.46	It was a kind of contempt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_395.wav	2.65	It was a breathtaking moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_396.wav	1.92	The car was just there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_397.wav	2.39	It will take place in July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_398.wav	4.19	The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_399.wav	1.71	Is that possible?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_400.wav	2.56	But, in fact, the reverse is true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_401.wav	3.16	What was the difference between them?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_402.wav	2.44	Emotions were complex.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_403.wav	1.66	Then , he laughs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_404.wav	4.69	Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_405.wav	2.39	It is an absolute nonsense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_406.wav	3.59	They recorded their debut album in New York.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_407.wav	3.84	However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_408.wav	4.01	He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_409.wav	5.17	But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_410.wav	2.35	Feel the air, the space.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_411.wav	1.88	He got his degree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_412.wav	3.76	I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_413.wav	2.01	went on sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_414.wav	2.39	But we finished the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_415.wav	2.43	Mentally, you have to be tough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_416.wav	2.94	The people around me were fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_417.wav	2.73	I wanted to help the poor people in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_418.wav	2.48	It is legally binding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_419.wav	3.03	Is there any prospect of this happening?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_420.wav	2.27	There's been a mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_421.wav	2.95	We just got a phone call on Saturday night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_422.wav	3.03	Eriksson would have approved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_423.wav	2.73	I am extremely cautious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_424.wav	2.18	It was little else.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_425.wav	2.56	It all began as an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_426.wav	5.17	The MoD has denied any cover-up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_427.wav	2.90	I know the worry over Iraq.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_428.wav	3.50	It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_429.wav	3.89	Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_430.wav	4.57	The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_431.wav	2.05	We are all equal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_432.wav	3.16	It's been a long, long journey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_433.wav	2.14	We were used.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_434.wav	4.61	Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_435.wav	4.48	However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_436.wav	3.54	They were not even allowed to see them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_437.wav	4.14	That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_438.wav	2.52	Horses are drawn by ballot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_439.wav	2.39	It won the match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_440.wav	1.88	And it showed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_441.wav	4.31	The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_442.wav	2.01	I hate the word.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_443.wav	3.63	Who would be in that desert?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_444.wav	2.14	I was lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_445.wav	2.14	The children are fine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_446.wav	2.99	They have to come up with a solution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_447.wav	3.37	That was the first time I worked with Richard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_448.wav	3.03	The whole region is in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_449.wav	4.23	When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_450.wav	2.39	It was a total disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_451.wav	4.40	There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_452.wav	2.18	I got a yellow card.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_453.wav	3.29	Stewart was the life and soul of the party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_454.wav	4.40	Scotland has a dismal record of teenage pregnancy rates.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_455.wav	3.41	We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_456.wav	2.48	If they don't, they should say so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_457.wav	2.10	It is a vicious circle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_458.wav	4.52	Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_459.wav	4.10	She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_460.wav	2.95	I'd love to be like Peter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_461.wav	4.61	I am greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_462.wav	3.93	From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p277\p277_463.wav	5.80	The consultants report commissioned by the previous Government was not published.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_002.wav	4.05	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_003.wav	10.33	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_004.wav	6.62	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_005.wav	11.65	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_006.wav	8.36	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_007.wav	7.26	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_008.wav	10.59	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_009.wav	5.85	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_010.wav	4.53	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_011.wav	6.87	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_012.wav	6.61	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_013.wav	5.04	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_014.wav	5.89	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_015.wav	7.04	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_016.wav	8.28	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_017.wav	3.63	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_018.wav	5.81	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_019.wav	8.96	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_020.wav	4.10	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_021.wav	12.04	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_022.wav	8.45	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_023.wav	14.85	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_024.wav	8.32	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_025.wav	5.12	A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_026.wav	4.57	These decisions are not simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_027.wav	3.80	Life was like a timetable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_028.wav	4.27	She is employed on short-term contracts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_029.wav	4.91	They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_030.wav	3.37	The director will be present.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_031.wav	4.06	Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_032.wav	4.01	If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_033.wav	2.99	It carried a double message.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_034.wav	4.40	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_035.wav	4.06	You must always attempt to raise the bar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_036.wav	4.01	Several investments have already been made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_037.wav	3.03	It was a hell of a way to lose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_038.wav	3.33	Among them are many criminals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_039.wav	4.18	The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_040.wav	3.20	This will get their attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_041.wav	5.21	Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_042.wav	3.80	Well, the climate has changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_043.wav	3.29	Must be prepared to use it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_044.wav	3.12	He looks like an Afghan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_045.wav	3.20	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_046.wav	2.52	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_047.wav	2.70	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_048.wav	3.29	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_049.wav	2.14	He will need that machine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_050.wav	3.80	I have learned from him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_051.wav	3.55	I had trouble with the producers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_052.wav	2.78	He also presented You Bet!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_053.wav	3.59	People come to see the Highlands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_054.wav	4.48	They are to ensure information reaches as many members as possible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_055.wav	2.73	We have not given up hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_056.wav	3.42	She said she was really sorry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_057.wav	2.52	None has ever been found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_058.wav	2.86	Let's hope that it does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_059.wav	4.27	The baby was later transferred to a hospital in Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_060.wav	3.07	It was exactly four months away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_061.wav	2.69	Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_062.wav	3.25	Only water is currently allowed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_063.wav	2.39	I'm looking to the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_064.wav	3.38	But it has been an amazing experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_065.wav	2.26	The judge was really nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_066.wav	5.67	The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_067.wav	2.43	The fans would love it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_068.wav	4.10	Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_069.wav	2.65	The party is up for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_070.wav	2.73	Even the one she loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_071.wav	3.16	It was a unanimous decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_072.wav	3.08	It's all going to clear the debt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_073.wav	4.14	This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_074.wav	3.25	Last week, he was taken into hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_075.wav	3.63	Petrol prices were widely blamed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_076.wav	3.76	By then, he was walking on water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_077.wav	2.86	We have to offer value for money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_078.wav	3.20	It's so hard to shift.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_079.wav	3.29	Mr Smith declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_080.wav	5.72	Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_081.wav	3.46	That was a great performance by the team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_082.wav	4.78	He said a change in legislation was long overdue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_083.wav	4.53	The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_084.wav	3.12	Everyone had to play the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_085.wav	2.69	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_086.wav	3.08	It was clear on Thursday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_087.wav	3.41	It's not a holiday time for football players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_088.wav	2.94	But they must believe in themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_089.wav	3.46	We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_090.wav	4.87	However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_091.wav	3.50	Thomson is expected to manage the business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_092.wav	3.67	The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_093.wav	4.40	It was some time before she found out he was safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_094.wav	3.33	In the end we made too many errors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_095.wav	3.03	That time is not now, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_096.wav	3.29	We created so many chances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_097.wav	2.78	Our house was very small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_098.wav	2.69	Why do it otherwise ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_099.wav	3.29	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_100.wav	2.90	So, did she meet him ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_101.wav	2.86	So what is the campaign about ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_102.wav	2.18	And does it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_103.wav	3.08	Are you from the rugby ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_104.wav	2.14	Had I heard ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_105.wav	4.53	Athletics is on a roll in the country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_106.wav	4.61	We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_107.wav	3.33	I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_108.wav	2.77	We have got a race.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_109.wav	3.50	The music industry hasn't changed at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_110.wav	2.99	Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_111.wav	2.86	He was jailed for a year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_112.wav	2.78	They almost achieved a draw.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_113.wav	3.37	Football is a passion for many.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_114.wav	2.56	I didn't think so either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_115.wav	3.59	It was located on the remote control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_116.wav	3.42	Maybe this battle has been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_117.wav	2.78	That might help a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_118.wav	5.42	This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_119.wav	2.69	Ferguson will be a millionaire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_120.wav	2.73	You can spend money on housing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_121.wav	3.59	The hearing was due to continue today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_122.wav	3.55	There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_123.wav	2.48	However, the problem is the timing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_124.wav	2.86	This is a frightening development.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_125.wav	2.65	Which can happen any time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_126.wav	3.84	It was not a finale he would want to remember.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_127.wav	2.86	We had another last Tuesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_128.wav	2.90	I didn't feel under any pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_129.wav	3.03	This should begin in October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_130.wav	4.35	That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_131.wav	3.76	The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_132.wav	5.80	Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_133.wav	3.85	That would open the gates of hell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_134.wav	3.63	You've got to be vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_135.wav	5.59	But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_136.wav	5.38	The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_137.wav	3.33	Before it was an ordeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_138.wav	2.82	It will affect their work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_139.wav	3.54	I love the spectacle of cinema.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_140.wav	2.82	They could use a boost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_141.wav	2.95	Frankly, it was worth the booking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_142.wav	2.48	Anyone can do the sums.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_143.wav	2.82	Others are not so sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_144.wav	2.69	I have always loved the countryside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_145.wav	4.27	It was his job to check.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_146.wav	3.37	I haven't made any definite decisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_147.wav	3.20	There's always the next century.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_148.wav	3.03	There's only one team in Ayrshire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_149.wav	4.06	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_150.wav	3.88	I prefer the clarity of the existing system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_151.wav	2.69	Nothing was meant by it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_152.wav	4.57	The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_153.wav	5.12	Its loss was an economic catastrophe for the whole of Moray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_154.wav	3.29	It was by the numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_155.wav	2.18	I knew he was good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_156.wav	2.69	We will turn the corner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_157.wav	4.10	Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_158.wav	2.73	These days are long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_159.wav	4.44	Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_160.wav	3.29	The strong performance is expected to continue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_161.wav	3.63	The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_162.wav	2.27	So was the first half.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_163.wav	2.90	It's never great to finish second.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_164.wav	4.35	You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_165.wav	2.69	We have a budget in March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_166.wav	2.99	He is keen to stay in public service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_167.wav	4.10	As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_168.wav	4.74	US is the only country to vote against resolution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_169.wav	3.84	Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_170.wav	2.52	On my day I can beat anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_171.wav	2.65	We've made a couple of albums.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_172.wav	2.52	My life has been destroyed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_173.wav	2.65	What happened in that game ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_174.wav	1.96	Are you going to win ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_175.wav	2.10	Was it the wife ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_176.wav	1.75	Why change it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_177.wav	2.91	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_178.wav	3.24	I always felt they played for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_179.wav	2.69	His team management was protective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_180.wav	4.31	You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_181.wav	3.97	First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_182.wav	3.24	The outcome is now in our own hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_183.wav	3.29	I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_184.wav	3.46	It is vital to clarify their role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_185.wav	3.16	It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_186.wav	3.93	They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_187.wav	2.48	Says the Duke of York.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_188.wav	3.20	That's not fair to the supporters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_189.wav	2.86	They need to look after themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_190.wav	2.26	I've always been like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_191.wav	3.25	It could be done by experts and lawyers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_192.wav	2.69	They were seriously after him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_193.wav	2.82	But there's an upturn in the sector.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_194.wav	2.90	It shows the strength of the roots.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_195.wav	4.48	It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_196.wav	2.78	It caused a lot of upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_197.wav	3.42	However, this idea is never developed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_198.wav	3.29	I had come back from London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_199.wav	3.80	Last night was a key episode.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_200.wav	3.03	They are still very quiet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_201.wav	3.37	I wanted to put myself on the line.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_202.wav	2.99	I came home by ambulance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_203.wav	3.27	We've had an enjoyable adventure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_204.wav	3.33	It comes from reflection or thinking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_205.wav	5.08	Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_206.wav	3.29	We could soon be in that same position!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_207.wav	3.42	It was a horrible thing to happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_208.wav	3.24	The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_209.wav	3.50	I am very realistic about these things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_210.wav	2.86	I won't make an official complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_211.wav	2.95	He is a good signing for Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_212.wav	2.52	Bombing is the easy option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_213.wav	3.20	It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_214.wav	3.37	The move follows a review of the Singapore
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_215.wav	3.54	They make a selective perception process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_216.wav	5.00	Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_217.wav	3.80	This gives a financial incentive to switch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_218.wav	2.73	They have known the hard times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_219.wav	2.78	It was important to win the singles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_220.wav	2.56	The only problem was the greens.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_221.wav	2.65	January is a bad time of year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_222.wav	3.03	His injury was completely random.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_223.wav	2.95	Today we must not repeat that mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_224.wav	3.20	Twaddle is a case in point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_225.wav	2.82	I'm just a regular person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_226.wav	2.35	My daughter is an adult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_227.wav	1.84	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_228.wav	2.48	how do you get it back ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_229.wav	2.14	What are you not good at ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_230.wav	2.95	I think, therefore I am ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_231.wav	1.71	Who was she ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_232.wav	3.03	It was finally agreed on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_233.wav	2.69	IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_234.wav	5.76	Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_235.wav	3.16	The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_236.wav	4.57	Women were mostly notable by their absence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_237.wav	4.86	The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_238.wav	2.86	I have spoken to the skipper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_239.wav	3.72	So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_240.wav	3.93	The statement contained no surprises.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_241.wav	3.71	A small number of new jobs will also be created.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_242.wav	3.50	This would include the GM food industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_243.wav	4.27	My wife and family are the support system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_244.wav	6.57	They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_245.wav	5.25	He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_246.wav	3.16	I need a publishing deal!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_247.wav	3.76	It had so much to do with output.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_248.wav	4.70	A fatal accident inquiry will be held into the death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_249.wav	4.14	The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_250.wav	3.63	That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_251.wav	3.54	There were no reports of casualties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_252.wav	4.35	After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_253.wav	3.20	It might be sad, but it's a fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_254.wav	3.76	He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_255.wav	3.41	They made such decisions in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_256.wav	2.99	It seems a waste of talents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_257.wav	3.84	I was just getting over the time difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_258.wav	3.50	Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_259.wav	2.73	You can feel at home in China.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_260.wav	3.80	We have no information on Iraq.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_261.wav	3.37	Persuaded to change his mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_262.wav	3.63	Paterson can afford to be generous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_263.wav	4.87	Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_264.wav	3.55	I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_265.wav	3.97	No production contract is yet in sight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_266.wav	4.61	Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_267.wav	3.20	Messages have to be reinforced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_268.wav	4.74	It is not enough to be first division champions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_269.wav	2.82	We accept the new rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_270.wav	2.73	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_271.wav	2.99	was everything done to save people ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_272.wav	3.42	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_273.wav	2.69	Do I think about them often ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_274.wav	3.54	Is it in the right place ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_275.wav	4.27	Blair is very positive at European Councils.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_276.wav	4.01	They are interior designers and architects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_277.wav	3.63	He was released after treatment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_278.wav	5.04	I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_279.wav	3.20	I'd never run for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_280.wav	3.50	It does not work that way in Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_281.wav	4.06	Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_282.wav	2.99	These figures are truly terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_283.wav	3.46	The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_284.wav	3.63	The stage was set for a showdown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_285.wav	3.50	This could put pressure on UK inflation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_286.wav	3.25	I'd like to report a murder.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_287.wav	3.63	They want to shut the Scottish Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_288.wav	4.14	It all started with a visiting rugby club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_289.wav	3.54	Those overseas offices were great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_290.wav	3.67	I understand the security issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_291.wav	3.16	Truth is the child of time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_292.wav	3.42	It has become a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_293.wav	6.02	Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_294.wav	4.66	Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_295.wav	3.37	It was never a free kick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_296.wav	3.46	They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_297.wav	3.07	This is a great opportunity for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_298.wav	5.08	Scottish rugby has given me everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_299.wav	3.59	You have to expect this type of thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_300.wav	5.08	However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_301.wav	2.95	So the Government will be damaged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_302.wav	4.95	It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_303.wav	3.29	Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_304.wav	2.69	John was there already in spirit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_305.wav	4.18	There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_306.wav	4.05	I intended to look for another club on loan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_307.wav	4.52	We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_308.wav	3.58	He will address the nation this evening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_309.wav	3.93	They have shown a great desire and attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_310.wav	3.88	I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_311.wav	3.12	Maloney is an engaging talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_312.wav	3.37	It's not covered by the insurance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_313.wav	3.80	Mr Campbell received a phone call.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_314.wav	5.12	I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_315.wav	2.82	You have to see it like this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_316.wav	2.65	You have asked for action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_317.wav	3.16	Holland won by five wickets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_318.wav	3.80	Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_319.wav	2.73	The answer was in space.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_320.wav	3.08	It's unlikely to be renewed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_321.wav	3.03	I first met him last summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_322.wav	2.78	The songs are just so good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_323.wav	3.16	The casting is as perfect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_324.wav	3.37	Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_325.wav	4.99	Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_326.wav	3.16	McNaughton was not so sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_327.wav	4.31	The dealer is on notice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_328.wav	6.87	We believe the world has too many refugees already.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_329.wav	3.41	She had gone to the Catholic school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_330.wav	2.78	The party lasted all night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_331.wav	4.82	The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_332.wav	5.42	Much the same thing happens in a young company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_333.wav	3.41	They come to enjoy themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_334.wav	3.97	That meant the search was unlawful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_335.wav	3.03	And he goes with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_336.wav	4.66	That reflected a tumble in banking shares across the board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_337.wav	3.20	We are on a four-year mission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_338.wav	2.65	The letters are going out today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_339.wav	3.08	We want to play at the worlds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_340.wav	4.01	Do you think we are a top nation ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_341.wav	2.91	How independent is that ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_342.wav	2.65	What form did that take ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_343.wav	2.30	What are they for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_344.wav	2.52	Is there a waiting list ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_345.wav	7.00	The advisers had some discussions, but no conclusion was reached.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_346.wav	3.33	The Premier League has been a huge success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_347.wav	3.08	And he is immensely loyal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_348.wav	5.64	It looks as though the issue, with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_349.wav	4.06	Other musicians were found in retirement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_350.wav	3.76	That is a trend which will be encouraged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_351.wav	2.91	And it was this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_352.wav	4.70	Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_353.wav	4.01	My view has now completely changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_354.wav	5.63	Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_355.wav	3.37	He was at school in Devon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_356.wav	3.33	Finally came the moment of truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_357.wav	3.37	This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_358.wav	3.50	A crucial moment has arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_359.wav	5.55	In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_360.wav	2.31	Three years ago he would have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_361.wav	2.95	But we welcome this document.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_362.wav	3.37	It intends to do so on Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_363.wav	3.08	His views are hardly surprising.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_364.wav	4.14	He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_365.wav	3.55	The Allies intend to maintain the average.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_366.wav	3.42	We put our bid in last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_367.wav	3.63	Their condition is described as satisfactory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_368.wav	2.78	We're still the only ones in the High Street.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_369.wav	2.22	I was delighted to accept.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_370.wav	4.40	A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_371.wav	3.88	Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_372.wav	4.65	The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_373.wav	4.35	From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_374.wav	4.19	Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_375.wav	2.52	He must have seen the movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_376.wav	5.42	The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_377.wav	5.97	The major championships will always have a special place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_378.wav	3.54	That is a break with tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_379.wav	3.08	This decision is a farce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_380.wav	1.92	Is it worth it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_381.wav	1.92	Does it matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_382.wav	2.65	How do you take them away ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_383.wav	3.80	However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_384.wav	2.86	After the match, do you ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_385.wav	3.63	Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_386.wav	2.61	In due course the deal was done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_387.wav	2.77	This remains the party's policy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_388.wav	2.56	They will fight for everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_389.wav	3.16	Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_390.wav	2.95	The team hadn't been picked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_391.wav	3.37	One-third of the places are already taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_392.wav	2.91	I always knew she was funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_393.wav	3.46	The marshall at the turn was great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_394.wav	4.19	There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_395.wav	3.59	They have not got anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_396.wav	3.46	The law would appear to be on our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_397.wav	3.46	It has happened for generations.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_398.wav	4.06	The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_399.wav	5.04	The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_400.wav	2.90	There's still no-one like him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_401.wav	3.58	They know it'll be fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_402.wav	4.05	This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_403.wav	2.86	Clark is back on top form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_404.wav	3.29	I had a fortunate war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_405.wav	3.33	We must improve our relations with government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_406.wav	3.42	The Cabinet is split over the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_407.wav	3.42	Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_408.wav	3.24	That is the ultimate revenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_409.wav	2.69	The next few months will tell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p278\p278_410.wav	4.01	A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_002.wav	3.55	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_003.wav	6.40	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_004.wav	3.97	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_005.wav	4.78	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_006.wav	5.17	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_007.wav	3.84	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_008.wav	6.44	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_009.wav	4.52	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_010.wav	2.86	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_011.wav	6.02	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_012.wav	4.14	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_013.wav	4.14	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_014.wav	4.44	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_015.wav	5.38	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_016.wav	5.33	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_017.wav	3.67	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_018.wav	5.25	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_019.wav	6.79	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_020.wav	4.06	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_021.wav	8.96	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_022.wav	6.15	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_023.wav	9.52	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_024.wav	5.76	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_025.wav	4.35	It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_026.wav	4.14	He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_027.wav	3.38	The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_028.wav	2.56	They should be so lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_029.wav	1.92	Is this accurate?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_030.wav	3.71	I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_031.wav	2.35	There's a story, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_032.wav	3.16	People love to see this stuff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_033.wav	3.12	He took me on a tour of the wards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_034.wav	2.61	Horses are drawn by ballot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_035.wav	4.87	It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_036.wav	3.59	They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_037.wav	2.13	They're just different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_038.wav	3.67	Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_039.wav	4.44	Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_040.wav	2.60	President Bush is at war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_041.wav	2.86	She is believed to be in South Africa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_042.wav	2.09	I was scared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_043.wav	2.52	Dancing was her life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_044.wav	2.56	It will come all right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_045.wav	4.31	It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_046.wav	1.71	We will push.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_047.wav	2.78	That period was a struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_048.wav	2.05	It is urgent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_049.wav	3.42	It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_050.wav	1.92	The judge said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_051.wav	4.44	Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_052.wav	3.42	We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_053.wav	1.62	It's a blessing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_054.wav	2.69	But it might have done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_055.wav	4.78	The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_056.wav	1.97	As she explains.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_057.wav	4.74	Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_058.wav	4.27	He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_059.wav	1.66	Life is good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_060.wav	3.33	We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_061.wav	1.75	Here's a clue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_062.wav	2.52	He had no enemies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_063.wav	2.61	Sadly, it can't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_064.wav	3.37	We have not given up hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_065.wav	4.27	Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_066.wav	2.26	That's the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_067.wav	2.31	They were too hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_068.wav	4.01	The problems are a result of that shortfall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_069.wav	2.56	Art is extra.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_070.wav	2.65	They're appalled by that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_071.wav	5.21	George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_072.wav	2.65	Scotland had great assets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_073.wav	1.92	He was popular.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_074.wav	2.48	Have a look at our accounts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_075.wav	3.55	It is like a river running by my home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_076.wav	3.16	The end result is precisely the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_077.wav	2.35	It seemed so personal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_078.wav	3.29	Painful, but only because it's true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_079.wav	2.44	He had been a singer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_080.wav	1.84	I've been there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_081.wav	3.29	They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_082.wav	2.65	Both sides have been hit by injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_083.wav	2.99	She died in hospital two hours later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_084.wav	2.43	Is there a new way forward?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_085.wav	2.27	It works for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_086.wav	4.22	It is a time bomb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_087.wav	3.29	This is the way things should be handled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_088.wav	5.34	The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_089.wav	4.70	It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_090.wav	2.99	Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_091.wav	4.06	Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_092.wav	2.82	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_093.wav	6.14	Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_094.wav	2.26	Yet, it worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_095.wav	4.52	This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_096.wav	2.05	It is an old family habit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_097.wav	2.99	Until you hit the big games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_098.wav	3.72	The peace process will be buried!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_099.wav	2.95	The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_100.wav	4.14	We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_101.wav	3.93	The selection process is still at a very early stage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_102.wav	3.67	However, we have not come to any conclusions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_103.wav	4.18	After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_104.wav	2.74	I see no need for change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_105.wav	2.57	That would be unlawful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_106.wav	2.91	I didn't play well last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_107.wav	3.50	Before the game we went for a pint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_108.wav	3.12	They will want to perform well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_109.wav	3.80	For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_110.wav	2.22	I don't have many friends.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_111.wav	4.65	O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_112.wav	4.27	Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_113.wav	2.26	I was angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_114.wav	2.43	This is a step backwards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_115.wav	4.40	We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_116.wav	3.46	This film will be totally awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_117.wav	2.56	My office is bare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_118.wav	2.30	Does this mean.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_119.wav	5.93	They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_120.wav	4.83	That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_121.wav	2.60	Who would have?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_122.wav	5.34	Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_123.wav	2.73	We work on the same level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_124.wav	4.23	You can spend money on housing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_125.wav	4.36	I felt very strongly that England should have it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_126.wav	4.57	Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_127.wav	2.01	I'm so angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_128.wav	3.03	Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_129.wav	4.27	Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_130.wav	4.10	Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_131.wav	4.06	Well, you can have a tree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_132.wav	6.02	We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_133.wav	3.67	Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_134.wav	2.56	It will be too hot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_135.wav	3.97	The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_136.wav	2.31	I am now unemployed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_137.wav	2.78	You've got to be vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_138.wav	2.52	It's perfectly feasible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_139.wav	3.55	There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_140.wav	3.33	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_141.wav	5.59	That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_142.wav	3.93	And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_143.wav	4.14	We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_144.wav	2.35	Is that Titanic?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_145.wav	5.51	That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_146.wav	2.43	It is like a football team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_147.wav	3.63	I am just trying to do my job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_148.wav	2.18	They did very well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_149.wav	1.93	You know the type.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_150.wav	2.94	In each case they were a goal down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_151.wav	5.12	The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_152.wav	5.21	A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_153.wav	2.60	It was the same at Twickenham.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_154.wav	3.97	We also enjoyed a lot of support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_155.wav	3.33	He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_156.wav	3.03	This latter point is hugely important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_157.wav	2.39	I am very happy with life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_158.wav	3.16	These days are long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_159.wav	2.77	It is an attitude of mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_160.wav	3.29	But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_161.wav	4.27	Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_162.wav	3.21	As, indeed, they would be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_163.wav	2.74	I have got a wife to feed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_164.wav	4.40	We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_165.wav	3.03	Tell it like it was?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_166.wav	2.90	It is not too late to get on board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_167.wav	5.50	It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_168.wav	3.88	By then, however, both men were already in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_169.wav	3.46	Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_170.wav	2.56	Nobody did in those days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_171.wav	2.99	My life has been destroyed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_172.wav	3.59	His team management was protective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_173.wav	2.48	Is Saddam a threat?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_174.wav	3.76	We wanted it left for a wee while.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_175.wav	4.70	But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_176.wav	3.29	It is not either national standards or local control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_177.wav	2.65	The clarity is vital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_178.wav	2.86	The hotel was now for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_179.wav	3.03	I drove the ball well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_180.wav	2.99	That has been the easy part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_181.wav	4.57	Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_182.wav	4.95	No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_183.wav	2.94	Government will intervene.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_184.wav	3.16	We knew nothing about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_185.wav	4.48	Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_186.wav	4.70	It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_187.wav	1.79	It's a joke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_188.wav	2.13	Does this matter?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_189.wav	3.97	It just came into my head that day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_190.wav	3.46	My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_191.wav	3.33	It was an odd affair, in many respects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_192.wav	3.07	It is tough, but possible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_193.wav	3.67	We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_194.wav	3.84	The procedure is the same in all cases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_195.wav	4.48	Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_196.wav	4.65	The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_197.wav	2.01	It was typical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_198.wav	3.25	Our strategy is straightforward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_199.wav	4.44	There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_200.wav	1.80	I have a cold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_201.wav	2.82	Tommy is not a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_202.wav	4.95	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_203.wav	4.14	The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_204.wav	2.65	He had suffered a heart attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_205.wav	5.25	The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_206.wav	4.44	I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_207.wav	4.83	Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_208.wav	2.39	There was no rescue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_209.wav	3.97	We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_210.wav	2.22	I don't want to use it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_211.wav	3.42	This gives a financial incentive to switch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_212.wav	4.66	The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_213.wav	3.38	The road was closed for several hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_214.wav	3.93	That is an important part of our role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_215.wav	4.95	Twaddle is a case in point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_216.wav	3.20	I am delighted for Simon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_217.wav	3.29	By hard work, is the answer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_218.wav	4.06	I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_219.wav	4.61	However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_220.wav	2.95	His death was a tragic accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_221.wav	4.44	He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_222.wav	2.09	He's a nice guy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_223.wav	4.95	But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_224.wav	4.65	A career as a doctor is on hold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_225.wav	2.48	I am immensely sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_226.wav	3.93	I'd never seen a play about me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_227.wav	1.75	It is a gamble.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_228.wav	2.90	My neighbours are horrified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_229.wav	4.10	At the time, he was a living legend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_230.wav	6.66	Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_231.wav	3.93	They are the innocent victims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_232.wav	4.70	Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_233.wav	3.67	Broke the birdie record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_234.wav	4.44	Police later said the scheme would end in November.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_235.wav	2.18	It is set in Paris.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_236.wav	2.35	They should come forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_237.wav	4.65	It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_238.wav	3.50	Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_239.wav	2.14	You take a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_240.wav	2.78	It's too much work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_241.wav	5.04	The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_242.wav	5.81	It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_243.wav	2.99	He will go a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_244.wav	3.20	We did not compete with any other local farmer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_245.wav	3.33	The scene is about this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_246.wav	3.97	It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_247.wav	5.00	We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_248.wav	2.82	He's a lovely young man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_249.wav	4.02	There will be widespread support on all sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_250.wav	2.95	This year I understood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_251.wav	4.27	This is the culture change in medicine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_252.wav	3.50	He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_253.wav	5.21	He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_254.wav	4.91	For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_255.wav	4.10	It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_256.wav	4.61	That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_257.wav	2.86	This is a big club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_258.wav	4.18	Blair is very positive at European Councils.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_259.wav	2.44	they fail to engage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_260.wav	3.07	People should not become complacent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_261.wav	5.81	The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_262.wav	3.16	The warning is timely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_263.wav	7.09	Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_264.wav	2.48	Blood samples were taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_265.wav	3.50	It looks as though he will be right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_266.wav	5.68	Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_267.wav	3.76	I am totally horrified by the sentence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_268.wav	2.35	It's very nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_269.wav	2.82	It left me with a sadness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_270.wav	3.80	It was an easy decision to come here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_271.wav	3.89	It is the same in Sweden.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_272.wav	3.80	That could be in place by next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_273.wav	2.09	Things can change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_274.wav	3.29	A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_275.wav	2.31	The script was funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_276.wav	2.86	They seem to get away with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_277.wav	2.78	She looked so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_278.wav	3.33	It happens from time to time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_279.wav	4.35	For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_280.wav	7.43	They expect the minister to ensure that commitment is honoured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_281.wav	4.74	There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_282.wav	4.99	I intended to look for another club on loan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_283.wav	3.50	You've got to have both sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_284.wav	3.25	The attacker died in the crash.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_285.wav	2.61	It was a virus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_286.wav	3.72	Maloney is an engaging talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_287.wav	2.61	Who will perform?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_288.wav	2.61	It's like a high school play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_289.wav	2.05	It was hopeless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_290.wav	4.40	I asked for a positive response and I was given one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_291.wav	4.27	She said she could not believe that they had run away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_292.wav	3.89	He wrote the letter two days before he died.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_293.wav	2.39	It changed my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_294.wav	2.95	These figures are truly awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_295.wav	2.95	He should have won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_296.wav	2.26	Sunday's game was not a trial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_297.wav	4.91	Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_298.wav	2.10	What has altered?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_299.wav	2.35	Graeme was prepared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_300.wav	3.12	I thought it was my only chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_301.wav	2.73	One was a lawyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_302.wav	5.04	The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_303.wav	2.10	They are wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_304.wav	3.59	This is a war over our home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_305.wav	5.38	In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_306.wav	4.91	Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_307.wav	2.74	It was entirely justified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_308.wav	6.23	They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_309.wav	2.35	It's certainly different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_310.wav	3.59	The letters are going out today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_311.wav	2.90	I did not name it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_312.wav	4.31	The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_313.wav	3.20	Special measures were needed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_314.wav	3.33	It is all credit to them today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_315.wav	2.14	They were fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_316.wav	3.67	Craig is a major concern for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_317.wav	3.25	My body is clearly capable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_318.wav	2.43	I came into this world with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_319.wav	2.35	The airport was even different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_320.wav	2.86	Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_321.wav	4.22	But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_322.wav	2.39	He got the same story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_323.wav	4.14	They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_324.wav	3.12	He was then replaced by Ross.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_325.wav	2.61	She did not attend the courtroom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_326.wav	4.40	You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_327.wav	5.13	In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_328.wav	3.33	Was this element always there?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_329.wav	2.86	They haven't got a hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_330.wav	2.09	He did a good job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_331.wav	5.25	I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_332.wav	2.31	It is so unfair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_333.wav	3.72	It will be very, very tight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_334.wav	6.74	That is the very reason why it was so vital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_335.wav	5.38	In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_336.wav	3.80	The composer will conduct.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_337.wav	3.20	It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_338.wav	2.39	Alex Ferguson is the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_339.wav	3.63	The boat was fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_340.wav	2.99	I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_341.wav	3.63	Like his acting, it was an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_342.wav	5.38	A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_343.wav	2.99	You need a licence to run a pub.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_344.wav	3.33	The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_345.wav	3.80	The salary changes are long overdue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_346.wav	3.71	The decision is an absolute disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_347.wav	2.35	It is horrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_348.wav	3.07	The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_349.wav	2.86	I kept going for her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_350.wav	2.69	He has seen the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_351.wav	2.48	Hartley should know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_352.wav	2.86	We are looking for perfection.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_353.wav	3.29	It's not pretty, but it's effective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_354.wav	2.09	It's that sort of night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_355.wav	1.84	He could make it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_356.wav	3.21	Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_357.wav	1.88	I lost my head.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_358.wav	5.30	For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_359.wav	3.25	It was a double tragedy for the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_360.wav	2.73	He put some colour into Scottish history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_361.wav	2.69	Well, the big day has arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_362.wav	4.31	So there, we won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_363.wav	4.48	By that time, however, it was already too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_364.wav	5.29	Breaking new ground is also very rewarding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_365.wav	2.82	There is no signature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_366.wav	7.22	Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_367.wav	5.04	There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_368.wav	3.42	He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_369.wav	2.56	He has the edge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_370.wav	2.48	Again, we were lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_371.wav	2.01	He denied the charge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_372.wav	3.72	Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_373.wav	5.55	It has been a lovely family occasion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_374.wav	2.73	That's the name of the game, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_375.wav	3.46	YOU thought it was a headache.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_376.wav	4.52	Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_377.wav	3.46	We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_378.wav	2.43	It doesn't always work that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_379.wav	2.39	I'm pleased about one thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_380.wav	2.82	We try to keep it right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_381.wav	4.48	The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_382.wav	2.22	It's like a basketball.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_383.wav	3.50	Stewart will travel with some confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_384.wav	2.31	I can lead by example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_385.wav	6.15	He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_386.wav	2.74	He is on the wrong side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_387.wav	4.78	It will probably take me just days to spend it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_388.wav	2.95	I was in jail for five years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_389.wav	2.44	It will take place in July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_390.wav	4.01	However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_391.wav	5.04	The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_392.wav	3.24	I never won a penny throughout my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_393.wav	3.42	His remarks appear to have had an effect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_394.wav	2.31	He's already made history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_395.wav	1.67	So I did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_396.wav	1.97	You ask the question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_397.wav	4.10	Not because they want to sing about something.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_398.wav	1.92	You make the choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_399.wav	4.14	I have been in good form for the last two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_400.wav	3.63	A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_401.wav	3.80	Nobody even knew it had happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_402.wav	2.05	What would be the point?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_403.wav	4.27	The weekly average was three hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_404.wav	6.23	Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_405.wav	3.84	The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p279\p279_406.wav	4.99	Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_001.wav	2.31	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_002.wav	4.01	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_003.wav	7.17	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_004.wav	5.76	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_005.wav	7.34	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_006.wav	6.19	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_007.wav	4.61	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_008.wav	7.68	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_009.wav	5.21	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_010.wav	4.01	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_011.wav	6.87	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_012.wav	6.23	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_013.wav	5.80	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_014.wav	6.32	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_015.wav	6.23	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_016.wav	7.26	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_017.wav	4.19	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_018.wav	6.96	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_019.wav	7.51	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_020.wav	4.31	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_021.wav	10.97	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_022.wav	7.64	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_023.wav	12.80	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_024.wav	7.13	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_025.wav	3.80	He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_026.wav	4.61	His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_027.wav	4.31	I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_028.wav	3.89	The west coast line is not just for middle England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_029.wav	3.63	The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_030.wav	3.08	She brought a lot to my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_031.wav	3.59	Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_032.wav	3.80	Thomson and his family left court without comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_033.wav	4.44	I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_034.wav	3.84	But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_035.wav	4.36	It is about control of our economy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_036.wav	4.23	Each brand was owned by a different family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_037.wav	4.61	That was not perfect golf by any means.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_038.wav	4.14	He added that her comments were noted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_039.wav	2.86	She will get through it I'm sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_040.wav	4.52	Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_041.wav	4.65	Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_042.wav	3.16	He does not even trust his own members.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_043.wav	3.03	He too started on the subs seats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_044.wav	2.26	Is it worth it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_045.wav	1.75	Does it matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_046.wav	2.48	How do you take them away ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_047.wav	3.42	However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_048.wav	2.48	After the match, do you ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_049.wav	3.50	Has the conflict started ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_050.wav	3.59	Have I really come to this ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_051.wav	2.95	I'm as fit as I can get.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_052.wav	3.80	We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_053.wav	5.17	He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_054.wav	5.72	The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_055.wav	3.67	Andy was a huge influence yet again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_056.wav	3.37	They seem too much of a sure thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_057.wav	3.54	Her husband had been waiting for her return.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_058.wav	3.12	You must always attempt to raise the bar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_059.wav	2.65	We just want this season to end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_060.wav	4.06	It was a day she thought she would never see.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_061.wav	3.89	Talks have continued at many different levels.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_062.wav	4.02	The referee is there to decide these things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_063.wav	3.46	There were no details of the other five victims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_064.wav	3.58	It also has a good labour supply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_065.wav	3.55	Indeed he has a lot of output.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_066.wav	4.18	Do not give your details to anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_067.wav	3.42	He was failed by his health authority.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_068.wav	2.99	But it was not all bad news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_069.wav	4.31	I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_070.wav	3.84	But during the bid process, that changed completely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_071.wav	3.16	It turned me against the whole system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_072.wav	4.14	She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_073.wav	4.48	I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_074.wav	3.46	But two groups refused to sign up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_075.wav	4.57	I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_076.wav	4.19	It had little effect on European equity markets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_077.wav	3.88	I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_078.wav	4.36	The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_079.wav	3.59	The squad spent the night at police headquarters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_080.wav	3.12	They said our costs were too high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_081.wav	2.78	I do not attempt to answer that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_082.wav	2.86	It's been a great evening for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_083.wav	3.20	That kind of growth is the important thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_084.wav	4.53	A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_085.wav	3.89	No plans for projects are yet in place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_086.wav	5.12	Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_087.wav	4.99	I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_088.wav	3.88	Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_089.wav	3.80	I feel I did not have enough time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_090.wav	3.76	Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_091.wav	3.46	I can't remember a lot about the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_092.wav	3.37	Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_093.wav	3.80	They had the appeal of TV stars.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_094.wav	4.10	There is no issue of national security involved here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_095.wav	3.42	He will be a very hard act to follow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_096.wav	6.32	Earlier, both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_097.wav	4.06	Put simply, it goes something like this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_098.wav	4.23	Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_099.wav	2.82	Even if he doesn't have any lines.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_100.wav	2.82	I am delighted to hear this news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_101.wav	3.71	We are already seeing some positive results.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_102.wav	3.50	We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_103.wav	2.69	We were under a bit of pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_104.wav	3.03	They won't actually make any money from it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_105.wav	3.55	I bought a flat six years ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_106.wav	5.33	They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_107.wav	3.20	They are a different team at home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_108.wav	4.06	It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_109.wav	3.37	Scotland is never far away at Westminster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_110.wav	3.67	Some young girls also came by last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_111.wav	6.45	Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_112.wav	2.31	What are they for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_113.wav	2.65	Is there a waiting list ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_114.wav	2.65	Do they think anyone else wants them ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_115.wav	2.61	So what happens next ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_116.wav	2.65	Had this been common practice ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_117.wav	2.48	What do they want us to do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_118.wav	3.80	The idea is the shop within a shop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_119.wav	3.89	I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_120.wav	3.50	It is the right package for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_121.wav	3.76	They have no real friends in the region.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_122.wav	4.74	England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_123.wav	4.02	Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_124.wav	5.59	In Glasgow, a sheriff dismissed five cases yesterday without hearing evidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_125.wav	3.55	I think there's not much between them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_126.wav	3.08	So I am going in the right direction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_127.wav	5.04	Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_128.wav	3.33	We have to offer value for money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_129.wav	4.35	It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_130.wav	4.44	I could live without the attention, he admitted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_131.wav	3.59	He's got to look after himself now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_132.wav	4.44	He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_133.wav	3.54	No country has a similar training programme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_134.wav	2.95	There is no future in rock music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_135.wav	5.98	Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_136.wav	4.36	Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_137.wav	3.54	The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_138.wav	3.50	We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_139.wav	4.36	The programme has been made with great care.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_140.wav	3.63	There was only one living room, you see.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_141.wav	3.25	I am not under any new pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_142.wav	4.18	The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_143.wav	3.67	It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_144.wav	4.91	They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_145.wav	3.46	All eight victims were based in Germany.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_146.wav	4.19	Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_147.wav	3.37	You should feel involved in their lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_148.wav	3.29	It is open season on the Old Firm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_149.wav	2.82	Is it in the right place ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_150.wav	1.63	Did he trip ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_151.wav	2.48	Does that put pressure on us ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_152.wav	1.67	Did it work ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_153.wav	2.52	Do you think we are a top nation ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_154.wav	3.80	Three senior officials were dismissed last week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_155.wav	3.59	Time may already have run out for this option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_156.wav	4.14	No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_157.wav	3.33	When it happened, he could hardly believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_158.wav	3.67	They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_159.wav	4.70	As our national coach, Brown is done for.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_160.wav	4.44	A progress report will be published in October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_161.wav	3.93	This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_162.wav	3.50	That will reduce my chance of selection.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_163.wav	5.85	When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_164.wav	3.38	Surely it can't run for two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_165.wav	3.07	But the game is still wide open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_166.wav	3.67	It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_167.wav	4.74	However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_168.wav	3.59	I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_169.wav	3.46	We had to work very hard for our points.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_170.wav	3.03	That is a big risk at any price.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_171.wav	3.38	You need a long-term strategy in football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_172.wav	3.84	He said some things which were better left alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_173.wav	3.46	If successful, several records will be made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_174.wav	5.89	The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_175.wav	3.20	It didn't come as any great surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_176.wav	3.42	Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_177.wav	3.08	It's just a different way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_178.wav	4.05	Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_179.wav	3.03	Nato has left them with no other option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_180.wav	3.07	I am secure in my own position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_181.wav	4.18	Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_182.wav	3.59	She is believed to be in South Africa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_183.wav	5.46	The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_184.wav	3.63	We have come a long way since then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_185.wav	5.04	I made my mind up before we came on tour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_186.wav	4.27	A great player has to win major championships.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_187.wav	4.91	Highland health board has a responsibility here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_188.wav	3.54	I didn't miss the big house at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_189.wav	3.46	The story was not made public by this club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_190.wav	6.15	That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_191.wav	3.71	You are not long home from work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_192.wav	3.12	I am fighting the force of nature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_193.wav	3.54	It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_194.wav	3.93	Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_195.wav	3.63	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_196.wav	2.82	was everything done to save people ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_197.wav	2.91	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_198.wav	3.41	But they had to be paid for.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_199.wav	5.04	There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_200.wav	3.89	The police insisted that they were standard issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_201.wav	4.53	One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_202.wav	3.33	I've never had a year like this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_203.wav	3.54	Full details are expected to be released in June.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_204.wav	3.59	As you see with the fuel duty business, they do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_205.wav	3.84	Hague will be leader at the election after next.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_206.wav	3.80	He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_207.wav	3.07	I want an answer from the British Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_208.wav	4.27	Gas production was also at record levels last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_209.wav	3.41	They are a victim of their own success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_210.wav	3.80	We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_211.wav	3.41	This is a young squad and we're all supporters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_212.wav	3.20	It is going to change the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_213.wav	5.76	Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_214.wav	4.40	People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_215.wav	4.48	The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_216.wav	2.78	I am not going to judge them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_217.wav	3.50	I do not see this so much as failure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_218.wav	4.27	A European final must be the millennium target.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_219.wav	3.97	Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_220.wav	3.97	I was independent but I am not now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_221.wav	4.40	We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_222.wav	3.33	We are still seeking that complete performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_223.wav	4.78	My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_224.wav	4.10	Someone should force President Bush to watch this film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_225.wav	5.08	The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_226.wav	3.63	If not, a deal could take many months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_227.wav	4.01	This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_228.wav	4.05	Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_229.wav	3.37	I want to see as much progress as possible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_230.wav	4.66	This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_231.wav	4.10	I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_232.wav	4.78	The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_233.wav	5.21	They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_234.wav	3.80	The labour side has developed in the North area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_235.wav	2.43	You are not allowed to do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_236.wav	2.65	That is the last thing they need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_237.wav	3.63	He has worked for several years in the United States.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_238.wav	3.50	The children were later able to leave by bus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_239.wav	3.12	Jim was down there with his wife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_240.wav	2.99	Was it the wife ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_241.wav	1.97	Why change it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_242.wav	2.78	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_243.wav	2.35	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_244.wav	2.61	how do you get it back ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_245.wav	4.74	What are you not good at ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_246.wav	2.52	I think, therefore I am ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_247.wav	3.46	Church leaders warned other homes could close.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_248.wav	5.04	The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_249.wav	3.93	My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_250.wav	3.72	He has many offers from the English Premiership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_251.wav	3.46	However, the figures tell a different story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_252.wav	4.65	The rise has come too late for some.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_253.wav	3.46	Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_254.wav	3.41	I'd rather play well next week than here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_255.wav	3.29	Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_256.wav	5.04	The British Government should follow the Irish example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_257.wav	4.53	Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_258.wav	3.97	Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_259.wav	5.89	Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_260.wav	5.29	And they never show the same film as a rival.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_261.wav	4.10	Every player goes through this after a serious injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_262.wav	3.29	There would be a north and south division.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_263.wav	3.42	The same trend showed up throughout Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_264.wav	3.33	The two companies were not for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_265.wav	4.14	His condition was described as serious last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_266.wav	5.30	The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_267.wav	2.99	The board do not own the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_268.wav	3.03	Last night Bush carried it rather easily.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_269.wav	2.99	They always want to give a performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_270.wav	4.06	Its primary business channel is the internet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_271.wav	3.38	That's been the difference between the sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_272.wav	4.10	The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_273.wav	3.37	I think I was about four years old.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_274.wav	5.29	Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_275.wav	4.40	It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_276.wav	5.04	Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_277.wav	2.73	I think the shares are good value.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_278.wav	3.59	One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_279.wav	4.31	Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_280.wav	3.97	The life office will now stay with Abbey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_281.wav	4.18	Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_282.wav	5.38	Overall, the last hole was good to the women.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_283.wav	4.66	He may be ready for first team action in March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_284.wav	3.71	The fans pay for their season tickets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_285.wav	3.12	There was just fire all around me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_286.wav	4.23	In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_287.wav	4.61	Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_288.wav	3.38	No-one had seen this sort of thing before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_289.wav	3.41	We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_290.wav	4.52	He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_291.wav	3.38	He would get into any world team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_292.wav	3.59	Its work includes dealing with child abuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_293.wav	4.14	They first met during a Step in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_294.wav	4.65	The agreement remains the only show in town.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_295.wav	5.08	The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_296.wav	3.46	The strong performance is expected to continue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_297.wav	5.16	Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_298.wav	3.29	It is based on population rather than need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_299.wav	3.63	He could understand both points of view.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_300.wav	2.52	So, did she meet him ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_301.wav	3.50	So what is the campaign about ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_302.wav	1.84	And does it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_303.wav	2.39	Are you from the rugby ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_304.wav	2.05	Had I heard ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_305.wav	2.09	What happened in that game ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_306.wav	2.09	Are you going to win ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_307.wav	4.14	It might have led to a screen career, but it didn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_308.wav	3.46	Further heavy charges are expected this year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_309.wav	4.18	It had happened on average once a week this year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_310.wav	3.67	This is the version which appeared in our paper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_311.wav	3.46	He is keen to stay in public service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_312.wav	3.88	Of course people will try the things they see on TV.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_313.wav	3.37	For that reason cover should not be given.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_314.wav	2.99	He felt too close to head office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_315.wav	2.73	If you believe in the blue and white.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_316.wav	3.88	A report on their property is due within days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_317.wav	2.99	He will just go on doing his job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_318.wav	3.50	I always felt they played for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_319.wav	4.27	That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_320.wav	4.99	The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_321.wav	4.82	This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_322.wav	7.56	We will not simply hit these people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_323.wav	3.97	We still think this trade is on the increase.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_324.wav	4.31	It is not either national standards or local control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_325.wav	4.48	His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_326.wav	4.27	I feel as if I can hole everything now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_327.wav	3.50	I try to be open to experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_328.wav	3.24	He is not exactly a pretty child.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_329.wav	3.08	I thought the race was a little bit slow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_330.wav	4.14	If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_331.wav	4.01	Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_332.wav	3.97	I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_333.wav	5.63	These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_334.wav	4.78	One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_335.wav	3.55	Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_336.wav	3.16	I hope numbers will be up on last time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_337.wav	5.55	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_338.wav	2.78	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_339.wav	2.18	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_340.wav	2.48	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_341.wav	3.84	Put another way, they just won't do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_342.wav	4.01	Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_343.wav	4.23	Getting that balance right can be very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_344.wav	4.14	Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_345.wav	4.87	Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_346.wav	3.29	It was a bit like having children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_347.wav	4.87	And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_348.wav	4.14	And that is the bottom line - box office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_349.wav	6.10	I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_350.wav	3.33	I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_351.wav	2.86	I think we are back on track.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_352.wav	3.25	Sales will begin by the end of October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_353.wav	6.66	The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_354.wav	2.90	Friday night was a pretty good night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_355.wav	5.17	It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_356.wav	4.87	The deal is expected to be completed by September.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_357.wav	4.01	It is the only natural British site on the list.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_358.wav	3.71	His style was direct and very human.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_359.wav	4.05	Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_360.wav	3.29	They have the cash and the fire power.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_361.wav	4.05	The institute board will take the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_362.wav	3.50	He's young enough and he must learn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_363.wav	3.25	Such a policy is for long-term strength.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_364.wav	3.16	Both players gave so much to the side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_365.wav	3.97	Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_366.wav	2.82	The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_367.wav	4.66	The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_368.wav	2.95	It was a goal which came from nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_369.wav	3.80	We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_370.wav	3.50	I have come here to show support for the families.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_371.wav	3.12	We have been going for three years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_372.wav	2.99	He really played us into a corner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_373.wav	3.07	They know the truth, they really know the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_374.wav	3.16	It was another black day for Ayrshire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_375.wav	3.80	Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_376.wav	2.90	It used to be all hard sell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_377.wav	3.16	The direct effects on trade will be limited.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_378.wav	4.40	He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_379.wav	3.89	He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_380.wav	3.54	This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_381.wav	2.82	This is not a small amount of money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_382.wav	3.80	The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_383.wav	3.46	I just felt that I was broken down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_384.wav	2.27	What do we do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_385.wav	2.65	Why do it otherwise ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_386.wav	2.99	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_387.wav	3.71	The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_388.wav	6.28	Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_389.wav	3.97	He remains a main board director of Royal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_390.wav	4.74	His record on Government has always been highly effective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_391.wav	6.14	My tax affairs have been totally open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_392.wav	4.61	Five years ago its return was rejected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_393.wav	5.04	But soon the game dropped back into its old ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_394.wav	5.47	In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_395.wav	3.76	In that situation, they thought we should be beaten.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_396.wav	2.69	We are keen to see truth and justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_397.wav	5.34	The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_398.wav	2.90	People have a wish to charge twice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_399.wav	3.46	I think it's a big advantage to us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_400.wav	3.63	There were no hard words between us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_401.wav	4.78	Today he will meet the Italian press but he will give little away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_402.wav	4.87	Every blood test on sheep in Scotland has been completely clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_403.wav	3.03	These old songs are very nice to play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_404.wav	2.99	My views on the decision are well known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_405.wav	3.89	I'd never seen a play about me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_406.wav	2.90	We were on top and could have won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_407.wav	4.87	Some would say that that culture had been created already.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_408.wav	3.08	So it looks like a done deal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_409.wav	3.16	The play was to go straight ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p280\p280_410.wav	4.23	At the core of these issues are real people with real jobs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_002.wav	3.71	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_003.wav	8.28	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_004.wav	5.93	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_005.wav	8.41	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_006.wav	8.24	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_007.wav	5.08	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_008.wav	8.02	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_009.wav	6.19	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_010.wav	3.41	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_011.wav	7.98	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_012.wav	5.08	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_013.wav	5.34	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_014.wav	4.18	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_015.wav	6.57	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_016.wav	7.81	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_017.wav	5.38	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_018.wav	6.53	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_019.wav	8.36	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_020.wav	5.12	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_021.wav	11.69	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_022.wav	7.68	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_023.wav	12.12	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_024.wav	8.20	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_025.wav	5.30	She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_026.wav	3.93	They are very clever in their use of words.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_027.wav	4.31	In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_028.wav	3.67	Smoking is also very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_029.wav	3.67	It's not going to work out that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_030.wav	2.95	They've got their own agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_031.wav	2.43	I'd just like to play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_032.wav	2.82	Our fans have been marvellous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_033.wav	4.57	We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_034.wav	3.07	He should emerge as the winner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_035.wav	2.95	She failed in her action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_036.wav	3.93	Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_037.wav	3.03	It carried a double message.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_038.wav	3.20	It is a financial matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_039.wav	3.29	This film will be totally awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_040.wav	2.99	They want to be entertained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_041.wav	3.97	A week is a long time in politics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_042.wav	3.25	I am just going to go for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_043.wav	3.84	There's been a wake up call for the sector this week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_044.wav	5.25	But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_045.wav	3.50	Among them are many criminals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_046.wav	4.53	The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_047.wav	2.73	He looks like an Afghan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_048.wav	3.76	That was the theory, anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_049.wav	5.38	However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_050.wav	2.78	I had come back from London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_051.wav	3.08	Pulled a huge number of viewers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_052.wav	3.08	The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_053.wav	2.48	I must take a seat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_054.wav	3.29	That is very hard, alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_055.wav	2.99	The Government should be ashamed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_056.wav	3.42	None has ever been found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_057.wav	6.02	There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_058.wav	3.03	We should be able to cope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_059.wav	3.03	It was a lovely experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_060.wav	4.53	Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_061.wav	2.69	We will pay their bills.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_062.wav	5.76	Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_063.wav	2.99	The standard is extremely high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_064.wav	3.97	Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_065.wav	3.12	Only water is currently allowed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_066.wav	3.24	The tournament has now been cancelled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_067.wav	2.69	It is a real problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_068.wav	3.12	I have proved that in the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_069.wav	2.43	He had been a singer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_070.wav	2.99	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_071.wav	3.08	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_072.wav	2.35	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_073.wav	2.48	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_074.wav	2.65	The players will be down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_075.wav	3.93	They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_076.wav	3.03	There could be a lot of confusion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_077.wav	3.37	He also received a medal of honour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_078.wav	4.66	Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_079.wav	2.91	Mini rugby is a great thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_080.wav	2.39	He is in the queue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_081.wav	2.91	I first met him last summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_082.wav	3.29	Last week, he was taken into hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_083.wav	3.80	Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_084.wav	3.89	Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_085.wav	4.53	Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_086.wav	3.89	The error appeared in a warrant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_087.wav	4.44	He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_088.wav	4.06	The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_089.wav	3.59	IT is called a killing in the trade.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_090.wav	3.20	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_091.wav	3.03	We could not get any possession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_092.wav	4.23	Officers recovered a second body in the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_093.wav	3.76	I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_094.wav	2.61	The conclusion is the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_095.wav	3.46	It is a vicious circle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_096.wav	2.35	But I know the course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_097.wav	3.63	We must stop it with the golf ball.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_098.wav	3.03	We live by the rule of law.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_099.wav	3.07	This is a national crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_100.wav	3.50	Otherwise, the market may come back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_101.wav	4.10	The following are the principal provisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_102.wav	3.12	Movement has to take place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_103.wav	3.46	City sentiment is in his favour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_104.wav	6.02	It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_105.wav	3.72	It's not a lack of confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_106.wav	2.13	It was a funny game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_107.wav	2.39	What do we do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_108.wav	2.39	Why do it otherwise ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_109.wav	3.46	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_110.wav	3.25	That is the only way forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_111.wav	3.25	They are at a very early stage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_112.wav	3.07	The whole thing is the music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_113.wav	2.52	Or it would have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_114.wav	4.23	His is a success story by any standard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_115.wav	3.76	Its replacement was not used in the exercise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_116.wav	3.59	Such actions are rarely popular.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_117.wav	3.46	I've heard this stuff about the markets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_118.wav	4.05	It is much as it has been described.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_119.wav	3.41	They've got to account for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_120.wav	3.03	Then again, we could have.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_121.wav	2.69	We have a training class.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_122.wav	4.31	Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_123.wav	3.46	Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_124.wav	3.29	It has removed a bit of guilt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_125.wav	2.80	She does not want to speak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_126.wav	3.93	Scottish Life was there over one year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_127.wav	3.55	Twaddle is a case in point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_128.wav	2.65	That is far too high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_129.wav	3.24	They made such decisions in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_130.wav	2.78	There were no serious injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_131.wav	3.25	She was also very brave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_132.wav	2.86	He wants to win a major.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_133.wav	3.07	First meeting was next week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_134.wav	3.16	I never wanted a legal battle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_135.wav	2.99	We will try to find someone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_136.wav	3.84	People come from all round the world to see it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_137.wav	3.16	We have seen a copy of the report.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_138.wav	5.34	He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_139.wav	3.76	But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_140.wav	4.10	Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_141.wav	3.63	It is not just about pay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_142.wav	3.71	It opens the door to the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_143.wav	5.12	It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_144.wav	3.71	I was caught out a little bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_145.wav	3.46	The FBI could become involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_146.wav	2.86	There's only one team in Ayrshire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_147.wav	4.65	Three hours later, the man was free.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_148.wav	3.07	We have a clean bill of health.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_149.wav	2.99	It is not normal practice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_150.wav	4.19	It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_151.wav	3.33	The family kept away from me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_152.wav	3.63	One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_153.wav	2.14	My Dad is a hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_154.wav	3.12	So what is the campaign about ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_155.wav	1.71	And does it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_156.wav	2.27	Are you from the rugby ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_157.wav	2.35	Had I heard ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_158.wav	4.40	This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_159.wav	3.33	Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_160.wav	3.42	This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_161.wav	3.67	The strong pound also took its toll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_162.wav	2.65	It is a terrible tragedy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_163.wav	4.99	Shareholders may have to wait until June to be paid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_164.wav	2.94	I have got a wife to feed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_165.wav	2.57	We have a budget in March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_166.wav	3.20	The pension levels will remain the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_167.wav	2.82	They will do their own thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_168.wav	3.76	Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_169.wav	2.90	Our position remains the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_170.wav	2.56	It's nice to be nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_171.wav	4.31	The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_172.wav	2.22	They could not match it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_173.wav	4.35	To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_174.wav	3.50	Do not imagine for a moment that they are not there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_175.wav	3.03	One season, they might do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_176.wav	2.39	You've got to be vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_177.wav	3.85	The second aspect was the fear of failure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_178.wav	3.46	I feel like my game has come a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_179.wav	3.38	The Hibs manager is no fool.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_180.wav	4.52	It is not either national standards or local control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_181.wav	3.12	If that's the case, he will struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_182.wav	2.91	The hotel was now for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_183.wav	3.12	I can't even get into the A team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_184.wav	2.61	They know no other way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_185.wav	2.65	The referee had a good game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_186.wav	3.03	I am not ready to walk away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_187.wav	2.39	Says the Duke of York.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_188.wav	4.74	The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_189.wav	3.46	Our destiny is in our own hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_190.wav	3.08	He prefers to play for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_191.wav	3.50	I have accepted the challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_192.wav	2.52	You know the sort of thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_193.wav	2.99	They were seriously after him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_194.wav	4.10	It was an odd affair, in many respects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_195.wav	4.14	And this game is all about belief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_196.wav	3.37	Aberdeen had little to offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_197.wav	2.73	That would be my view.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_198.wav	3.84	It decided to blame the media.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_199.wav	2.69	We always felt we could win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_200.wav	4.91	This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_201.wav	5.51	This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_202.wav	2.69	It's very difficult to find a buyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_203.wav	2.86	Because he was born in England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_204.wav	3.76	There was no way back for United after that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_205.wav	3.12	It was a test in itself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_206.wav	3.50	No details of the talks were given.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_207.wav	2.86	This will be our new beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_208.wav	3.46	They have the cash and the fire power.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_209.wav	4.10	We believe a third party was involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_210.wav	3.12	Tommy is not a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_211.wav	4.52	The sanctions are about collective punishment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_212.wav	5.98	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_213.wav	2.86	This is a holy place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_214.wav	3.46	He had suffered a heart attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_215.wav	4.36	The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_216.wav	2.78	You have caught a serial killer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_217.wav	5.68	We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_218.wav	2.91	You are a great player.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_219.wav	4.78	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_220.wav	2.86	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_221.wav	3.16	how do you get it back ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_222.wav	3.38	What are you not good at ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_223.wav	4.53	You have got to look at speed of response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_224.wav	4.35	It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_225.wav	3.29	We're very unhappy about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_226.wav	4.48	This gives a financial incentive to switch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_227.wav	3.97	HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_228.wav	2.74	I had relied on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_229.wav	2.95	I'm just a regular person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_230.wav	3.16	It had all been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_231.wav	4.95	Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_232.wav	3.20	I am considered a teenager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_233.wav	3.88	Anyway, the job will be part-time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_234.wav	4.91	This will secure the future of our industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_235.wav	4.10	I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_236.wav	5.80	For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_237.wav	2.82	It was a crazy day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_238.wav	3.80	It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_239.wav	3.16	That has been the easy part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_240.wav	2.78	You could feel the heat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_241.wav	2.73	We played them off the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_242.wav	4.06	After that nothing could save him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_243.wav	2.78	This is the year of the Tiger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_244.wav	3.55	Wilson will tell the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_245.wav	3.03	She died in middle age.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_246.wav	2.61	We just had a go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_247.wav	4.65	Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_248.wav	2.43	It is set in Paris.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_249.wav	2.86	He has run a hell of a race.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_250.wav	2.73	That is still in place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_251.wav	4.44	Half of young people had had contact with the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_252.wav	2.61	The irony was not lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_253.wav	3.72	The pig industry is on its knees.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_254.wav	4.83	It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_255.wav	4.31	The minister is the engineer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_256.wav	4.06	He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_257.wav	2.95	She took them for a term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_258.wav	3.42	Kingfisher can afford to wait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_259.wav	3.76	You can never tell with the manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_260.wav	4.91	Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_261.wav	4.01	Persuaded to change his mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_262.wav	4.10	Either way, the investor retains the premium.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_263.wav	4.36	The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_264.wav	4.35	In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_265.wav	3.42	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_266.wav	3.63	Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_267.wav	4.06	There will be widespread support on all sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_268.wav	3.84	That would depend on the parole board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_269.wav	3.25	The capital costs are modest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_270.wav	3.50	That could be in place by next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_271.wav	4.31	On the contrary they stand to gain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_272.wav	2.73	He looked like a schoolboy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_273.wav	4.74	England could only play the other team on the park.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_274.wav	2.82	He took over our lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_275.wav	4.86	That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_276.wav	2.99	We feel very good about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_277.wav	3.88	It does not work that way in Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_278.wav	3.71	For him then it's a labour of love.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_279.wav	3.42	We are aiming for early March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_280.wav	3.03	It is also very valuable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_281.wav	4.40	The demand is created by the supply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_282.wav	4.05	Not many companies can say that these days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_283.wav	3.84	I realised I was lucky to have it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_284.wav	3.80	That view has not altered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_285.wav	3.20	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_286.wav	3.84	was everything done to save people ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_287.wav	3.72	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_288.wav	3.50	Do I think about them often ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_289.wav	4.57	It has the potential to be another North Sea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_290.wav	5.97	Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_291.wav	3.54	He was also married with two children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_292.wav	4.01	The target is to break even by Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_293.wav	3.71	You have to expect this type of thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_294.wav	2.91	They seem to get away with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_295.wav	4.01	We have to be very, very careful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_296.wav	4.10	The partnership was set up during the summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_297.wav	3.38	It is a symbolic concert.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_298.wav	3.72	Hopefully, this week will be good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_299.wav	3.12	This is the correct decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_300.wav	3.84	He added that the business was in good shape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_301.wav	4.87	The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_302.wav	3.67	Scotch beef is badly missed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_303.wav	3.29	The rescue package is public money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_304.wav	3.63	We are not doing the Today programme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_305.wav	3.80	There should be room for creative dissent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_306.wav	3.46	These figures are truly awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_307.wav	2.69	We need to increase the membership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_308.wav	3.54	The real issue is personal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_309.wav	4.91	Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_310.wav	4.78	Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_311.wav	2.73	He was at home with his pals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_312.wav	3.16	The dealer is on notice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_313.wav	3.20	The party lasted all night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_314.wav	2.94	We are in the end game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_315.wav	3.33	They come to enjoy themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_316.wav	4.48	Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_317.wav	6.49	The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_318.wav	4.05	That meant the search was unlawful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_319.wav	3.84	This may be perfectly innocent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_320.wav	3.20	Scotland has shown the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_321.wav	4.91	He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_322.wav	3.20	The letters are going out today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_323.wav	2.82	I can see their argument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_324.wav	4.06	The Premier League has been a huge success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_325.wav	3.54	It is all credit to them today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_326.wav	3.20	The whole family was in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_327.wav	4.40	That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_328.wav	3.16	The actor has met with Mandela.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_329.wav	3.16	There is no shortage of farmers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_330.wav	3.37	It's difficult to predict the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_331.wav	5.08	It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_332.wav	3.29	But the Farmer is bemused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_333.wav	4.01	To beat the European champion is quite nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_334.wav	3.97	However, the groups denied the claims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_335.wav	3.33	The airport was even different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_336.wav	2.52	There was no time scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_337.wav	2.95	Does that put pressure on us ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_338.wav	2.39	Did it work ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_339.wav	3.76	Do you think we are a top nation ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_340.wav	4.95	In his absence, the council adopted the change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_341.wav	3.21	It's just the way I play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_342.wav	4.10	The figures are bad, but not that bad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_343.wav	4.36	Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_344.wav	7.25	On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_345.wav	3.12	I have a moral dilemma.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_346.wav	2.48	It was almost too much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_347.wav	4.65	It will now be unveiled in the US in July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_348.wav	4.40	Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_349.wav	4.65	The idea was first mooted a year ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_350.wav	2.48	He did a good job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_351.wav	3.25	It's a policy which has worked for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_352.wav	3.59	It intends to do so on Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_353.wav	3.50	I think this proposal is excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_354.wav	4.66	The Allies intend to maintain the average.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_355.wav	3.03	He deserves a top team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_356.wav	3.63	It is all about having physical evidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_357.wav	2.95	It should be a great game, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_358.wav	2.90	I said she was very young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_359.wav	3.29	He had no previous convictions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_360.wav	4.05	Alex Ferguson is the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_361.wav	3.67	George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_362.wav	3.20	Neither woman has been named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_363.wav	3.12	They should take their mobile phones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_364.wav	3.33	You need a licence to run a pub.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_365.wav	2.39	I got a yellow card.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_366.wav	3.80	There will be no final dividend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_367.wav	3.37	I believe the gap is nearly there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_368.wav	4.44	The major championships will always have a special place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_369.wav	2.99	She said they would appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_370.wav	3.50	They were to blame for the first two goals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_371.wav	3.37	There is no deal as yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_372.wav	3.54	It's as wide as a church in here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_373.wav	3.67	The shares are a strong hold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_374.wav	2.78	It would be quite nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_375.wav	4.23	There was a thing in front of the camera.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_376.wav	3.50	The pair are very much in love.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_377.wav	3.72	Everything is now in place for Manchester.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_378.wav	4.82	We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_379.wav	4.23	No other job in world football can compare to this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_380.wav	4.27	I wanted to go out on a high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_381.wav	2.52	He has seen the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_382.wav	4.78	On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_383.wav	5.04	He has an equity stake in the investment house.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_384.wav	3.88	Our policy is very clear on this issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_385.wav	3.46	He has been a success this year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_386.wav	3.71	In fact, he was great today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_387.wav	4.10	Now, though, he has an incentive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_388.wav	3.12	A review is under way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_389.wav	2.95	It is a simple equation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_390.wav	3.03	We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_391.wav	3.03	I was as strong as a horse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_392.wav	2.95	I had a fortunate war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_393.wav	1.71	Are they free ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_394.wav	2.48	What are they for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_395.wav	2.69	Is there a waiting list ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_396.wav	3.76	Do they think anyone else wants them ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_397.wav	4.18	That investment has now been secured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_398.wav	2.95	He had returned to die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_399.wav	3.24	It is hard to understand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_400.wav	4.48	Adventure is the champagne of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_401.wav	6.62	Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_402.wav	3.67	Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_403.wav	3.41	The casualties were not named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_404.wav	4.52	However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_405.wav	2.48	It had been on the cards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_406.wav	3.12	He took a draw on his cigarette.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_407.wav	3.80	It was the same expression of joy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_408.wav	4.53	There is a solution, she believes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_409.wav	3.59	Yet the data is compelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_410.wav	3.67	That was a touch of class.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_411.wav	4.65	One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_412.wav	3.59	That is a personal matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_413.wav	3.76	He seems to be used to the attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_414.wav	3.33	We will stand for the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_415.wav	2.22	Is it worth it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_416.wav	2.18	Does it matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_417.wav	3.03	How do you take them away ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_418.wav	5.21	However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_419.wav	4.48	After the match, do you ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_420.wav	2.78	I am delighted for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_421.wav	4.31	Footballers have also been targeted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_422.wav	5.59	In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_423.wav	5.12	The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_424.wav	3.97	My aim is a top six finish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_425.wav	2.78	That's the way it works.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_426.wav	3.80	The professor is in no doubt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_427.wav	3.16	It was a poor performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_428.wav	4.61	This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_429.wav	3.59	John Daly has a burning ambition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_430.wav	3.37	Once again, they would be wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_431.wav	3.29	Together, we can make a difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_432.wav	3.71	He will be judged by his actions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_433.wav	4.10	It is an absolute nonsense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_434.wav	2.77	We might be back next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_435.wav	5.34	However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_436.wav	2.56	Size is not the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_437.wav	3.12	It was support as it should be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_438.wav	2.82	I didn't get to keep it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_439.wav	4.23	It is never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_440.wav	4.83	THE boy in The Sixth Sense is not alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_441.wav	3.50	He deserves a second chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_442.wav	3.07	It is pretty bad news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_443.wav	3.46	We just thought it would be kept under the carpet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_444.wav	3.97	Her body was found about four miles from the car.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_445.wav	3.84	We just got a phone call on Saturday night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_446.wav	4.35	But we have built a platform for next season.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_447.wav	2.73	I was embarrassed by it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_448.wav	5.29	That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_449.wav	2.86	She came to the Highland Show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_450.wav	5.04	Neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner-up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_451.wav	5.25	We have the location, which is assured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_452.wav	3.37	They were good years for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_453.wav	2.90	We're all paying for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_454.wav	3.55	This is the stuff of live music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_455.wav	4.44	She has now been registered as disabled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_456.wav	2.69	We could hardly believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_457.wav	2.99	The men are very worried.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_458.wav	3.07	Both promotions come as no surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_459.wav	3.08	We are going through the process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p281\p281_460.wav	4.18	It must never be seen as second class.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_002.wav	3.20	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_003.wav	6.87	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_004.wav	5.80	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_005.wav	5.93	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_006.wav	5.33	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_007.wav	4.78	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_008.wav	6.27	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_009.wav	5.38	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_010.wav	2.43	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_011.wav	8.02	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_012.wav	4.74	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_013.wav	4.36	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_014.wav	4.87	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_015.wav	5.25	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_016.wav	6.27	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_017.wav	12.03	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_018.wav	5.38	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_019.wav	6.91	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_020.wav	4.23	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_021.wav	8.62	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_022.wav	5.80	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_023.wav	10.88	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_024.wav	15.62	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_025.wav	2.65	But it failed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_026.wav	4.74	Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_027.wav	5.64	Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_028.wav	3.80	However, the following year the cancer returned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_029.wav	4.06	Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_030.wav	2.48	This is the window.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_031.wav	1.92	He was jailed for five years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_032.wav	2.10	Help is needed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_033.wav	2.77	Then, suddenly, they weren't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_034.wav	1.93	It is marvellous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_035.wav	4.31	Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_036.wav	3.46	However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_037.wav	2.39	They're just different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_038.wav	2.31	It was clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_039.wav	2.22	Indeed, he does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_040.wav	4.57	People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_041.wav	4.78	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_042.wav	2.69	Dancing was her life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_043.wav	3.67	The ambition this year is to improve on last.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_044.wav	4.27	It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_045.wav	2.52	They want to be entertained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_046.wav	2.39	It's the only thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_047.wav	3.16	You had better believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_048.wav	4.78	Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_049.wav	3.84	On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_050.wav	1.75	A neighbour said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_051.wav	2.18	It is bizarre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_052.wav	2.69	There is no reason at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_053.wav	4.53	In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_054.wav	3.08	Every aspect of our play was first class.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_055.wav	2.43	Our people are ready.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_056.wav	2.31	Here's a clue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_057.wav	2.26	I was lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_058.wav	3.72	For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_059.wav	3.37	My fitness was very poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_060.wav	4.44	Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_061.wav	2.22	It is unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_062.wav	2.74	I expect a rapid response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_063.wav	2.22	It happened so quickly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_064.wav	2.27	That's the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_065.wav	2.44	It seems to have worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_066.wav	2.56	This is the first step.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_067.wav	3.29	And if he hadn't become a musician?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_068.wav	4.06	There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_069.wav	4.65	I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_070.wav	2.91	But I've won both ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_071.wav	3.80	Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_072.wav	3.20	Robin Williams is very subdued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_073.wav	4.53	They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_074.wav	2.57	It could take some time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_075.wav	4.74	We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_076.wav	4.44	I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_077.wav	3.07	It is a job creation scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_078.wav	2.48	The party is up for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_079.wav	3.16	People must remain vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_080.wav	4.23	Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_081.wav	2.73	What has changed?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_082.wav	2.43	I will miss him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_083.wav	2.31	He is in the queue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_084.wav	3.03	I first met him last summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_085.wav	3.63	What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_086.wav	3.59	Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_087.wav	5.25	It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_088.wav	3.37	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_089.wav	4.22	The city council is a major property owner in the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_090.wav	4.57	Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_091.wav	3.59	Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_092.wav	2.73	We are on the path of change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_093.wav	3.84	This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_094.wav	5.25	Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_095.wav	2.69	Yet, it worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_096.wav	2.65	He's been hit by it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_097.wav	2.65	I love the Dome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_098.wav	3.07	I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_099.wav	4.18	However, we have not come to any conclusions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_100.wav	4.31	It is a love affair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_101.wav	4.10	Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_102.wav	3.20	They make a selective perception process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_103.wav	2.61	Two of the team became ill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_104.wav	2.18	That would be unlawful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_105.wav	2.48	I don't want to use it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_106.wav	2.69	Oil embargo endorsed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_107.wav	2.86	It was an adventure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_108.wav	4.95	Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_109.wav	3.20	While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_110.wav	4.06	According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_111.wav	3.37	I was fighting for my life, I thought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_112.wav	1.79	Is that right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_113.wav	3.12	He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_114.wav	2.09	It's a shame.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_115.wav	2.09	It was the eighties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_116.wav	1.58	It is so sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_117.wav	4.65	Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_118.wav	2.39	The mood is upbeat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_119.wav	2.13	It is rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_120.wav	2.48	Who would be a referee?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_121.wav	3.67	That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_122.wav	2.48	We enjoyed it today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_123.wav	3.89	His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_124.wav	3.97	Here, again, they were denied a voice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_125.wav	3.08	There were no grounds for his action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_126.wav	2.39	I'm so angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_127.wav	3.12	She really suffered for her art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_128.wav	4.10	It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_129.wav	2.65	It is not a U-turn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_130.wav	2.69	No production was achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_131.wav	2.48	I am now unemployed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_132.wav	3.50	We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_133.wav	2.73	It plans to return to this field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_134.wav	3.46	We work well together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_135.wav	3.97	The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_136.wav	4.61	We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_137.wav	4.35	Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_138.wav	2.44	I was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_139.wav	2.95	I don't know the full story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_140.wav	4.10	Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_141.wav	2.91	She died at her home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_142.wav	3.54	He realises his mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_143.wav	4.40	He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_144.wav	4.61	Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_145.wav	2.90	I was awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_146.wav	2.48	Who would have?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_147.wav	5.25	He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_148.wav	2.73	It is not just about pay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_149.wav	4.70	It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_150.wav	3.59	There was a substantial explosion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_151.wav	2.52	I was stunned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_152.wav	4.82	The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_153.wav	3.54	The weather forecast isn't good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_154.wav	2.73	They have not been named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_155.wav	4.31	She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_156.wav	3.12	My Dad is a hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_157.wav	4.70	For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_158.wav	2.73	Words were not required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_159.wav	3.80	The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_160.wav	3.29	Life becomes a song.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_161.wav	3.07	Well, he should know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_162.wav	3.12	Was this element always there?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_163.wav	2.99	These days are long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_164.wav	3.03	I'd love to be like Peter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_165.wav	3.12	I've put my own money into this project.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_166.wav	2.48	It has to be now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_167.wav	4.31	Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_168.wav	3.89	I was in the train station overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_169.wav	3.16	We have a budget in March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_170.wav	3.29	We should do everything at a stroke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_171.wav	2.60	You had to go and see him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_172.wav	4.36	It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_173.wav	2.56	In a way he was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_174.wav	3.54	They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_175.wav	2.86	Blair's response was weak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_176.wav	2.43	As we worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_177.wav	3.37	We are the gateway to justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_178.wav	4.05	I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_179.wav	2.18	The goals were good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_180.wav	3.97	Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_181.wav	1.92	It's an idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_182.wav	3.93	It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_183.wav	2.95	They need to look after themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_184.wav	4.23	I saw military vehicles in the distance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_185.wav	4.61	Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_186.wav	2.22	Does this matter?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_187.wav	3.07	Our team is just so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_188.wav	3.29	Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_189.wav	4.70	However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_190.wav	3.20	It caused a lot of upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_191.wav	5.51	But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_192.wav	2.91	We speak about the performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_193.wav	2.48	It is a farce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_194.wav	2.73	Peace was won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_195.wav	2.01	It's a fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_196.wav	2.65	I came home by ambulance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_197.wav	4.78	It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_198.wav	2.95	Is that success?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_199.wav	4.61	I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_200.wav	2.82	Who will pay for this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_201.wav	3.25	It's all about money, money, money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_202.wav	3.42	Sadly, it can't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_203.wav	2.69	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_204.wav	4.18	After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_205.wav	3.16	We have an election in eight days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_206.wav	2.44	Feel the heat?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_207.wav	4.53	The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_208.wav	3.59	Twaddle is a case in point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_209.wav	2.65	It had all been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_210.wav	5.42	IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_211.wav	2.44	Work has started.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_212.wav	3.46	The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_213.wav	4.65	On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_214.wav	4.95	The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_215.wav	4.61	Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_216.wav	4.53	This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_217.wav	3.20	Then another one came.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_218.wav	3.85	The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_219.wav	2.99	If it doesn't, it doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_220.wav	3.07	Clearly, the stakes are high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_221.wav	5.12	It's a question of creating a future awareness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_222.wav	3.76	I'd never seen a play about me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_223.wav	3.37	It's not before time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_224.wav	3.29	I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_225.wav	4.18	I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_226.wav	4.10	I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_227.wav	5.98	Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_228.wav	3.76	My wife and family are the support system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_229.wav	4.61	Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_230.wav	4.27	Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_231.wav	2.99	We are so proud.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_232.wav	4.01	The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_233.wav	3.08	Of course I was tempted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_234.wav	2.14	It's quite a line-up!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_235.wav	4.53	On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_236.wav	3.24	The minister is the engineer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_237.wav	4.36	I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_238.wav	2.44	It is hard won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_239.wav	2.39	Our policy is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_240.wav	3.84	I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_241.wav	3.03	The scene is about this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_242.wav	4.69	In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_243.wav	3.46	My son was too young to die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_244.wav	4.27	In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_245.wav	4.40	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_246.wav	2.14	It was a hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_247.wav	4.22	Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_248.wav	3.50	That could be in place by next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_249.wav	4.70	For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_250.wav	4.06	It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_251.wav	3.93	That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_252.wav	2.44	they fail to engage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_253.wav	3.89	It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_254.wav	4.83	One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_255.wav	3.29	They must play for each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_256.wav	5.89	However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_257.wav	3.42	There's not much money in cycling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_258.wav	4.14	This court has made an order which has not been observed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_259.wav	4.70	George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_260.wav	4.53	That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_261.wav	3.63	He has not created a Festival resource.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_262.wav	5.80	He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_263.wav	4.27	He was also married with two children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_264.wav	4.14	It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_265.wav	4.23	Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_266.wav	3.64	Our objective is to tackle poverty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_267.wav	2.74	One knows the feeling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_268.wav	5.29	Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_269.wav	5.47	The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_270.wav	4.19	She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_271.wav	3.46	She failed in her action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_272.wav	4.27	He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_273.wav	3.37	She looked so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_274.wav	4.19	In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_275.wav	3.46	It's so awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_276.wav	5.12	Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_277.wav	4.74	There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_278.wav	3.33	You've got to have both sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_279.wav	4.19	Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_280.wav	2.73	Dialogue is the key.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_281.wav	4.31	They have shown a great desire and attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_282.wav	3.76	She is an expert on medical ethics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_283.wav	2.35	Who will perform?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_284.wav	3.67	This is a national crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_285.wav	3.50	Who did the recruiting?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_286.wav	3.29	She is really magic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_287.wav	5.17	That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_288.wav	3.03	I was the sheep.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_289.wav	4.23	I was brought up in a mining background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_290.wav	5.51	In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_291.wav	2.95	Nothing is safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_292.wav	2.95	But it's a subtle process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_293.wav	2.86	One was a lawyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_294.wav	5.21	The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_295.wav	5.34	A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_296.wav	2.82	They are wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_297.wav	3.20	Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_298.wav	3.20	There were no passengers on board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_299.wav	2.48	It could work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_300.wav	4.70	This is a war over our home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_301.wav	5.25	Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_302.wav	2.56	There's no evidence he was ever there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_303.wav	2.05	You should be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_304.wav	5.21	However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_305.wav	3.76	The letters are going out today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_306.wav	3.63	Is there on his hands?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_307.wav	4.57	The Premier League has been a huge success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_308.wav	5.50	Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_309.wav	3.50	She is very distinctive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_310.wav	3.76	We have got to get the points from this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_311.wav	3.54	You may have a short memory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_312.wav	3.03	Henman has been warned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_313.wav	2.99	We are in the end game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_314.wav	1.92	It will work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_315.wav	3.67	I came into this world with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_316.wav	3.76	They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_317.wav	3.12	Our message was inclusive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_318.wav	4.95	But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_319.wav	4.06	Feel the air, the space.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_320.wav	3.54	Is there a new way forward?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_321.wav	5.68	We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_322.wav	4.74	The figures are bad, but not that bad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_323.wav	4.48	Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_324.wav	4.44	However, they will only be found in the wild.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_325.wav	5.89	The same things will happen with GM foods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_326.wav	5.98	Three years ago he would have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_327.wav	4.65	That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_328.wav	4.44	Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_329.wav	3.93	Two people were interviewed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_330.wav	4.27	I've got no secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_331.wav	4.06	We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_332.wav	3.29	This is a friendly match?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_333.wav	5.80	A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_334.wav	6.83	This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_335.wav	3.25	They should take their mobile phones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_336.wav	4.86	He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_337.wav	6.28	A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_338.wav	5.97	Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_339.wav	2.44	She is free.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_340.wav	3.76	Both of those promises have already been honoured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_341.wav	3.71	Tyson is overwhelmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_342.wav	4.31	In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_343.wav	4.44	Yet he left a few days later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_344.wav	4.65	It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_345.wav	3.88	As, indeed, they would be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_346.wav	4.14	It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_347.wav	4.74	Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_348.wav	5.46	To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_349.wav	4.95	The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_350.wav	2.73	That would help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_351.wav	2.27	My husband was angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_352.wav	5.29	Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_353.wav	2.65	And he laughs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_354.wav	4.57	He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_355.wav	2.86	This is a club on the rise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_356.wav	3.89	It's not pretty, but it's effective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_357.wav	2.69	Their time has gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_358.wav	2.52	He could make it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_359.wav	3.54	The death rates are still as high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_360.wav	3.24	Now, though, he has an incentive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_361.wav	4.87	Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_362.wav	4.14	This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_363.wav	3.67	It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_364.wav	2.61	It is a simple equation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_365.wav	3.97	By that time, however, it was already too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_366.wav	2.82	It was a funny game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_367.wav	2.78	There wasn't a goal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_368.wav	4.78	Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_369.wav	3.50	Colour was at the core of his life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p282\p282_370.wav	3.63	He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_001.wav	2.99	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_002.wav	3.88	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_003.wav	7.25	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_004.wav	6.19	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_005.wav	6.36	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_006.wav	5.80	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_007.wav	4.53	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_008.wav	7.34	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_009.wav	4.48	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_010.wav	3.20	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_011.wav	6.87	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_012.wav	4.95	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_013.wav	5.17	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_014.wav	4.83	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_015.wav	7.68	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_016.wav	7.72	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_017.wav	4.40	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_018.wav	5.85	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_019.wav	8.79	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_020.wav	5.72	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_021.wav	9.13	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_022.wav	6.83	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_023.wav	11.82	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_024.wav	6.79	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_025.wav	3.93	That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_026.wav	2.48	We are a service industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_027.wav	2.61	It's not going to work out that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_028.wav	2.65	The idea is not new.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_029.wav	2.56	Because we do not need it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_030.wav	2.82	And we have a singer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_031.wav	3.67	Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_032.wav	2.90	We speak about the performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_033.wav	5.63	It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_034.wav	3.29	Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_035.wav	2.43	It could well be the case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_036.wav	3.42	It is not for any other purpose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_037.wav	2.78	That means an extra two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_038.wav	3.07	You must always attempt to raise the bar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_039.wav	2.82	He is believed to live in Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_040.wav	3.41	Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_041.wav	2.99	She hopes to study in Britain one day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_042.wav	2.31	The boy is no longer with us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_043.wav	3.72	There's been a wake up call for the sector this week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_044.wav	3.71	But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_045.wav	2.99	Among them are many criminals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_046.wav	3.20	I was released after six days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_047.wav	3.80	The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_048.wav	3.55	Every aspect of our play was first class.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_049.wav	3.16	No details of the talks were given.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_050.wav	2.86	Clearly, they had other problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_051.wav	4.01	It also opened a branch in Livingston.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_052.wav	3.25	I would say the position is open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_053.wav	2.91	That was the theory, anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_054.wav	3.08	I had come back from London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_055.wav	2.86	I was inspired by two things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_056.wav	3.42	For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_057.wav	2.69	There was no safety net.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_058.wav	2.78	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_059.wav	2.09	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_060.wav	2.35	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_061.wav	2.73	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_062.wav	2.31	What do we do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_063.wav	3.21	He also presented You Bet!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_064.wav	3.54	Inspiring public confidence is crucial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_065.wav	2.65	I expect a rapid response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_066.wav	2.86	We felt it was sufficient.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_067.wav	2.69	This is the year of the Tiger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_068.wav	3.37	The motive for the shooting was not known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_069.wav	3.07	We believe a third party was involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_070.wav	2.35	The Government should be ashamed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_071.wav	2.65	There's still plenty time left.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_072.wav	2.86	You do not change overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_073.wav	4.44	There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_074.wav	4.19	Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_075.wav	2.69	We will pay their bills.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_076.wav	3.03	He is a young man with a new deal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_077.wav	3.84	He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_078.wav	3.67	Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_079.wav	2.82	It is very special for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_080.wav	3.37	The tournament has now been cancelled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_081.wav	4.01	They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_082.wav	4.10	We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_083.wav	3.37	The girls are so lucky to be alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_084.wav	5.08	Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_085.wav	2.57	The result is a vacuum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_086.wav	2.39	It looks like a hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_087.wav	2.82	I'd like to see the business case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_088.wav	3.16	It makes for an interesting conference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_089.wav	2.99	I've had it for the exams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_090.wav	2.69	You have to respect the office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_091.wav	2.65	He has been a success this year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_092.wav	2.94	By then, he was walking on water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_093.wav	2.57	We have to offer value for money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_094.wav	2.01	It's so hard to shift.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_095.wav	2.14	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_096.wav	2.26	Potions said he would drive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_097.wav	2.09	The trick is to try it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_098.wav	2.18	Little is known about them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_099.wav	2.56	However, it did not end that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_100.wav	3.20	It really was an unusual award.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_101.wav	4.14	IT has been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_102.wav	4.14	The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_103.wav	2.73	We could not get any possession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_104.wav	2.39	That is the important thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_105.wav	1.97	Why do it otherwise ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_106.wav	3.20	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_107.wav	2.22	So, did she meet him ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_108.wav	2.74	So what is the campaign about ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_109.wav	1.67	And does it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_110.wav	3.84	However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_111.wav	2.35	It's good to have a voice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_112.wav	3.29	However, we have not come to any conclusions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_113.wav	3.03	There is a contract in existence for Allan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_114.wav	2.31	Their attitude is all wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_115.wav	3.20	We made a world record together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_116.wav	4.48	A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_117.wav	3.24	It's for that reason he should resign.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_118.wav	2.86	There were no grounds for his action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_119.wav	2.65	It's been a long wait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_120.wav	3.50	There is no credible official announcement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_121.wav	2.35	Our house was very small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_122.wav	3.63	While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_123.wav	4.74	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_124.wav	3.42	Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_125.wav	2.09	Sport is good for you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_126.wav	3.37	It was won on the issue of the land.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_127.wav	1.79	I am a committed European.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_128.wav	2.99	From it emerged a cup.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_129.wav	2.22	That was the first step.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_130.wav	2.43	That might help a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_131.wav	2.94	It is a delight on every level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_132.wav	2.43	We would make a start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_133.wav	4.31	Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_134.wav	2.52	Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_135.wav	3.33	They keep the atmosphere in mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_136.wav	3.33	It does not even have a staff shortage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_137.wav	3.03	This should begin in October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_138.wav	3.54	However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_139.wav	2.35	We did what we had to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_140.wav	2.86	If not, a deal could take many months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_141.wav	2.77	But it is different in different regions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_142.wav	2.65	Last night, the row continued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_143.wav	2.43	You've got to be vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_144.wav	2.56	Glasgow is a friendly city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_145.wav	2.86	We are entirely happy with Russell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_146.wav	2.52	It's not a U-turn at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_147.wav	3.54	And I have some advice for my old friend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_148.wav	3.12	He was a home referee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_149.wav	2.52	Before it was an ordeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_150.wav	3.97	I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_151.wav	3.59	In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_152.wav	2.82	I'm so grateful for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_153.wav	2.78	It will be retained as part of the group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_154.wav	3.33	Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_155.wav	3.72	Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_156.wav	2.69	I am just trying to do my job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_157.wav	3.37	It opens the door to the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_158.wav	2.91	It has become a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_159.wav	2.94	I was caught out a little bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_160.wav	3.33	This will secure the future of our industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_161.wav	4.44	The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_162.wav	3.46	The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_163.wav	3.33	There's only one team in Ayrshire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_164.wav	2.78	What happened in that game ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_165.wav	2.13	Are you going to win ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_166.wav	2.74	Was it the wife ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_167.wav	1.80	Why change it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_168.wav	3.29	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_169.wav	2.65	It has to be an event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_170.wav	2.74	Three hours later, the man was free.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_171.wav	2.73	We have a clean bill of health.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_172.wav	2.74	It was by the numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_173.wav	3.08	Today I had no failures in my team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_174.wav	2.39	My Dad is a hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_175.wav	3.89	This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_176.wav	2.30	He was asked to quit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_177.wav	2.65	There is no reason at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_178.wav	2.31	The woman was his wife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_179.wav	2.99	This action reflects a slump in bookings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_180.wav	2.22	They should stop the bombing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_181.wav	2.22	The research was my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_182.wav	2.31	I'd love to be like Peter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_183.wav	4.01	The suspension of the head teacher has been lifted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_184.wav	2.05	I am a good player.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_185.wav	2.77	He was in great spirits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_186.wav	2.69	It's never great to finish second.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_187.wav	2.61	We have a budget in March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_188.wav	3.46	Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_189.wav	2.48	Nobody did in those days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_190.wav	3.16	Well, this article is a bit like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_191.wav	2.61	It's nice to be nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_192.wav	3.76	The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_193.wav	2.65	There was no hint of scandal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_194.wav	2.56	It was to be inclusive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_195.wav	3.07	I feel like my game has come a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_196.wav	2.82	The Hibs manager is no fool.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_197.wav	4.14	The expansion will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_198.wav	3.76	If that's the case, he will struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_199.wav	2.60	The hotel was now for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_200.wav	3.03	I'm just going to hit the shot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_201.wav	2.43	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_202.wav	2.56	how do you get it back ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_203.wav	2.69	What are you not good at ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_204.wav	2.61	I think, therefore I am ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_205.wav	1.88	Who was she ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_206.wav	4.31	Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_207.wav	3.07	They receive a high profile in the media.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_208.wav	3.12	They bought the property four years ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_209.wav	2.39	She was married with one son.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_210.wav	2.86	They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_211.wav	3.29	A copy of the report will be sent to the them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_212.wav	2.95	We are not making any comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_213.wav	3.20	It could be done by experts and lawyers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_214.wav	2.65	He lives in a neighbouring village.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_215.wav	3.12	It was a bit like having children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_216.wav	2.99	But there's an upturn in the sector.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_217.wav	3.16	I will work on her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_218.wav	3.84	We represent a wide range of society.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_219.wav	2.86	We always felt we could win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_220.wav	3.67	This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_221.wav	2.65	They are still very quiet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_222.wav	3.16	Pulled a huge number of viewers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_223.wav	2.90	I came home by ambulance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_224.wav	3.08	It comes from reflection or thinking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_225.wav	3.76	It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_226.wav	1.92	You could feel the heat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_227.wav	2.09	I suggest a new plan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_228.wav	2.48	That is the real test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_229.wav	4.40	Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_230.wav	2.78	The early physical reports were clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_231.wav	3.42	Consumers have the right to choose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_232.wav	3.63	The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_233.wav	2.91	This is a holy place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_234.wav	3.37	The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_235.wav	2.14	This will take several weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_236.wav	4.06	The research is published in the journal, Nature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_237.wav	3.03	We have an election in eight days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_238.wav	3.50	January is a bad time of year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_239.wav	4.14	HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_240.wav	3.76	I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_241.wav	4.36	The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_242.wav	2.35	I had relied on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_243.wav	2.56	I'm just a regular person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_244.wav	2.91	It was finally agreed on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_245.wav	2.10	It was a great experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_246.wav	2.69	His second was a beauty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_247.wav	2.73	These will take a little time to develop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_248.wav	2.61	There's a chance they might come down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_249.wav	2.73	This is an exciting time for the party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_250.wav	4.23	For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_251.wav	3.50	The problem was you thought you were a big man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_252.wav	2.09	It was a crazy day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_253.wav	2.99	A career as a doctor is on hold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_254.wav	2.26	Our future is in their hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_255.wav	3.88	This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_256.wav	2.73	It could be to do with the location.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_257.wav	2.91	We played them off the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_258.wav	3.16	If it doesn't, it doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_259.wav	3.46	A small number of new jobs will also be created.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_260.wav	2.65	At the time, he was a living legend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_261.wav	3.16	My wife and family are the support system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_262.wav	2.65	They have not been in touch with the club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_263.wav	3.37	He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_264.wav	2.82	She claimed the day was for young people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_265.wav	3.16	It depends on Labour, not on us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_266.wav	2.69	It had so much to do with output.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_267.wav	2.48	She died in middle age.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_268.wav	2.39	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_269.wav	2.48	was everything done to save people ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_270.wav	2.77	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_271.wav	2.90	Do I think about them often ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_272.wav	2.69	Is it in the right place ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_273.wav	1.79	Did he trip ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_274.wav	2.61	That takes a lot of courage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_275.wav	3.16	On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_276.wav	2.52	The irony was not lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_277.wav	3.12	I would do away with the dress code.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_278.wav	2.73	Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_279.wav	2.78	The minister is the engineer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_280.wav	3.37	After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_281.wav	2.52	It might be sad, but it's a fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_282.wav	2.73	Kingfisher can afford to wait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_283.wav	2.95	Nato was not a love affair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_284.wav	2.90	You can never tell with the manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_285.wav	2.69	We need to establish the facts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_286.wav	2.99	Persuaded to change his mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_287.wav	3.54	There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_288.wav	2.86	Paterson can afford to be generous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_289.wav	2.22	My son was too young to die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_290.wav	3.33	I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_291.wav	2.27	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_292.wav	2.56	My office is down there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_293.wav	2.95	None of the agencies was able to help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_294.wav	2.82	I told you I was ill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_295.wav	2.65	We accept the new rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_296.wav	2.43	He looked like a schoolboy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_297.wav	3.20	They are very keen to work with us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_298.wav	4.31	This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_299.wav	3.16	The next month is very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_300.wav	2.60	I would have the hammer in the crowd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_301.wav	2.91	This is a total mystery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_302.wav	2.78	At first I thought I was gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_303.wav	3.46	It is the end of an adventure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_304.wav	4.10	It has the potential to be another North Sea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_305.wav	3.03	It looks as though he will be right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_306.wav	3.50	As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_307.wav	3.12	It was an easy decision to come here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_308.wav	3.37	The target is to break even by Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_309.wav	4.01	Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_310.wav	2.31	My whole life has changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_311.wav	2.82	It was never a free kick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_312.wav	2.95	It further expressed his defiance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_313.wav	2.14	He said he was sorry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_314.wav	4.27	It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_315.wav	3.59	The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_316.wav	3.11	We have to be very, very careful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_317.wav	4.31	It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_318.wav	3.03	If not, he should go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_319.wav	3.29	He is well respected by his colleagues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_320.wav	3.20	Hopefully, this week will be good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_321.wav	2.56	This is the correct decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_322.wav	3.76	Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_323.wav	2.90	The Project is far from that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_324.wav	2.01	What form did that take ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_326.wav	2.48	What are they for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_327.wav	2.13	Is there a waiting list ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_328.wav	3.50	Do they think anyone else wants them ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_329.wav	2.35	So what happens next ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_330.wav	3.12	He will address the nation this evening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_331.wav	2.65	The attacker died in the crash.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_332.wav	3.59	We would hope to make progress on that next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_333.wav	2.35	No final decision has been taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_334.wav	3.03	In Europe, it is always over two games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_335.wav	2.69	I was there five months ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_336.wav	2.09	Well, he can do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_337.wav	2.48	The songs are just so good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_338.wav	2.43	And it's a goodbye from him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_339.wav	2.90	We need to increase the membership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_340.wav	2.22	A new school will be built.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_341.wav	4.48	This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_342.wav	2.69	The capital costs are modest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_343.wav	2.44	It became a book by itself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_344.wav	2.82	Cast Away now on general release.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_345.wav	3.33	Like many companies, it is a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_346.wav	2.73	The party lasted all night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_347.wav	2.99	But I think it's different from the rest!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_348.wav	2.52	It is a matter of clarity.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_349.wav	2.91	He did that every night I was with him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_350.wav	2.27	They come to enjoy themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_351.wav	3.25	Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_352.wav	3.03	Another reason is a shortage of stock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_353.wav	2.09	And he goes with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_354.wav	2.52	My life is exactly the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_356.wav	3.80	He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_357.wav	2.39	We want to play at the worlds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_358.wav	2.78	We will listen to any suggestion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_359.wav	2.86	The Premier League has been a huge success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_360.wav	3.33	Public opinion was split on the proposal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_361.wav	4.14	It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_362.wav	2.52	In the old days, it was easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_363.wav	2.95	They were impressive against France.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_364.wav	2.73	The airport was even different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_365.wav	4.06	The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_366.wav	2.61	He was at school in Devon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_367.wav	2.39	I'd like to take the plunge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_368.wav	2.22	I have a moral dilemma.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_369.wav	2.43	Last weekend he was awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_370.wav	2.31	There is a range of employers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_371.wav	2.95	I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_372.wav	2.60	Ferguson is a good example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_373.wav	2.82	But they have taken the lesson to heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_374.wav	2.77	The Allies intend to maintain the average.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_375.wav	3.33	My mind is focused on the next four weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_376.wav	2.60	It should be a great game, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_377.wav	2.27	I said she was very young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_378.wav	2.86	He had no previous convictions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_379.wav	2.69	He was then replaced by Ross.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_380.wav	2.99	George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_381.wav	2.69	Had this been common practice ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_382.wav	2.78	What do they want us to do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_383.wav	1.71	Is it worth it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_384.wav	1.67	Does it matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_385.wav	3.80	That can be good for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_386.wav	2.43	I believe the gap is nearly there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_387.wav	3.88	But the main issue will be the sale of Burger King.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_388.wav	3.67	They were to blame for the first two goals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_389.wav	3.67	Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_390.wav	3.67	It's as wide as a church in here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_391.wav	2.52	It would be quite nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_392.wav	3.54	You must have a government and a good civil service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_393.wav	3.08	The pair are very much in love.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_394.wav	3.03	As, indeed, they would be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_395.wav	4.14	He has an equity stake in the investment house.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_396.wav	2.99	This is a club on the rise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_397.wav	3.12	We came across the first set of bodies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_398.wav	2.61	Theatre is not a museum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_399.wav	2.78	It has only been rumours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_400.wav	4.31	Final proposals will be published in February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_401.wav	2.26	I could not live with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_402.wav	2.78	The death rates are still as high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_403.wav	2.09	A review is under way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_404.wav	3.12	It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_405.wav	2.56	There is a lack of logic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_406.wav	3.03	That investment has now been secured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_407.wav	3.29	I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_408.wav	2.56	It proved a good decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_409.wav	2.52	Colour was at the core of his life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_410.wav	2.27	The BBC was a disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_411.wav	4.06	Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_412.wav	3.16	But the foundations have been laid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_413.wav	3.33	I was Scottish on the basis of my family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_414.wav	2.61	I was shaking on the blocks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_415.wav	3.41	They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_416.wav	3.50	I remain a buyer of the shares.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_417.wav	2.65	The second goal was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_418.wav	2.05	That's all I can say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_419.wav	2.18	How do you take them away ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_420.wav	3.07	However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_421.wav	2.18	After the match, do you ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_422.wav	2.56	I am astonished at attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_423.wav	2.43	I was pleased with my own game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_424.wav	4.23	Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_425.wav	2.52	Yet the data is compelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_426.wav	2.82	No date has been set for a meeting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_427.wav	3.55	One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_428.wav	2.43	That is a personal matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_429.wav	2.30	I'm pleased about one thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_430.wav	2.86	My aim is a top six finish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_431.wav	2.78	These guys are looking for business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_432.wav	2.56	He is on the wrong side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_433.wav	2.18	I would rather look at him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_434.wav	2.22	It needs to be volatile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_435.wav	3.12	Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_436.wav	3.33	It is based on a true story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_437.wav	2.69	But, in fact, the reverse is true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_438.wav	3.20	Being with me is an honour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_439.wav	3.12	He will be judged by his actions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_440.wav	2.35	Which may be the same thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_441.wav	2.95	We know about the crisis in cattle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_442.wav	2.22	We shall not forget him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_443.wav	3.12	I can almost pretend to be Scottish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_444.wav	2.95	Everything in golf is a balance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_445.wav	3.59	THE boy in The Sixth Sense is not alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_446.wav	3.84	Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_447.wav	2.60	Something has got to give.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_448.wav	3.93	Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_449.wav	3.67	If we were offered The Scotsman I would buy it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_450.wav	2.86	We went straight into the bedroom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_451.wav	3.16	I do not see it as some kind of reward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_452.wav	3.76	But we have built a platform for next season.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_453.wav	2.44	I was embarrassed by it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_454.wav	3.67	That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_455.wav	4.36	They had learned from the lessons of the first game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_456.wav	3.29	First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_457.wav	2.48	I'd never run for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_458.wav	2.56	She came to the Highland Show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_459.wav	2.61	He was confronted by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_460.wav	4.06	I am greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_461.wav	3.37	She has reached the top of her profession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_462.wav	2.82	Let that be their memorial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_463.wav	3.12	This morning I got a call from my wife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_464.wav	3.20	She has now been registered as disabled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_465.wav	3.29	The move is considered a major breakthrough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_466.wav	3.55	The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_467.wav	3.29	It all began as an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_468.wav	2.61	We are going through the process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_469.wav	3.25	Ms Jackson was not present to put her case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_470.wav	3.33	City sentiment is in his favour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p283\p283_471.wav	3.33	It's been a long, long journey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_001.wav	2.56	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_002.wav	4.44	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_003.wav	5.76	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_004.wav	3.89	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_005.wav	5.38	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_006.wav	4.40	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_007.wav	3.71	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_008.wav	6.32	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_009.wav	4.19	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_010.wav	2.44	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_011.wav	5.38	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_012.wav	3.97	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_013.wav	3.67	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_014.wav	3.75	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_015.wav	5.42	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_016.wav	5.98	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_017.wav	3.29	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_018.wav	4.57	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_019.wav	6.79	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_020.wav	3.71	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_021.wav	7.90	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_022.wav	5.89	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_023.wav	9.99	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_024.wav	8.28	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.It's nice to hear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_025.wav	4.61	Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_026.wav	1.75	We will be homeless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_027.wav	1.79	Is this accurate?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_028.wav	3.08	I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_029.wav	2.09	They have no history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_030.wav	3.59	Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_031.wav	2.18	I'd just like to play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_032.wav	2.09	There's a story, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_033.wav	1.79	This is the window.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_034.wav	4.36	Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_035.wav	4.18	We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_036.wav	2.31	Then, suddenly, they weren't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_037.wav	2.05	It's a fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_038.wav	3.75	Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_039.wav	3.07	However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_040.wav	3.97	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_041.wav	2.39	Dancing was her life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_042.wav	3.74	It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_043.wav	2.22	We will push.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_044.wav	4.35	The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_045.wav	2.95	Among them are many criminals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_046.wav	1.54	It is marvellous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_047.wav	3.03	Every aspect of our play was first class.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_048.wav	1.75	Our people are ready.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_049.wav	1.54	Here's a clue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_050.wav	3.03	Her body was found about four miles from the car.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_051.wav	2.31	I was inspired by two things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_052.wav	2.82	For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_053.wav	2.52	My fitness was very poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_054.wav	2.05	Sadly, it can't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_055.wav	3.50	He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_056.wav	2.44	I expect a rapid response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_057.wav	2.35	What was the main difference?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_058.wav	1.80	There's a danger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_059.wav	3.54	We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_060.wav	3.80	Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_061.wav	5.16	George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_062.wav	1.96	It's that kind of place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_063.wav	1.96	They are real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_064.wav	2.95	I've spent a lot of time on buses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_065.wav	4.78	Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_066.wav	2.35	And if he hadn't become a musician?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_067.wav	2.44	That was a gold medal for certain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_068.wav	1.92	We should have known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_069.wav	2.86	Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_070.wav	2.61	Robin Williams is very subdued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_071.wav	2.05	He was at home with his pals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_072.wav	1.80	It was magic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_073.wav	4.14	Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_074.wav	3.55	The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_075.wav	2.26	Is there a new way forward?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_076.wav	1.92	The party is up for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_077.wav	1.97	Even the one she loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_078.wav	2.82	People must remain vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_079.wav	2.27	Today she has been released.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_080.wav	1.92	Who will pay for this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_081.wav	2.44	He had taken everything from me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_082.wav	2.82	He seems to be pleased with the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_083.wav	2.52	By then, he was walking on water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_084.wav	1.97	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_085.wav	4.18	The city council is a major property owner in the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_086.wav	4.48	Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_087.wav	2.73	Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_088.wav	1.71	It is a lifeline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_089.wav	3.08	They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_090.wav	3.12	This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_091.wav	2.52	She is an expert on medical ethics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_092.wav	3.50	That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_093.wav	2.18	Then came the crunch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_094.wav	1.67	It is annoying.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_095.wav	1.84	I love the Dome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_096.wav	3.88	We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_097.wav	2.13	I am extremely sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_098.wav	1.79	It is a love affair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_099.wav	4.53	However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_100.wav	2.78	May not have been at fault?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_101.wav	1.96	They tried to deny it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_102.wav	3.12	They make a selective perception process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_103.wav	4.83	Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_104.wav	1.92	That's all right then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_105.wav	2.48	Oil embargo endorsed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_106.wav	2.48	Before the game we went for a pint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_107.wav	2.48	She reflects a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_108.wav	4.74	Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_109.wav	3.37	While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_110.wav	1.80	It was a funny game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_111.wav	3.80	According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_112.wav	2.69	I was fighting for my life, I thought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_113.wav	2.09	It was the eighties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_114.wav	3.50	I did not see any reason to change the captain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_115.wav	2.31	It is so sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_116.wav	3.88	We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_117.wav	3.16	It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_118.wav	5.00	Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_119.wav	1.97	It is rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_120.wav	4.44	That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_121.wav	1.93	We enjoyed it today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_122.wav	4.18	We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_123.wav	2.48	There were no grounds for his action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_124.wav	2.86	I can't even get into the A team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_125.wav	2.95	She really suffered for her art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_126.wav	4.01	It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_127.wav	2.05	The people will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_128.wav	2.47	No production was achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_129.wav	3.29	She said she would not welcome the flowers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_130.wav	3.07	It plans to return to this field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_131.wav	4.57	Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_132.wav	3.97	Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_133.wav	4.23	On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_134.wav	4.44	We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_135.wav	3.46	I don't know the full story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_136.wav	3.55	It seems so long since I did the exams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_137.wav	4.52	And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_138.wav	2.86	It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_139.wav	1.71	I was awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_140.wav	2.18	The idea is simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_141.wav	3.37	That group reported just before Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_142.wav	5.38	He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_143.wav	2.86	It is not just about pay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_144.wav	2.39	Note the date.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_145.wav	2.22	So I got a blood test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_146.wav	3.97	The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_147.wav	4.19	But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_148.wav	2.18	The weather forecast isn't good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_149.wav	3.72	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_150.wav	4.95	The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_151.wav	2.14	I was on a roll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_152.wav	2.74	She had gone to the Catholic school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_153.wav	2.26	We are on a four-year mission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_154.wav	1.79	My Dad is a hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_155.wav	2.01	He was asked to quit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_156.wav	3.46	The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_157.wav	1.80	He can do no wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_158.wav	2.73	Was this element always there?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_159.wav	2.48	These days are long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_160.wav	3.25	It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_161.wav	5.59	Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_162.wav	2.48	They are not advertised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_163.wav	3.20	Seven people were later detained by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_164.wav	4.10	It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_165.wav	2.14	Again, we were lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_166.wav	2.35	They will do their own thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_167.wav	2.18	Does that put pressure on us?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_168.wav	2.65	One season, they might do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_169.wav	2.09	Is Saddam a threat?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_170.wav	1.75	As we worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_171.wav	4.01	However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_172.wav	4.40	It is not either national standards or local control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_173.wav	3.03	I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_174.wav	2.91	I'm just going to hit the shot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_175.wav	2.65	Everyone can be bought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_176.wav	4.31	Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_177.wav	1.97	I've been there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_178.wav	2.69	Four policemen were wounded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_179.wav	3.33	I saw military vehicles in the distance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_180.wav	3.46	The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_181.wav	3.16	What has caused the demise of singing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_182.wav	4.27	He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_183.wav	2.86	Our team is just so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_184.wav	3.97	I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_185.wav	1.92	It is a farce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_186.wav	1.97	Peace was won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_187.wav	4.40	It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_188.wav	2.48	I came home by ambulance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_189.wav	4.91	The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_190.wav	2.44	Is that success?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_191.wav	1.84	They are ready.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_192.wav	2.09	I have a cold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_193.wav	2.99	The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_194.wav	3.59	I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_195.wav	3.89	It's all about money, money, money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_196.wav	2.65	There was no safety net.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_197.wav	2.99	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_198.wav	3.59	It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_199.wav	4.27	After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_200.wav	2.48	There was an e-mail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_201.wav	3.03	Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_202.wav	2.26	I am delighted for Simon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_203.wav	2.09	It had all been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_204.wav	4.53	It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_205.wav	3.59	So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_206.wav	2.26	It's not ideal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_207.wav	2.95	In each case they were a goal down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_208.wav	3.16	However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_209.wav	2.39	I might come back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_210.wav	4.27	The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_211.wav	4.44	The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_212.wav	4.10	Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_213.wav	5.04	This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_214.wav	4.65	At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_215.wav	3.33	The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_216.wav	4.57	Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_217.wav	4.18	It's a question of creating a future awareness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_218.wav	2.18	It's not before time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_219.wav	3.03	I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_220.wav	2.82	The report is due out next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_221.wav	1.58	But she was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_222.wav	5.89	Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_223.wav	3.16	My wife and family are the support system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_224.wav	4.06	The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_225.wav	2.01	We were awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_226.wav	2.22	They tried to give her advice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_227.wav	2.86	The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_228.wav	3.24	The parties have been given until today to respond.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_229.wav	1.79	There is no excuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_230.wav	4.01	On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_231.wav	2.56	But it's a subtle process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_232.wav	3.97	The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_233.wav	2.09	The car was just there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_234.wav	2.52	The whole thing will be great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_235.wav	2.09	Our policy is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_236.wav	3.50	I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_237.wav	2.69	You can feel at home in China.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_238.wav	2.44	The scene is about this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_239.wav	4.19	The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_240.wav	2.65	It was a kind of contempt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_241.wav	3.67	In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_242.wav	3.37	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_243.wav	2.22	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_244.wav	2.14	It was a hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_245.wav	2.01	There's the mix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_246.wav	2.69	There will be widespread support on all sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_247.wav	2.61	Is there on his hands?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_248.wav	4.05	He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_249.wav	3.76	That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_250.wav	4.91	However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_251.wav	2.52	Chelsea was a great club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_252.wav	3.24	It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_253.wav	1.97	We have to expand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_254.wav	2.90	It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_255.wav	2.27	Is that a serious question?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_256.wav	2.13	They must play for each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_257.wav	3.76	However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_258.wav	2.52	There's not much money in cycling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_259.wav	3.67	This court has made an order which has not been observed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_260.wav	2.27	I am just trying to do my job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_261.wav	2.82	This is a question of Islam.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_262.wav	3.63	Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_263.wav	4.14	I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_264.wav	3.24	Frankly, we should all have such problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_265.wav	2.27	The system can work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_266.wav	1.88	We're in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_267.wav	2.65	Our objective is to tackle poverty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_268.wav	2.60	It's a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_269.wav	7.00	She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_270.wav	3.54	However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_271.wav	2.18	They seem to get away with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_272.wav	1.96	She looked so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_273.wav	4.01	His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_274.wav	4.61	Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_275.wav	2.78	If not, he should go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_276.wav	3.50	We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_277.wav	2.44	We are a grandmother.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_278.wav	3.76	There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_279.wav	2.61	You feel very helpless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_280.wav	3.89	This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_281.wav	3.76	What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_282.wav	2.91	He will address the nation this evening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_283.wav	3.50	They have shown a great desire and attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_284.wav	3.03	Maloney is an engaging talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_285.wav	3.97	The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_286.wav	2.43	This is a national crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_287.wav	2.48	Bombing slaughter rejected
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_288.wav	2.56	We are not going to forget.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_289.wav	2.56	No Briton has ever won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_290.wav	2.74	Painful, but only because it's true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_291.wav	4.78	He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_292.wav	2.43	The songs are just so good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_293.wav	2.52	And it's a goodbye from him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_294.wav	1.96	The goals will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_295.wav	1.84	Who can predict?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_296.wav	3.97	If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_297.wav	4.70	I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_298.wav	3.41	Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_299.wav	2.01	I was the sheep.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_300.wav	2.05	What has altered?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_301.wav	2.01	Nothing is safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_302.wav	1.96	One was a lawyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_303.wav	4.06	The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_304.wav	3.93	A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_305.wav	1.75	They are wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_306.wav	1.67	I can live with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_307.wav	1.54	Work has started.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_308.wav	3.67	In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_309.wav	4.35	The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_310.wav	1.49	You should be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_311.wav	2.18	The minister is the engineer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_312.wav	2.14	The letters are going out today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_313.wav	2.73	We want to play at the worlds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_314.wav	4.36	The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_315.wav	4.10	and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_316.wav	2.48	Special measures were needed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_317.wav	3.21	The Premier League has been a huge success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_318.wav	2.31	The show is at an end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_319.wav	2.14	Your father was a good man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_320.wav	2.65	Such actions are rarely popular.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_321.wav	3.29	We have got to get the points from this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_322.wav	3.42	The election is total confusion and chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_323.wav	2.61	Henman has been warned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_324.wav	1.75	I would love it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_325.wav	4.01	Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_326.wav	3.03	The problems began a long time ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_327.wav	2.99	For the moment, our position remains the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_328.wav	3.84	Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_329.wav	2.39	We are in the end game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_330.wav	4.02	They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_331.wav	1.88	There was no time scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_332.wav	4.06	But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_333.wav	2.60	It is a job creation scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_334.wav	2.90	Relief was beyond belief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_335.wav	4.70	On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_336.wav	3.80	Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_337.wav	5.16	Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_338.wav	2.44	Finally, he paid for the movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_339.wav	2.86	You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_340.wav	3.59	In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_341.wav	2.44	He was the architect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_342.wav	2.99	Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_343.wav	1.97	He has to learn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_344.wav	2.35	Two people were interviewed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_345.wav	2.09	I've got no secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_346.wav	2.26	This is a big advantage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_347.wav	1.79	I'm very lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_348.wav	2.52	A great deal has been achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_349.wav	3.55	Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_350.wav	4.01	A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_351.wav	4.99	This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_352.wav	2.73	They should take their mobile phones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_353.wav	3.33	Eight months later, he was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_354.wav	2.61	I HAVE a dream.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_355.wav	2.18	We have big ideas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_356.wav	3.25	Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_357.wav	2.39	I first met him last summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_358.wav	3.72	He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_359.wav	4.10	Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_360.wav	1.92	She is free.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_361.wav	3.07	You must have a government and a good civil service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_362.wav	2.78	Yet he left a few days later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_363.wav	2.69	The pair are very much in love.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_364.wav	4.19	It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_365.wav	4.65	To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_366.wav	2.60	Mentally, you have to be tough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_367.wav	3.76	It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_368.wav	2.99	There was a substantial explosion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_369.wav	2.18	Their time has gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_370.wav	3.71	All the investment is possible through the public sector.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_371.wav	2.35	They believed it worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_372.wav	3.58	For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_373.wav	4.14	The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_374.wav	2.86	Now, though, he has an incentive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_375.wav	3.67	They have not done so this season so far.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_376.wav	2.48	It is a simple equation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_377.wav	2.39	Clark is back on top form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_378.wav	2.01	There is no signature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_379.wav	2.65	The task is enormous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_380.wav	3.50	I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_381.wav	2.99	He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_382.wav	2.65	It is hard to understand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_383.wav	2.73	The Cabinet is split over the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_384.wav	1.79	I was lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_385.wav	1.84	Something is wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_386.wav	4.14	The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_387.wav	2.48	That's the name of the game, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_388.wav	2.26	It's like a car crash.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_389.wav	4.74	Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_390.wav	3.97	Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_391.wav	2.22	You had to go and see him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_392.wav	3.03	One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_393.wav	3.25	On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_394.wav	4.27	He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_395.wav	2.22	We try to keep it right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_396.wav	2.74	Stewart will travel with some confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_397.wav	2.86	Here, again, they were denied a voice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_398.wav	1.67	It can help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_399.wav	3.80	I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_400.wav	4.31	The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_401.wav	4.27	He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_402.wav	2.14	But we are a young side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_403.wav	4.02	By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_404.wav	3.29	So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_405.wav	2.18	It will take place in July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_406.wav	3.50	The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_407.wav	3.42	Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_408.wav	1.84	It is full-scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_409.wav	1.92	Then , he laughs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_410.wav	2.05	You know the sort of thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_411.wav	1.58	I knew the script.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_412.wav	1.49	It might be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_413.wav	2.35	Feel the air, the space.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_414.wav	2.27	He scored a touchdown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_415.wav	2.48	I believe the gap is nearly there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_416.wav	3.88	Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_417.wav	3.67	The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_418.wav	2.01	It is legally binding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_419.wav	2.60	Is there any prospect of this happening?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_420.wav	3.25	He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_421.wav	2.18	Eriksson would have approved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_422.wav	2.78	I've invented a village in East Lothian.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_423.wav	1.80	It was little else.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_424.wav	1.75	He is to appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p284\p284_425.wav	2.43	Nato will prevail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_001.wav	1.96	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_002.wav	3.80	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_003.wav	7.08	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_004.wav	4.66	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_005.wav	5.64	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_006.wav	5.38	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_007.wav	3.93	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_008.wav	6.92	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_009.wav	4.69	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_010.wav	3.33	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_011.wav	6.32	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_012.wav	4.70	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_013.wav	4.31	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_014.wav	4.91	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_015.wav	6.15	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_016.wav	6.15	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_017.wav	3.97	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_018.wav	5.38	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_019.wav	6.40	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_020.wav	3.67	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_021.wav	8.24	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_022.wav	6.19	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_023.wav	10.20	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_024.wav	7.00	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_025.wav	3.72	Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_026.wav	3.12	In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_027.wav	4.95	Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_028.wav	3.37	However, the following year the cancer returned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_029.wav	3.67	Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_030.wav	4.83	They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_031.wav	2.22	There's a story, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_032.wav	2.05	This is the window.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_033.wav	2.27	He was jailed for five years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_034.wav	4.35	Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_035.wav	4.01	They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_036.wav	4.23	It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_037.wav	2.09	They're just different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_038.wav	1.79	It was clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_039.wav	1.97	Indeed, he does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_040.wav	3.21	People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_041.wav	4.22	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_042.wav	2.30	Sure, it's funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_043.wav	2.43	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_044.wav	2.39	Is a drug dealer?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_045.wav	3.72	He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_046.wav	2.39	He looks like an Afghan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_047.wav	3.24	No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_048.wav	1.80	Here's a clue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_049.wav	1.54	I was lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_050.wav	1.62	It's a miracle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_051.wav	1.75	I love the Dome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_052.wav	2.05	There was no safety net.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_053.wav	4.06	This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_054.wav	1.88	That's the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_055.wav	2.82	We will treat it like a World Cup match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_056.wav	3.63	The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_057.wav	2.35	Scotland had great assets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_058.wav	2.18	It's that kind of place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_059.wav	1.79	They are real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_060.wav	3.76	There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_061.wav	1.71	We should have known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_062.wav	2.48	I was conceived in Aberdeen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_063.wav	2.56	Robin Williams is very subdued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_064.wav	2.52	The tournament has now been cancelled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_065.wav	2.18	There could be a way back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_066.wav	2.86	The death rates are still as high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_067.wav	2.09	I had my suspicions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_068.wav	3.12	I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_069.wav	4.40	I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_070.wav	2.48	Even the one she loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_071.wav	2.65	It's now down in black and white.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_072.wav	3.42	Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_073.wav	2.01	What has changed?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_074.wav	3.12	Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_075.wav	2.14	He is in the queue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_076.wav	1.67	He is driven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_077.wav	2.22	All options are open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_078.wav	1.58	I was too young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_079.wav	1.80	Someone who cares
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_080.wav	4.19	It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_081.wav	1.71	It is a blow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_082.wav	1.88	They lived for their children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_083.wav	1.71	It will be tight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_084.wav	2.22	This is the start of our season.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_085.wav	3.12	Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_086.wav	3.16	That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_087.wav	2.18	We knew they could do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_088.wav	1.63	But I was wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_089.wav	3.12	Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_090.wav	2.73	I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_091.wav	1.97	I saw the whole thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_092.wav	4.01	Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_093.wav	1.71	It was mayhem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_094.wav	2.31	Journalists should make him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_095.wav	1.92	It is a love affair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_096.wav	4.31	However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_097.wav	2.05	They tried to deny it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_098.wav	3.46	After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_099.wav	2.39	No, the equipment is extra.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_100.wav	2.48	We have an election in eight days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_101.wav	2.69	Oil embargo endorsed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_102.wav	2.82	For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_103.wav	1.92	She reflects a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_104.wav	2.35	It was an interesting thing to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_105.wav	2.65	While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_106.wav	3.12	She is believed to be in South Africa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_107.wav	2.56	I was fighting for my life, I thought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_108.wav	1.96	Is that right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_109.wav	2.82	He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_110.wav	1.92	It was the eighties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_111.wav	3.03	This gives a financial incentive to switch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_112.wav	1.80	It is so sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_113.wav	3.67	Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_114.wav	2.77	In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_115.wav	1.62	It is rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_116.wav	2.14	Who would be a referee?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_117.wav	2.01	We enjoyed it today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_118.wav	1.88	She does not want to speak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_119.wav	2.78	Here, again, they were denied a voice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_120.wav	2.26	There were no grounds for his action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_121.wav	2.31	It has removed a bit of guilt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_122.wav	2.22	She really suffered for her art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_123.wav	1.88	It is not a U-turn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_124.wav	2.52	Offered the gold medal, he declined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_125.wav	2.27	No production was achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_126.wav	2.91	He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_127.wav	2.01	I am now unemployed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_128.wav	2.14	We work well together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_129.wav	1.54	It's not true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_130.wav	3.25	Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_131.wav	3.46	Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_132.wav	3.97	It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_133.wav	3.20	He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_134.wav	3.97	If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_135.wav	3.03	It seems so long since I did the exams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_136.wav	3.50	Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_137.wav	3.71	We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_138.wav	1.75	Who would be right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_139.wav	3.80	Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_140.wav	1.75	I was awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_141.wav	3.07	That group reported just before Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_142.wav	4.10	Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_143.wav	2.48	IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_144.wav	3.20	The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_145.wav	3.46	The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_146.wav	2.14	The weather forecast isn't good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_147.wav	2.94	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_148.wav	1.79	I was on a roll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_149.wav	2.65	She had gone to the Catholic school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_150.wav	2.39	We are on a four-year mission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_151.wav	2.73	The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_152.wav	3.29	It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_153.wav	1.84	My Dad is a hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_154.wav	3.37	This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_155.wav	2.69	Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_156.wav	2.09	That includes the equipment?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_157.wav	2.14	Well, he should know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_158.wav	1.75	I will tell you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_159.wav	4.10	Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_160.wav	3.54	Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_161.wav	2.35	As, indeed, they would be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_162.wav	3.89	The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_163.wav	3.97	Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_164.wav	1.92	They are not advertised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_165.wav	1.97	Tell it like it was?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_166.wav	2.65	Seven people were later detained by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_167.wav	3.80	It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_168.wav	4.14	By then, however, both men were already in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_169.wav	1.97	I carried on for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_170.wav	1.80	He was a crazy man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_171.wav	2.74	They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_172.wav	2.18	One season, they might do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_173.wav	1.50	As we worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_174.wav	3.67	However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_175.wav	3.37	It is not either national standards or local control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_176.wav	1.88	My players are special.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_177.wav	2.22	I drove the ball well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_178.wav	3.85	The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_179.wav	1.67	The goals were good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_180.wav	2.14	His name was unknown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_181.wav	1.63	Nothing is safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_182.wav	3.93	And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_183.wav	2.01	Many innocent people will die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_184.wav	2.99	It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_185.wav	2.69	I saw military vehicles in the distance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_186.wav	2.65	The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_187.wav	3.29	What has caused the demise of singing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_188.wav	3.80	Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_189.wav	2.01	There is no openness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_190.wav	2.73	Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_191.wav	4.40	Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_192.wav	2.31	It caused a lot of upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_193.wav	3.42	I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_194.wav	1.33	It's a fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_195.wav	2.82	I came home by ambulance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_196.wav	3.89	The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_197.wav	2.60	We live by the rule of law.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_198.wav	2.74	The service from the other players was super.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_199.wav	3.93	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_200.wav	2.69	They've got three-quarters of the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_201.wav	2.22	Today was first class.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_202.wav	2.99	We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_203.wav	1.88	I don't want to use it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_204.wav	2.35	There was an e-mail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_205.wav	1.54	He knows a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_206.wav	2.09	Twaddle is a case in point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_207.wav	2.05	It's not before time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_208.wav	1.75	It's not ideal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_209.wav	2.10	We want to keep the pound.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_210.wav	2.39	In each case they were a goal down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_211.wav	3.42	However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_212.wav	3.71	On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_213.wav	3.97	The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_214.wav	2.48	People should make their own decisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_215.wav	3.03	The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_216.wav	2.44	Because they didn't want to know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_217.wav	2.99	That has been the easy part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_218.wav	4.19	He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_219.wav	2.99	At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_220.wav	2.65	If it doesn't, it doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_221.wav	2.35	I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_222.wav	2.27	Clearly, the stakes are high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_223.wav	3.84	It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_224.wav	3.16	He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_225.wav	1.58	But she was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_226.wav	2.65	At the time, he was a living legend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_227.wav	2.73	My wife and family are the support system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_228.wav	4.06	Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_229.wav	4.10	Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_230.wav	2.22	They tried to give her advice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_231.wav	3.03	The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_232.wav	2.99	Half of young people had had contact with the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_233.wav	2.09	Wealth is relative.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_234.wav	1.41	You should be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_235.wav	1.46	It's quite nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_236.wav	2.43	Three weeks later, he resigned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_237.wav	2.99	It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_238.wav	4.06	The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_239.wav	3.29	He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_240.wav	2.78	In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_241.wav	3.29	If we lose the doctor it would be the last straw.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_242.wav	4.19	We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_243.wav	3.97	I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_244.wav	3.38	I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_245.wav	4.14	In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_246.wav	3.67	We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_247.wav	3.07	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_248.wav	1.84	It was a hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_249.wav	1.84	There's the mix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_250.wav	4.06	Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_251.wav	2.65	The concerns are the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_252.wav	3.25	He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_253.wav	3.67	For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_254.wav	3.72	It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_255.wav	3.20	It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_256.wav	3.80	One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_257.wav	3.46	Is that a serious question?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_258.wav	4.44	Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_259.wav	3.50	However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_260.wav	2.52	There's not much money in cycling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_261.wav	1.97	Souter will be back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_262.wav	3.76	In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_263.wav	3.25	Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_264.wav	3.03	He was also married with two children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_265.wav	2.26	The system can work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_266.wav	1.62	We are happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_267.wav	3.72	It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_268.wav	1.50	We're in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_269.wav	2.09	Of course I was tempted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_270.wav	3.72	The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_271.wav	2.18	It was very fast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_272.wav	3.29	He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_273.wav	2.18	They seem to get away with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_274.wav	1.84	I feel pretty good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_275.wav	3.03	The election is total confusion and chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_276.wav	1.71	She looked so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_277.wav	1.62	It's so awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_278.wav	1.80	He looked very sharp.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_279.wav	3.67	Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_280.wav	2.69	What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_281.wav	2.52	He will address the nation this evening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_282.wav	1.67	Yet, it worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_283.wav	1.67	Who will perform?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_284.wav	1.45	It was good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_285.wav	1.97	Who did the recruiting?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_286.wav	2.14	We are not going to forget.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_287.wav	2.18	No Briton has ever won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_288.wav	4.18	He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_289.wav	2.56	Who can predict?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_290.wav	1.92	There was a vacuum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_291.wav	3.55	I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_292.wav	2.35	He was at home with his pals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_293.wav	2.01	What has altered?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_294.wav	2.65	I was brought up in a mining background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_295.wav	1.71	She is really magic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_296.wav	3.72	Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_297.wav	2.31	One was a lawyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_298.wav	4.05	A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_299.wav	1.37	They are wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_300.wav	1.41	It could work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_301.wav	2.48	This is a war over our home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_302.wav	3.50	In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_303.wav	3.76	Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_304.wav	1.92	It needs a team approach.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_305.wav	4.19	The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_306.wav	1.71	There is no excuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_307.wav	3.63	However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_308.wav	2.26	The letters are going out today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_309.wav	2.18	She is very distinctive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_310.wav	2.01	We are a peaceful people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_311.wav	1.84	Hartley should know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_312.wav	2.18	Henman has been warned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_313.wav	4.18	Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_314.wav	3.63	Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_315.wav	2.05	A review is under way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_316.wav	1.50	It will work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_317.wav	2.61	I came into this world with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_318.wav	2.82	That is a trend which will be encouraged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_319.wav	1.54	Off with their heads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_320.wav	4.44	We think all other measures are not exhausted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_321.wav	2.52	There was no time scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_322.wav	2.44	Our message was inclusive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_323.wav	1.88	Either team will be hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_324.wav	2.05	It's not long enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_325.wav	2.74	Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_326.wav	1.79	He scored a touchdown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_327.wav	1.80	The party is up for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_328.wav	1.97	The outcome is not in doubt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_329.wav	3.16	Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_330.wav	3.25	In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_331.wav	3.50	The same things will happen with GM foods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_332.wav	3.42	Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_333.wav	2.27	Three years ago he would have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_334.wav	3.59	I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_335.wav	3.25	Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_336.wav	1.97	I've got no secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_337.wav	1.67	went on sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_338.wav	1.63	I'm very lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_339.wav	1.80	Our policy is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_340.wav	3.59	In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_341.wav	1.49	I will miss him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_342.wav	2.39	They should take their mobile phones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_343.wav	1.71	I got a yellow card.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_344.wav	3.21	From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_345.wav	3.16	The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_346.wav	1.84	I HAVE a dream.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_347.wav	2.01	There may be reasons for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_348.wav	3.33	Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_349.wav	4.19	Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_350.wav	4.74	A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_351.wav	3.93	The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_352.wav	2.13	The pair are very much in love.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_353.wav	2.65	It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_354.wav	3.76	To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_355.wav	1.71	We will be homeless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_356.wav	2.44	In fact, we were all over the shop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_357.wav	1.92	It is a memorial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_358.wav	3.20	It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_359.wav	3.20	He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_360.wav	2.01	This is a club on the rise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_361.wav	3.42	All the investment is possible through the public sector.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_362.wav	1.75	They believed it worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_363.wav	3.29	We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_364.wav	3.76	The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_365.wav	3.80	Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_366.wav	2.01	It seems a long time ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_367.wav	2.78	This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_368.wav	2.26	So there, we won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_369.wav	3.12	By that time, however, it was already too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_370.wav	2.14	There is no signature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_371.wav	4.23	Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_372.wav	2.90	It does not even have a staff shortage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_373.wav	3.59	However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_374.wav	2.73	I'm still an amateur in that sense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_375.wav	2.26	The Cabinet is split over the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_376.wav	1.50	Something is wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_377.wav	3.76	It will be an exciting finale to the season without a doubt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_378.wav	1.71	You can cope with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_379.wav	4.44	Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_380.wav	2.48	At the last I found a bunker.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_381.wav	2.22	It is the old story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_382.wav	2.09	Yet the data is compelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_383.wav	2.91	On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_384.wav	1.88	It's just outrageous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_385.wav	1.75	They deserved the win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_386.wav	3.20	The city council is a major property owner in the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_387.wav	3.42	The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_388.wav	2.48	Stewart will travel with some confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_389.wav	3.42	Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_390.wav	3.33	I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_391.wav	1.46	They are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_392.wav	3.55	He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_393.wav	1.84	But we are a young side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_394.wav	3.42	By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_395.wav	2.52	It will take place in July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_396.wav	2.35	What happened in the summer?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_397.wav	4.14	The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_398.wav	3.03	Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_399.wav	1.67	Is that possible?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_400.wav	2.65	But, in fact, the reverse is true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_401.wav	2.22	What was the difference between them?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_402.wav	3.72	The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p285\p285_403.wav	2.52	Emotions were complex.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_001.wav	2.99	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_002.wav	3.97	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_003.wav	7.04	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_004.wav	4.61	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_005.wav	6.79	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_006.wav	5.76	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_007.wav	4.78	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_008.wav	7.85	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_009.wav	5.00	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_010.wav	3.50	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_011.wav	7.51	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_012.wav	4.82	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_013.wav	4.61	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_014.wav	5.38	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_015.wav	6.02	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_016.wav	7.17	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_017.wav	4.18	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_018.wav	6.27	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_019.wav	8.07	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_020.wav	4.27	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_021.wav	9.60	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_022.wav	7.30	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_023.wav	12.33	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_024.wav	7.55	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_025.wav	3.29	Smoking is also very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_026.wav	2.78	We must convince the citizens.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_027.wav	2.86	I am pretty careful with money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_028.wav	2.56	Because we do not need it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_029.wav	2.18	It is about control of our economy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_030.wav	3.54	She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_031.wav	3.33	She is employed on short-term contracts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_032.wav	3.88	They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_033.wav	3.93	I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_034.wav	3.93	Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_035.wav	3.55	Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_036.wav	4.57	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_037.wav	3.16	Costs have got to be controlled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_038.wav	3.12	You must always attempt to raise the bar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_039.wav	3.25	The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_040.wav	2.82	It is serious - but not that serious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_041.wav	3.54	Among them are many criminals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_042.wav	2.60	He looks like an Afghan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_043.wav	2.26	He will need that machine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_044.wav	3.55	Her body was found about four miles from the car.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_045.wav	2.65	I had come back from London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_046.wav	2.95	Pulled a huge number of viewers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_047.wav	2.52	I had trouble with the producers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_048.wav	3.97	Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_049.wav	3.72	We are certainly talking about many millions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_050.wav	2.65	We are a new department.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_051.wav	2.78	He also presented You Bet!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_052.wav	3.63	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_053.wav	2.82	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_054.wav	2.39	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_055.wav	2.09	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_056.wav	2.61	People come to see the Highlands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_057.wav	3.93	The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_058.wav	2.73	We have not given up hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_059.wav	3.42	The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_060.wav	3.63	We would have concerns about suspension.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_061.wav	3.89	In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_062.wav	2.52	We have to keep our clients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_063.wav	2.31	It seems to have worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_064.wav	2.69	They have to come up with a solution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_065.wav	4.70	Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_066.wav	2.90	It is a great feeling right now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_067.wav	2.82	It's not covered by the insurance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_068.wav	2.77	Robin Williams is very subdued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_069.wav	2.52	It wasn't possible to relax.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_070.wav	2.56	We speak about the performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_071.wav	2.65	Then followed a bout of flu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_072.wav	2.90	Both sides have been hit by injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_073.wav	2.39	That would be too easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_074.wav	3.33	I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_075.wav	2.56	It is a job creation scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_076.wav	4.23	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_077.wav	2.52	Even the one she loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_078.wav	3.03	Talk of a crisis is absurd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_079.wav	3.08	Their mandate is to target inflation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_080.wav	3.76	England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_081.wav	2.74	It's all going to clear the debt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_082.wav	4.23	This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_083.wav	3.71	Petrol prices were widely blamed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_084.wav	2.61	He has been a success this year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_085.wav	2.65	The error appeared in a warrant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_086.wav	2.61	We have to offer value for money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_087.wav	3.12	Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_088.wav	2.26	It's so hard to shift.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_089.wav	2.52	Potions said he would drive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_090.wav	2.48	Theatre is not a museum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_091.wav	2.22	Why do it otherwise ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_092.wav	3.07	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_093.wav	2.35	So, did she meet him ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_094.wav	2.69	So what is the campaign about ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_095.wav	1.79	And does it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_096.wav	2.39	Are you from the rugby ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_097.wav	1.75	Had I heard ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_098.wav	3.16	Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_099.wav	3.46	Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_100.wav	5.08	The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_101.wav	2.78	It really was an unusual award.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_102.wav	2.35	I cannot believe this decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_103.wav	3.63	The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_104.wav	2.31	Until you hit the big games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_105.wav	3.50	The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_106.wav	2.61	We will deal with the refugees.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_107.wav	3.42	The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_108.wav	2.61	We could not get any possession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_109.wav	2.27	They must be on commission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_110.wav	3.76	He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_111.wav	3.29	It's not a holiday time for football players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_112.wav	2.52	He was forced to quit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_113.wav	2.35	But I know the course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_114.wav	3.72	Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_115.wav	3.54	We should recognise that others have done a good job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_116.wav	2.99	In the end we made too many errors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_117.wav	3.84	But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_118.wav	3.46	We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_119.wav	4.19	Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_120.wav	3.80	The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_121.wav	2.56	It is an impressive record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_122.wav	3.37	I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_123.wav	2.43	I have learned from him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_124.wav	3.76	I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_125.wav	3.50	The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_126.wav	2.52	Maybe this battle has been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_127.wav	3.33	In addition, investor choice is reduced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_128.wav	2.48	It isn't a happy memory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_129.wav	3.29	The firm also has a construction division.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_130.wav	2.82	Harry Potter has lost his magic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_131.wav	2.60	Then again, we could have.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_132.wav	3.16	They will remember this victory for a while.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_133.wav	3.25	Structural changes were also required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_134.wav	2.52	It was a good game to watch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_135.wav	2.57	His job was not advertised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_136.wav	3.25	However, the problem is the timing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_137.wav	3.12	They keep the atmosphere in mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_138.wav	2.95	Which can happen any time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_139.wav	3.29	It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_140.wav	3.16	The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_141.wav	2.99	My life has changed a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_142.wav	3.11	He said to give a local injection.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_143.wav	4.06	The manager's position was obviously included in that review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_144.wav	3.25	The first half was depressing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_145.wav	2.52	Tiger is not the norm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_146.wav	2.18	He will get his chances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_147.wav	2.05	They could use a boost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_148.wav	2.05	What happened in that game ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_149.wav	1.75	Are you going to win ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_150.wav	1.96	Was it the wife ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_151.wav	1.88	Why change it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_152.wav	2.61	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_153.wav	4.14	At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_154.wav	2.52	Anyone can do the sums.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_155.wav	3.46	The striker needed attention before he could resume.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_156.wav	2.14	He's not a Celtic man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_157.wav	3.16	It opens the door to the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_158.wav	4.78	No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_159.wav	2.56	There's only one team in Ayrshire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_160.wav	4.40	The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_161.wav	2.48	Behind him was his brother.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_162.wav	2.56	She had gone to the Catholic school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_163.wav	2.69	The family kept away from me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_164.wav	4.36	She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_165.wav	2.31	We will turn the corner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_166.wav	2.30	My Dad is a hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_167.wav	2.48	It should never have happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_168.wav	2.69	We did what we had to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_169.wav	2.22	The bank was now involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_170.wav	2.95	Full back was a bit of the unknown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_171.wav	2.60	It's never great to finish second.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_172.wav	2.65	Adventure is the champagne of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_173.wav	3.50	That would open the gates of hell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_174.wav	3.72	Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_175.wav	3.46	Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_176.wav	3.63	The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_177.wav	2.05	They could not match it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_178.wav	2.95	One season, they might do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_179.wav	3.25	The second aspect was the fear of failure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_180.wav	3.63	First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_181.wav	3.12	People should not become complacent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_182.wav	3.46	This championship is different from the other majors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_183.wav	3.29	I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_184.wav	2.65	I'm pretty happy with the way I played.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_185.wav	3.46	At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_186.wav	2.90	Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_187.wav	2.86	Each case is treated on merit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_188.wav	2.65	We have a long way to go this week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_189.wav	3.89	It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_190.wav	2.48	His son is a local legend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_191.wav	2.86	Our destiny is in our own hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_192.wav	3.46	They are only interested in attacking Labour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_193.wav	2.78	They need to look after themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_194.wav	3.12	Miller was every bit as happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_195.wav	3.25	It could be done by experts and lawyers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_196.wav	2.86	I cannot say too much about them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_197.wav	4.78	Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_198.wav	5.12	The new owners wanted the club to go in a different direction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_199.wav	3.89	It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_200.wav	3.20	I'm interested in interesting work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_201.wav	3.16	We represent a wide range of society.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_202.wav	2.39	It caused a lot of upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_203.wav	2.31	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_204.wav	2.27	how do you get it back ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_205.wav	2.35	What are you not good at ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_206.wav	2.65	I think, therefore I am ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_207.wav	1.96	Who was she ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_208.wav	3.03	Motorists will buy passes in advance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_209.wav	2.60	It's very difficult to find a buyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_210.wav	4.70	The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_211.wav	2.78	Mr Blair was ready for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_212.wav	2.61	Because he was born in England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_213.wav	2.95	We've had an enjoyable adventure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_214.wav	3.33	It comes from reflection or thinking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_215.wav	2.73	It was a moment of madness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_216.wav	2.39	This will be our new beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_217.wav	3.16	They have the cash and the fire power.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_218.wav	4.52	Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_219.wav	2.35	We should all be grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_220.wav	2.77	The early physical reports were clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_221.wav	2.73	The result is utterly compelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_222.wav	3.93	The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_223.wav	4.27	Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_224.wav	3.80	The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_225.wav	2.44	This will take several weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_226.wav	2.14	Scotland will play its part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_227.wav	3.54	The move follows a review of the Singapore
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_228.wav	4.23	Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_229.wav	3.46	This gives a financial incentive to switch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_230.wav	2.90	His injury was completely random.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_231.wav	3.37	And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_232.wav	2.48	It will affect their work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_233.wav	3.29	These things have not happened by accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_234.wav	3.42	They are difficult awards to decide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_235.wav	2.65	I am considered a teenager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_236.wav	2.52	He must get to know himself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_237.wav	3.93	There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_238.wav	3.21	It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_239.wav	2.73	Laura is an investment banker.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_240.wav	2.14	You could feel the heat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_241.wav	3.76	The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_242.wav	2.65	I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_243.wav	2.31	I have spoken to the skipper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_244.wav	4.44	The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_245.wav	2.73	The scientific debate is dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_246.wav	3.20	This would include the GM food industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_247.wav	3.24	A small number of new jobs will also be created.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_248.wav	2.73	They are the innocent victims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_249.wav	2.18	She will attend in July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_250.wav	3.12	He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_251.wav	2.82	She claimed the day was for young people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_252.wav	2.82	Pensions are a long-term investment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_253.wav	3.42	The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_254.wav	3.58	Customers would then be consulted over any changes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_255.wav	3.25	That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_256.wav	2.86	Three weeks later, he resigned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_257.wav	4.23	A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_258.wav	2.78	There were no reports of casualties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_259.wav	4.23	This fact is supported by audience research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_260.wav	3.76	Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_261.wav	2.99	And it was this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_262.wav	2.52	Kingfisher can afford to wait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_263.wav	4.95	Chairman Sir Alistair Grant will remain on the board as deputy chairman.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_264.wav	3.42	Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_265.wav	2.65	We have no information on Iraq.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_266.wav	2.31	His is a global perspective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_267.wav	3.67	Either way, the investor retains the premium.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_268.wav	3.67	Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_269.wav	3.76	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_270.wav	2.39	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_271.wav	3.37	No production contract is yet in sight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_272.wav	3.33	Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_273.wav	2.60	The capital costs are modest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_274.wav	3.25	Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_275.wav	3.12	This idea has been around for four years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_276.wav	2.31	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_277.wav	2.73	was everything done to save people ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_278.wav	2.48	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_279.wav	2.52	Do I think about them often ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_280.wav	2.39	Is it in the right place ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_281.wav	3.89	The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_282.wav	2.61	That will be a problem for later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_283.wav	3.29	Blair is very positive at European Councils.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_284.wav	2.65	They must play for each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_285.wav	2.43	These figures are truly terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_286.wav	3.07	Analysts had a mixed reaction to the numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_287.wav	2.77	There's not much money in cycling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_288.wav	2.69	The stage was set for a showdown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_289.wav	2.61	It wasn't about one player.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_290.wav	3.03	That view has not altered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_291.wav	4.18	Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_292.wav	4.27	Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_293.wav	3.63	Frankly, we should all have such problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_294.wav	3.03	It was an easy decision to come here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_295.wav	3.76	Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_296.wav	3.80	Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_297.wav	3.07	He's been here on numerous occasions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_298.wav	3.93	Further expansion has been achieved in Germany and Italy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_299.wav	5.47	That has been described in some quarters as nonsense and arrogance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_300.wav	2.86	You have to expect this type of thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_301.wav	4.31	However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_302.wav	4.06	It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_303.wav	2.95	Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_304.wav	3.42	The circumstances have changed since last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_305.wav	3.41	I intended to look for another club on loan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_306.wav	3.97	We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_307.wav	2.69	It was simply no contest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_308.wav	2.99	I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_309.wav	2.86	Motherwell have no such good fortune.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_310.wav	3.12	But it has been an amazing experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_311.wav	3.67	We would hope to make progress on that next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_312.wav	2.61	Our season is not finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_313.wav	2.82	The rescue package is public money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_314.wav	3.54	The effect was almost magical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_315.wav	2.01	I was there five months ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_316.wav	2.65	I am a retailer by nature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_317.wav	2.82	And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_318.wav	2.48	Holland won by five wickets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_319.wav	2.77	It's unlikely to be renewed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_320.wav	3.63	He has taken the title for the last two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_321.wav	2.61	The songs are just so good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_322.wav	2.65	I must do something about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_323.wav	2.69	We need to increase the membership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_324.wav	3.84	Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_325.wav	3.59	They can go to no other method of fishing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_326.wav	2.27	You are a different people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_327.wav	3.08	McNaughton was not so sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_328.wav	2.48	The dealer is on notice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_329.wav	4.65	A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_330.wav	2.65	It is a road of death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_331.wav	3.25	Investors can be forgiven for caution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_332.wav	2.43	The party lasted all night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_333.wav	3.76	Much the same thing happens in a young company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_334.wav	3.84	Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_335.wav	2.57	Six other people were injured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_336.wav	2.22	And he goes with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_337.wav	2.99	Survival is not an option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_338.wav	2.65	The letters are going out today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_339.wav	4.10	The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_340.wav	2.39	I didn't have the reply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_341.wav	2.61	The actor has met with Mandela.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_342.wav	3.84	It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_343.wav	2.86	My body is clearly capable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_344.wav	4.31	It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_345.wav	3.21	Other musicians were found in retirement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_346.wav	2.90	It is a terrible state of affairs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_347.wav	2.73	Do you think we are a top nation ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_348.wav	2.82	Is our children learning ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_349.wav	2.43	What form did that take ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_350.wav	2.35	Are they free ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_351.wav	2.14	Is there a waiting list ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_352.wav	2.69	They were impressive against France.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_353.wav	3.20	That is a trend which will be encouraged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_354.wav	3.88	It was a terrible combination of factors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_355.wav	4.61	Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_356.wav	3.50	Whether this return was too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_357.wav	4.65	Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_358.wav	2.18	The pain is still acute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_359.wav	4.31	Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_360.wav	2.35	I'd like to take the plunge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_361.wav	2.61	I have a moral dilemma.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_362.wav	3.08	My view has now completely changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_363.wav	2.86	We have very limited capacity.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_364.wav	4.87	In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_365.wav	4.87	It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_366.wav	3.67	He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_367.wav	2.31	I think we'll just keep it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_368.wav	2.99	The Allies intend to maintain the average.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_369.wav	2.65	Do not forget about Monaco.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_370.wav	2.05	You did not see it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_371.wav	2.82	But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_372.wav	2.56	I was delighted to accept.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_373.wav	2.48	Neither woman has been named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_374.wav	2.99	You need a licence to run a pub.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_375.wav	4.27	Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_376.wav	3.50	Yesterday was a statement of intent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_377.wav	3.33	They were to blame for the first two goals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_378.wav	3.46	Finally came the moment of truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_379.wav	3.33	Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_380.wav	2.99	It's as wide as a church in here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_381.wav	3.20	She is obviously very disappointed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_382.wav	2.86	It is not for any other purpose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_383.wav	3.63	Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_384.wav	2.22	The team hadn't been picked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_385.wav	3.93	No other job in world football can compare to this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_386.wav	3.50	One-third of the places are already taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_387.wav	3.08	The marshall at the turn was great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_388.wav	2.99	That time may never be broken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_389.wav	2.78	The director will be present.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_390.wav	3.07	Rugby has an extended run.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_391.wav	2.48	Is it worth it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_392.wav	2.39	Does it matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_393.wav	2.35	How do you take them away ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_394.wav	4.18	However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_395.wav	2.90	After the match, do you ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_396.wav	2.78	We have to put pressure on Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_397.wav	2.52	It gets into the culture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_398.wav	3.12	The ethos of the school was outstanding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_399.wav	2.52	In fact, he was great today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_400.wav	2.43	A review is under way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_401.wav	3.89	Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_402.wav	3.59	Offence to the herd was not easily overlooked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_403.wav	3.71	This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_404.wav	2.78	Well, the big day has arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_405.wav	3.08	Clark is back on top form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_406.wav	2.99	The choice is strictly personal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_407.wav	2.65	It's too close to call.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_408.wav	3.67	I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_409.wav	2.39	They were a lovely family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_410.wav	3.37	I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_411.wav	2.73	I've had a wonderful career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_412.wav	2.95	The Cabinet is split over the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_413.wav	4.40	Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_414.wav	2.39	It's just a training thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_415.wav	3.54	A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_416.wav	2.61	Three years ago he would have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_417.wav	3.76	George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_418.wav	3.75	But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_419.wav	2.82	It had been on the cards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_420.wav	4.23	Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_421.wav	3.50	This should put downward pressure on inflation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_422.wav	2.26	That was a touch of class.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_423.wav	3.59	On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_424.wav	2.73	It was important to win the singles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_425.wav	3.03	Being captain of this club is fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_426.wav	4.27	The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_427.wav	3.16	No date has been fixed for his return.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_428.wav	2.95	It was a breathtaking moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_429.wav	2.48	I never had a childhood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_430.wav	2.99	Nobody should believe this story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_431.wav	1.97	It's going to be epic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_432.wav	1.96	They did the right thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_433.wav	3.12	There is another important factor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_434.wav	2.91	The growth potential is enormous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_435.wav	3.33	THIS is a good day for Scottish farming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_436.wav	2.43	But he gave no details.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_437.wav	2.99	That was a great performance by the team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_438.wav	2.48	Which may be the same thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_439.wav	3.25	Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_440.wav	3.46	It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_441.wav	3.16	Everything in golf is a balance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_442.wav	3.67	It is never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_443.wav	4.02	Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_444.wav	3.33	It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_445.wav	2.78	There were no formal announcements.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_446.wav	2.86	He had no problems with discipline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_447.wav	4.65	Upgrading the station has been under consideration for some time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_448.wav	2.44	The couple had one daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_449.wav	5.85	National Farmer's Union of Scotland president Jim Walker welcomed the new proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_450.wav	3.20	We make this offer to the parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_451.wav	2.27	The jury is still out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_452.wav	3.84	No further details of expansion plans were given.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_453.wav	3.03	He was said to be emotionally disturbed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_454.wav	3.80	Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_455.wav	2.95	We're still the only ones in the High Street.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_456.wav	2.69	They were good years for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_457.wav	2.43	It was his job to check.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_458.wav	2.86	The boys are mentally focused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_459.wav	2.39	The damage has been done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_460.wav	4.23	The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_461.wav	2.43	They are defined by law.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_462.wav	2.86	The peace process will be buried!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_463.wav	2.48	We are now up against it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_464.wav	4.19	Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_465.wav	3.07	It is vital to clarify their role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_466.wav	2.61	He was backed by Downing Street.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_467.wav	4.23	It also indicated that her condition had deteriorated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p286\p286_468.wav	3.84	You have to have a proven track record to get them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_001.wav	2.56	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_002.wav	3.85	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_003.wav	7.85	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_004.wav	5.55	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_005.wav	7.04	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_006.wav	6.19	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_007.wav	4.95	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_008.wav	8.24	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_009.wav	5.81	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_010.wav	3.37	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_011.wav	7.17	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_012.wav	4.87	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_013.wav	4.57	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_014.wav	4.82	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_015.wav	6.23	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_016.wav	7.81	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_017.wav	4.01	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_018.wav	6.23	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_019.wav	7.43	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_020.wav	5.38	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_021.wav	9.31	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_022.wav	7.30	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_023.wav	11.74	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_024.wav	7.64	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_025.wav	4.48	A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_026.wav	3.12	In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_027.wav	3.29	Meetings will also remain private.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_028.wav	5.46	On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_029.wav	3.76	He has the courage of the unaware.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_030.wav	3.08	Life was like a timetable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_031.wav	2.60	This is a central issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_032.wav	2.52	But a solution has been found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_033.wav	2.48	I thought it was an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_034.wav	2.86	President Bush is at war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_035.wav	2.69	That period was a struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_036.wav	2.26	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_037.wav	4.27	But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_038.wav	3.72	Among them are many criminals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_039.wav	2.90	But it might have done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_040.wav	3.46	There is no reason at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_041.wav	3.16	This will get their attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_042.wav	3.16	Must be prepared to use it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_043.wav	2.69	He will need that machine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_044.wav	2.69	I had come back from London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_045.wav	2.35	I saw them last week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_046.wav	3.63	For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_047.wav	2.48	There was no safety net.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_048.wav	2.52	The teacher would have approved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_049.wav	2.90	It is quite a figure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_050.wav	2.95	We have to look beyond the very short term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_051.wav	2.78	It depends on the couple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_052.wav	3.07	I expect a rapid response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_053.wav	3.46	The motive for the shooting was not known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_054.wav	3.84	In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_055.wav	2.73	You do not change overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_056.wav	2.90	We will pay their bills.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_057.wav	2.78	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_058.wav	2.39	How are you, sir ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_059.wav	2.82	So is that it, then ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_060.wav	2.65	Do I have a favourite ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_061.wav	2.10	What do we do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_062.wav	2.65	It has been an amazing day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_063.wav	4.31	Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_064.wav	4.70	Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_065.wav	2.99	This is a big step up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_066.wav	3.46	There can be no compromise on welfare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_067.wav	3.93	Both sides have been hit by injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_068.wav	2.78	Now the plot is perfect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_069.wav	2.35	That would be too easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_070.wav	4.14	I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_071.wav	2.99	It looks like a hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_072.wav	3.59	After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_073.wav	2.99	I first met him last summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_074.wav	2.39	We did it for the jersey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_075.wav	3.76	Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_076.wav	3.29	By then, he was walking on water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_077.wav	4.01	Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_078.wav	3.55	The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_079.wav	2.48	That was a great performance by the team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_080.wav	2.65	It was a total disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_081.wav	2.82	I've never seen anything like it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_082.wav	3.80	He added that he felt undermined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_083.wav	2.60	It was not an insult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_084.wav	3.33	In each case they were a goal down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_085.wav	2.82	It was clear on Thursday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_086.wav	2.99	We would hope to make progress on that next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_087.wav	4.36	FOR once, you should believe the hype.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_088.wav	2.48	But I know the course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_089.wav	2.94	We intend to change the model.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_090.wav	2.90	Two of the team became ill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_091.wav	3.33	No, the equipment is extra.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_092.wav	3.29	This decision is a farce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_093.wav	3.33	Before the game we went for a pint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_094.wav	3.80	The cause of the fire is not yet known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_095.wav	4.66	It would be the end of farming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_096.wav	4.65	It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_097.wav	3.16	It's not a lack of confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_098.wav	2.99	We have got a race.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_099.wav	2.91	He will go on the bench.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_100.wav	2.35	You had better believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_101.wav	2.77	New Year will be very busy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_102.wav	2.95	There's still plenty time left.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_103.wav	2.91	That was the first step.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_104.wav	2.73	I was impressed with them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_105.wav	3.29	Such actions are rarely popular.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_106.wav	3.16	Mr Blair should be warned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_107.wav	2.65	Why do it otherwise ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_108.wav	3.50	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_109.wav	2.82	So, did she meet him ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_110.wav	3.33	So what is the campaign about ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_111.wav	2.73	And does it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_112.wav	2.05	Then again, we could have.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_113.wav	3.12	There were no grounds for his action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_114.wav	2.52	We have a training class.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_115.wav	3.76	Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_116.wav	3.25	We did what we had to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_117.wav	3.07	They made such decisions in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_118.wav	2.99	She was also very brave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_119.wav	4.10	But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_120.wav	2.82	You are a gambling man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_121.wav	3.07	My conscience is not clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_122.wav	3.08	He is a great addition to our team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_123.wav	2.77	I felt he was excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_124.wav	2.48	We will try to find someone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_125.wav	3.54	The money needs to go to the front line.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_126.wav	4.06	The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_127.wav	3.03	I miss the freedom that I had.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_128.wav	3.67	But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_129.wav	2.86	We had to add value.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_130.wav	4.18	Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_131.wav	4.48	Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_132.wav	2.43	That is the real test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_133.wav	2.86	I would relish the prospect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_134.wav	2.18	It has become a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_135.wav	3.50	We will provide immediate access.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_136.wav	3.50	It will clearly be discussed in cabinet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_137.wav	4.05	Three hours later, the man was free.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_138.wav	3.21	It was deployed in the Gulf War.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_139.wav	3.97	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_140.wav	5.55	Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_141.wav	3.71	She had gone to the Catholic school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_142.wav	2.52	It would seem a natural progression.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_143.wav	2.31	We will turn the corner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_144.wav	4.10	This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_145.wav	3.42	This action reflects a slump in bookings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_146.wav	3.42	The strong pound also took its toll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_147.wav	3.59	These days are long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_148.wav	2.44	I am a good player.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_149.wav	4.18	That shows the strength of the US Tour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_150.wav	2.60	We have a budget in March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_151.wav	3.25	The pension levels will remain the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_152.wav	3.07	You had to go and see him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_153.wav	2.52	They could not match it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_154.wav	3.03	The people are the hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_155.wav	4.65	Do not imagine for a moment that they are not there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_156.wav	4.91	The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_157.wav	3.93	First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_158.wav	2.60	This much I can tell you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_159.wav	3.03	The Hibs manager is no fool.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_160.wav	3.76	Phase one was a shambles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_161.wav	3.42	The hotel was now for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_162.wav	4.14	At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_163.wav	2.48	Tomorrow is a new day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_164.wav	2.86	What happened in that game ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_165.wav	2.18	Are you going to win ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_166.wav	2.39	Was it the wife ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_167.wav	2.05	Why change it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_168.wav	3.08	What do we want to do that for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_169.wav	2.73	His son is a local legend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_170.wav	2.73	I am not ready to walk away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_171.wav	2.39	Says the Duke of York.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_172.wav	4.01	Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_173.wav	3.80	Our destiny is in our own hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_174.wav	3.29	They bought the property four years ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_175.wav	2.99	They need to look after themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_176.wav	2.95	He is believed to live in Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_177.wav	3.16	People like to talk about these things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_178.wav	3.63	Being investor ready is a good start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_179.wav	4.44	They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_180.wav	3.16	We've had great things in the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_181.wav	3.33	It could be done by experts and lawyers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_182.wav	4.65	DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_183.wav	2.69	You know the sort of thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_184.wav	2.86	They were seriously after him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_185.wav	3.97	However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_186.wav	2.69	It was a pre-emptive strike.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_187.wav	2.48	It caused a lot of upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_188.wav	4.40	This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_189.wav	2.78	Last night was a key episode.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_190.wav	3.93	We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_191.wav	2.26	It is hard to tell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_192.wav	2.65	I can't play the game for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_193.wav	3.50	I was inspired by two things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_194.wav	3.20	They might be surprised by the response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_195.wav	3.41	It comes from reflection or thinking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_196.wav	3.67	This will be our new beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_197.wav	3.93	The service from the other players was super.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_198.wav	4.95	However, it is not as simple as this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_199.wav	3.97	The sanctions are about collective punishment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_200.wav	5.17	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_201.wav	3.03	Getting this right is essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_202.wav	2.44	Does the name matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_203.wav	2.56	how do you get it back ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_204.wav	2.39	What are you not good at ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_205.wav	2.69	I think, therefore I am ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_206.wav	2.14	Who was she ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_207.wav	3.93	We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_208.wav	4.10	From there, they can go anywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_209.wav	2.52	I had relied on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_210.wav	3.67	We used to live with dignity in our country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_211.wav	3.12	This is a sensible and common sense approach.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_212.wav	2.52	It had all been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_213.wav	3.33	His third goal was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_214.wav	3.50	It's all change at Kilmarnock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_215.wav	3.12	His second was a beauty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_216.wav	3.46	I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_217.wav	3.38	I wouldn't even respond to that question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_218.wav	3.71	And the World Cup has not even begun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_219.wav	4.05	He remains a main board director of Royal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_220.wav	3.29	The red card was okay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_221.wav	3.84	It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_222.wav	3.93	Women were mostly notable by their absence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_223.wav	4.06	It will now take over the running of the estate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_224.wav	4.01	The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_225.wav	3.67	I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_226.wav	4.78	Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_227.wav	3.97	So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_228.wav	3.33	We have learned a tremendous amount.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_229.wav	2.86	She died in middle age.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_230.wav	3.50	And thought we would get away with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_231.wav	3.07	We were a load of rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_232.wav	4.27	The trust was unable to pay the fourth interim dividend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_233.wav	3.03	This is a family club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_234.wav	2.35	They need to win a trophy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_235.wav	2.48	I was ready for this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_236.wav	3.16	I am still waiting for a reply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_237.wav	3.55	Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_238.wav	3.42	My future is in the marathon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_239.wav	3.54	The effects are not all bad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_240.wav	2.99	He would not impose a fine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_241.wav	2.99	It was a fairy tale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_242.wav	4.06	He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_243.wav	2.69	She took them for a term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_244.wav	3.29	In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_245.wav	3.41	But that's another story for another day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_246.wav	3.63	On a practical level, it would be difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_247.wav	3.12	Persuaded to change his mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_248.wav	4.10	Either way, the investor retains the premium.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_249.wav	4.87	By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_250.wav	4.31	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_251.wav	2.65	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_252.wav	3.03	It makes no difference to their friendship.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_253.wav	3.20	No production contract is yet in sight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_254.wav	3.84	Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_255.wav	2.60	That you can do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_256.wav	2.18	He was on a horse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_257.wav	2.61	The concerns are the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_258.wav	2.18	We are in a war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_259.wav	4.05	It is not enough to be first division champions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_260.wav	2.44	We run within the law.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_261.wav	3.20	On the contrary they stand to gain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_262.wav	3.08	They are very keen to work with us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_263.wav	3.63	That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_264.wav	3.84	It does not work that way in Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_265.wav	3.33	They must play for each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_266.wav	2.94	It is also very valuable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_267.wav	3.08	There's not much money in cycling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_268.wav	4.48	It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_269.wav	4.57	The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_270.wav	3.20	We're trying to get rounded performers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_271.wav	2.95	This is a question of Islam.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_272.wav	3.25	And they were being paid ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_273.wav	2.86	was everything done to save people ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_274.wav	3.67	What was the matter for concern ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_275.wav	2.90	Do I think about them often ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_276.wav	2.90	Is it in the right place ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_277.wav	2.09	Did he trip ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_278.wav	3.97	As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_279.wav	4.52	Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_280.wav	3.80	Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_281.wav	4.78	It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_282.wav	3.58	Frankly, we should all have such problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_283.wav	3.07	It was an easy decision to come here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_284.wav	3.24	And Michael was just great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_285.wav	4.31	Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_286.wav	4.23	He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_287.wav	3.03	He was dead on arrival at hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_288.wav	2.82	It was never a free kick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_289.wav	2.65	She failed in her action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_290.wav	3.46	He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_291.wav	3.97	We have to be very, very careful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_292.wav	4.40	In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_293.wav	3.76	The partnership was set up during the summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_294.wav	2.82	If not, he should go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_295.wav	4.06	There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_296.wav	2.99	Size is not the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_297.wav	4.57	The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_298.wav	3.29	But it is up again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_299.wav	4.14	The rescue package is public money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_300.wav	2.44	Either team will be hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_301.wav	2.90	That is the general feeling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_302.wav	2.69	It has to be an event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_303.wav	3.20	Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_304.wav	2.69	We can work all night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_305.wav	3.37	The answer is with ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_306.wav	4.82	Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott appealed for privacy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_307.wav	2.86	There is no evidence for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_308.wav	2.69	I can hardly believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_309.wav	2.39	Nothing has been put into action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_310.wav	2.35	You are a different people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_311.wav	2.86	Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_312.wav	3.59	This will secure the future of our industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_313.wav	2.90	They are not left wing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_314.wav	3.67	McNaughton was not so sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_315.wav	3.72	I was brought up in a mining background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_316.wav	3.12	The City welcomed the numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_317.wav	4.05	Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_318.wav	3.50	This is a war over our home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_319.wav	3.24	We have a good healthy debate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_320.wav	2.18	And he goes with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_321.wav	2.18	I have signed a contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_322.wav	2.43	It is a court case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_323.wav	4.57	However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_324.wav	4.99	Leading share prices have also fallen in Paris and Frankfurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_325.wav	5.13	However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_326.wav	3.03	After some discussion they did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_327.wav	3.97	The Premier League has been a huge success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_328.wav	2.44	It wasn't a good day for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_329.wav	2.73	The show is at an end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_330.wav	2.39	What form did that take ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_331.wav	1.75	Are they free ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_332.wav	2.14	What are they for ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_333.wav	2.61	Is there a waiting list ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_334.wav	3.46	Do they think anyone else wants them ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_335.wav	2.61	So what happens next ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_336.wav	2.60	It was an achievement all right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_337.wav	2.56	My whole life has changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_338.wav	2.56	We are a peaceful people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_339.wav	4.31	The election is total confusion and chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_340.wav	2.74	You may have a short memory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_341.wav	3.12	The problems began a long time ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_342.wav	2.82	A Home Office spokesman said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_343.wav	3.16	In the old days, it was easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_344.wav	2.65	I think it's about time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_345.wav	2.99	The airport was even different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_346.wav	2.65	Other people had looked at it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_347.wav	2.73	They are now out in the cold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_348.wav	4.48	It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_349.wav	2.69	It is a strong case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_350.wav	3.21	My view has now completely changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_351.wav	3.63	Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_352.wav	4.78	Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_353.wav	2.90	It's wonderful to have won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_354.wav	3.08	He was then replaced by Ross.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_355.wav	3.29	I'd like to take the plunge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_356.wav	3.24	Appointments should be made on merit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_357.wav	2.74	I have a moral dilemma.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_358.wav	2.82	Even the one she loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_359.wav	4.18	This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_360.wav	4.48	A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_361.wav	4.23	They were the acts of men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_362.wav	4.23	This should include procedures for personal imports.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_363.wav	3.46	The idea was first mooted a year ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_364.wav	3.50	Three years ago he would have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_365.wav	2.31	He did a good job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_366.wav	3.20	It's a policy which has worked for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_367.wav	2.60	Look at the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_368.wav	3.84	He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_369.wav	3.25	It is a stroke of genius.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_370.wav	2.99	The members have voted against it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_371.wav	3.12	We knew he was very creative.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_372.wav	3.03	But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_373.wav	3.76	George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_374.wav	2.99	They should take their mobile phones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_375.wav	3.33	SE is well down that road.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_376.wav	4.53	The hill farm is owned by the father of the young man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_377.wav	3.33	There is a cup final at stake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_378.wav	2.57	It's only a matter of scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_379.wav	2.91	I do not like to lose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_380.wav	2.82	There is no deal as yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_381.wav	3.29	It's as wide as a church in here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_382.wav	3.16	This remains the party's policy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_383.wav	2.78	They will fight for everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_384.wav	3.29	The pair are very much in love.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_385.wav	4.10	Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_386.wav	2.43	It was like a vacuum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_387.wav	5.12	Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_388.wav	2.65	My dad is all right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_389.wav	3.07	It gets into the culture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_390.wav	2.65	There was a substantial explosion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_391.wav	2.69	But we are very near.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_392.wav	3.07	Finally, he paid for the movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_393.wav	3.59	It has only been rumours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_394.wav	3.76	He put some colour into Scottish history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_395.wav	4.14	This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_396.wav	3.24	It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_397.wav	2.48	Safety was also an issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_398.wav	3.46	Had this been common practice ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_399.wav	2.52	What do they want us to do ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_400.wav	2.14	Is it worth it ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_401.wav	1.88	Does it matter ?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_402.wav	4.61	Motion described it as a unique event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_403.wav	3.63	We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_404.wav	3.37	No, because it was too many.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_405.wav	2.69	It's too close to call.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_406.wav	4.10	I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_407.wav	2.69	I decided to take my time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_408.wav	3.84	FIRST, we had the Battle of Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_409.wav	3.93	Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_410.wav	3.41	That is the ultimate revenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_411.wav	2.73	It certainly appeared that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_412.wav	2.44	They are looking for profit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_413.wav	2.78	I remain a buyer of the shares.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_414.wav	3.33	YOU thought it was a headache.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_415.wav	3.97	I am astonished at attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_416.wav	4.23	This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_417.wav	3.37	There is a solution, she believes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_418.wav	4.48	Potions said he would drive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_419.wav	3.42	It was important to win the singles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_420.wav	3.12	I'm pleased about one thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_421.wav	3.50	That's been all around Europe with me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_422.wav	3.76	He's had to suffer for the last six years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_423.wav	4.70	In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p287\p287_424.wav	2.99	Both promotions come as no surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_001.wav	2.65	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_002.wav	3.63	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_003.wav	7.21	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_004.wav	5.51	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_005.wav	7.04	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_006.wav	6.02	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_007.wav	5.04	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_008.wav	8.45	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_009.wav	5.38	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_010.wav	3.07	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_011.wav	6.70	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_012.wav	4.74	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_013.wav	4.82	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_014.wav	4.91	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_015.wav	5.93	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_016.wav	7.04	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_017.wav	3.72	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_018.wav	5.93	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_019.wav	8.15	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_020.wav	4.01	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_021.wav	8.88	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_022.wav	7.34	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_023.wav	11.48	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_024.wav	7.38	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_025.wav	4.74	She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_026.wav	2.95	It is a disaster area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_027.wav	2.44	Is this accurate?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_028.wav	3.84	However, the following year the cancer returned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_029.wav	2.65	Because we do not need it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_030.wav	2.35	I was an athlete.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_031.wav	3.16	It is a case of taking a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_032.wav	4.36	We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_033.wav	3.76	I think a move would create a lot of interest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_034.wav	2.73	It was fit for royalty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_035.wav	3.89	Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_036.wav	2.78	President Bush is at war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_037.wav	4.31	That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_038.wav	1.92	I was scared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_039.wav	4.48	It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_040.wav	2.90	But it took a lot of bottle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_041.wav	3.03	Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_042.wav	1.97	We need to chat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_043.wav	2.56	But it might have done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_044.wav	3.50	Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_045.wav	2.78	He is too weak to move.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_046.wav	4.31	Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_047.wav	3.80	He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_048.wav	2.05	It will come all right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_049.wav	1.79	I was lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_050.wav	2.31	I guess I was lucky, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_051.wav	2.82	I was inspired by two things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_052.wav	2.52	Sadly, it can't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_053.wav	1.75	It's very odd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_054.wav	1.71	It is unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_055.wav	1.96	It will take time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_056.wav	2.05	That's the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_057.wav	4.14	The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_058.wav	3.50	The problems are a result of that shortfall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_059.wav	2.95	Four other charges were dropped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_060.wav	4.27	Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_061.wav	2.44	They're appalled by that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_062.wav	2.95	Scotland had great assets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_063.wav	3.38	Equity declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_064.wav	3.37	We should have known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_065.wav	5.29	The end result is precisely the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_066.wav	3.03	Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_067.wav	4.14	There is an element of racism in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_068.wav	2.95	That was the easy election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_069.wav	4.70	IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_070.wav	2.69	Neither it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_071.wav	2.91	He seemed to lose his focus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_072.wav	2.39	It can be halted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_073.wav	2.57	It was chaotic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_074.wav	3.03	Is there a new way forward?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_075.wav	4.74	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_076.wav	2.26	I've not thought about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_077.wav	3.08	People must remain vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_078.wav	3.12	This is the way things should be handled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_079.wav	4.48	Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_080.wav	3.76	It's all going to clear the debt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_081.wav	3.63	Last week, he was taken into hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_082.wav	3.46	Nothing is yet confirmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_083.wav	4.18	New Zealand rugby is totally different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_084.wav	2.91	We have other options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_085.wav	4.27	When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_086.wav	3.07	By then, he was walking on water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_087.wav	4.44	It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_088.wav	3.97	Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_089.wav	3.76	Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_090.wav	2.05	It is a lifeline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_091.wav	4.22	That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_092.wav	4.19	Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_093.wav	3.97	They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_094.wav	4.44	Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_095.wav	2.65	Journalists should make him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_096.wav	2.60	It was a good performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_097.wav	3.93	Here, again, they were denied a voice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_098.wav	2.90	I didn't play well last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_099.wav	2.39	It was an adventure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_100.wav	3.42	I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_101.wav	2.01	I'm not depressed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_102.wav	4.27	He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_103.wav	1.97	It's in his blood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_104.wav	3.07	It had been played at festivals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_105.wav	3.29	We do not expect any surplus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_106.wav	2.14	It is so sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_107.wav	2.44	They were behind the wheel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_108.wav	2.60	The fire was above the hole.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_109.wav	4.70	We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_110.wav	3.72	On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_111.wav	4.14	It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_112.wav	4.31	Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_113.wav	1.75	It is rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_114.wav	4.44	This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_115.wav	4.78	An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_116.wav	2.05	That's all right then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_117.wav	2.95	There were no grounds for his action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_118.wav	4.91	It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_119.wav	4.40	It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_120.wav	1.92	I'm so angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_121.wav	2.99	It has removed a bit of guilt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_122.wav	3.80	So the European elections are extremely important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_123.wav	5.17	The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_124.wav	2.56	Well, you can have a tree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_125.wav	2.26	I had relied on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_126.wav	2.99	You've got to be vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_127.wav	2.86	The goals were good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_128.wav	3.97	We never said that we would walk through the third division.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_129.wav	5.04	We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_130.wav	5.42	If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_131.wav	5.17	And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_132.wav	5.04	We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_133.wav	2.39	Is that Titanic?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_134.wav	4.65	He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_135.wav	5.17	Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_136.wav	5.46	Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_137.wav	4.61	It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_138.wav	1.75	He should have won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_139.wav	3.50	The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_140.wav	4.27	The selection process is still at a very early stage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_141.wav	2.99	The weather forecast isn't good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_142.wav	5.08	A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_143.wav	4.78	Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_144.wav	4.61	That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_145.wav	4.40	She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_146.wav	4.10	Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_147.wav	3.42	They were later discharged from hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_148.wav	3.72	This latter point is hugely important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_149.wav	3.46	Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_150.wav	3.24	It was so new, so exciting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_151.wav	2.73	I'm just enjoying every match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_152.wav	4.74	Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_153.wav	2.26	It has to be now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_154.wav	3.29	I was in the train station overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_155.wav	5.21	Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_156.wav	3.20	We knew we had the goal we wanted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_157.wav	2.43	I have got a wife to feed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_158.wav	2.95	It is not too late to get on board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_159.wav	2.31	They will do their own thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_160.wav	2.61	Does that put pressure on us?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_161.wav	3.97	Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_162.wav	2.52	It is too much for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_163.wav	2.43	It is a terrible place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_164.wav	3.59	And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_165.wav	2.60	Nobody did in those days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_166.wav	4.70	It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_167.wav	2.39	He was a crazy man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_168.wav	2.95	They thought they had found a home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_169.wav	2.52	The jury is still out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_170.wav	2.56	It's quite a routine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_171.wav	2.26	It should be easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_172.wav	5.46	In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_173.wav	2.22	Tony had arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_174.wav	4.35	Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_175.wav	3.55	There is no point in looking any further.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_176.wav	4.69	Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_177.wav	3.93	It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_178.wav	4.35	Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_179.wav	2.01	It's a joke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_180.wav	3.38	It just came into my head that day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_181.wav	3.42	They really did a great job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_182.wav	3.76	It is tough, but possible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_183.wav	4.31	It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_184.wav	2.82	People will ask about us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_185.wav	3.21	If the director is with you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_186.wav	3.16	It's very difficult to find a buyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_187.wav	4.48	We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_188.wav	4.18	The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_189.wav	2.09	Peace was won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_190.wav	4.61	It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_191.wav	2.78	I wanted to put myself on the line.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_192.wav	4.70	It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_193.wav	4.48	It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_194.wav	2.95	The conference is the first test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_195.wav	2.05	Is that success?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_196.wav	3.25	But we are not immune to the problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_197.wav	2.52	They are in the euro.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_198.wav	4.31	I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_199.wav	2.05	But she might be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_200.wav	3.42	It's all about money, money, money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_201.wav	4.82	Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_202.wav	4.14	After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_203.wav	2.95	Now, it's all right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_204.wav	3.63	This gives a financial incentive to switch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_205.wav	2.95	Saddam Hussein is a devil.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_206.wav	1.80	Feel the heat?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_207.wav	2.39	She should not be blamed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_208.wav	3.20	Twaddle is a case in point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_209.wav	3.63	It had all been arranged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_210.wav	3.33	The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_211.wav	3.46	In each case they were a goal down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_212.wav	2.14	I was so nervous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_213.wav	3.63	However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_214.wav	4.35	The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_215.wav	4.06	He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_216.wav	1.97	Who was on the panel?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_217.wav	3.07	A career as a doctor is on hold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_218.wav	2.35	We've got the bronze.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_219.wav	2.86	Mental health is a massive issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_220.wav	2.78	You have to do your research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_221.wav	2.26	We played them off the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_222.wav	3.80	But it will be sorted out this week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_223.wav	2.31	It was good fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_224.wav	3.89	It's a question of creating a future awareness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_225.wav	2.90	I'd never seen a play about me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_226.wav	4.31	It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_227.wav	3.08	The track is currently covered in snow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_228.wav	2.48	The body follows the mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_229.wav	3.67	However, no further action was taken by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_230.wav	2.73	She hopes to study in Britain one day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_231.wav	2.61	It is set in Paris.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_232.wav	3.67	Half of young people had had contact with the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_233.wav	3.37	I haven't made the donation yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_234.wav	2.82	And a film maker was born.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_235.wav	4.65	On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_236.wav	3.42	Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_237.wav	4.14	We have a free vote on these things in our party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_238.wav	2.01	He's got to go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_239.wav	4.02	He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_240.wav	1.93	It's too much work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_241.wav	3.63	It would appear that it has not been a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_242.wav	4.48	A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_243.wav	2.18	It is hard won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_244.wav	3.71	Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_245.wav	2.94	In fact, we were all over the shop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_246.wav	2.13	He's a lovely young man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_247.wav	2.78	A friendship that will endure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_248.wav	3.58	He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_249.wav	4.40	I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_250.wav	3.63	Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_251.wav	2.52	I told you I was ill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_252.wav	2.99	It's a source of deep concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_253.wav	2.05	This is a big club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_254.wav	3.88	It is very important that we get the balance right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_255.wav	4.44	One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_256.wav	2.56	I was happily surprised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_257.wav	4.44	The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_258.wav	4.31	Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_259.wav	4.57	George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_260.wav	2.35	Blood samples were taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_261.wav	3.20	We shall rely on human beings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_262.wav	2.78	This is a question of Islam.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_263.wav	2.82	It looks as though he will be right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_264.wav	4.27	The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_265.wav	5.25	He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_266.wav	4.23	Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_267.wav	4.87	We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_268.wav	2.90	And Michael was just great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_269.wav	4.10	It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_270.wav	2.65	In fact, they have the opposite effect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_271.wav	3.54	Our objective is to tackle poverty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_272.wav	3.80	A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_273.wav	2.86	He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_274.wav	2.52	I am an estate agent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_275.wav	3.80	In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_276.wav	3.16	It happens from time to time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_277.wav	2.31	But I've won both ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_278.wav	4.23	This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_279.wav	2.60	You've got to have both sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_280.wav	3.20	He will address the nation this evening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_281.wav	3.16	The attacker died in the crash.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_282.wav	3.89	Maloney is an engaging talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_283.wav	2.18	Who will perform?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_284.wav	3.63	It's like a high school play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_285.wav	4.74	The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_286.wav	3.12	This is a national crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_287.wav	3.33	The death toll included five children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_288.wav	2.44	Who did the recruiting?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_289.wav	1.97	So I did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_290.wav	5.55	The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_291.wav	3.12	Sunday's game was not a trial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_292.wav	2.01	Who can predict?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_293.wav	4.40	I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_294.wav	4.61	The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_295.wav	2.99	We have to sort it out ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_296.wav	4.65	That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_297.wav	3.29	The home was now under new management.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_298.wav	2.95	I thought it was my only chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_299.wav	3.16	However, the snow was welcomed by some.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_300.wav	2.22	Nothing is safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_301.wav	2.35	One was a lawyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_302.wav	4.74	The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_303.wav	4.10	We believe the world has too many refugees already.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_304.wav	5.04	Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_305.wav	4.19	In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_306.wav	2.86	It's just not funny!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_307.wav	3.93	I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_308.wav	3.46	SCOTLAND has shown the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_309.wav	2.18	It's certainly different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_310.wav	4.14	O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_311.wav	3.41	We want to play at the worlds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_312.wav	2.35	He was solid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_313.wav	3.29	This is the culture change in medicine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_314.wav	4.74	and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_315.wav	3.97	There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_316.wav	2.94	I never thought it would take this long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_317.wav	2.43	My whole life has changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_318.wav	2.52	They wanted the club to make money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_319.wav	1.96	Hartley should know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_320.wav	1.88	Kids are terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_321.wav	3.42	The home team had an amazing start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_322.wav	2.61	My body is clearly capable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_323.wav	3.50	For the moment, our position remains the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_324.wav	2.18	I had my suspicions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_325.wav	3.08	However, the groups denied the claims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_326.wav	2.95	There was some merit in that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_327.wav	2.69	I came into this world with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_328.wav	3.33	In his absence, the council adopted the change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_329.wav	3.55	The figures are bad, but not that bad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_330.wav	4.05	They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_331.wav	2.22	We agreed to disagree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_332.wav	2.78	He was then replaced by Ross.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_333.wav	2.48	Donald was his friend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_334.wav	2.91	I'd like to take the plunge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_335.wav	3.20	She did not attend the courtroom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_336.wav	2.69	Finally, he paid for the movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_337.wav	3.80	You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_338.wav	3.42	The same things will happen with GM foods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_339.wav	3.25	In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_340.wav	4.19	I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_341.wav	4.06	I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_342.wav	3.42	These days are long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_343.wav	3.33	He's been the key to everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_344.wav	2.82	The boat was fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_345.wav	5.34	A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_346.wav	4.40	I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_347.wav	3.93	It was good for us that they lost that day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_348.wav	4.44	A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_349.wav	3.03	You need a licence to run a pub.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_350.wav	2.61	That has been lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_351.wav	4.65	A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_352.wav	4.53	That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_353.wav	3.38	It's good to start with Judith.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_354.wav	3.03	There is no room for error.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_355.wav	3.12	The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_356.wav	5.25	In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_357.wav	2.30	He's very explosive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_358.wav	2.39	We have to move forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_359.wav	4.61	But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_360.wav	3.12	However, it was well worth the wait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_361.wav	1.84	Our numbers are small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_362.wav	1.66	That would help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_363.wav	1.75	So I left.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_364.wav	4.36	Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_365.wav	4.99	It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_366.wav	3.16	It was a double tragedy for the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_367.wav	1.71	I am a star.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_368.wav	2.35	Not so, it seems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_369.wav	2.18	Who was the mystery MP?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_370.wav	3.80	All the investment is possible through the public sector.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_371.wav	3.50	The play is based on a real-life event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_372.wav	3.08	Now, though, he has an incentive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_373.wav	4.70	Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_374.wav	3.97	It also highlighted some local hero districts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_375.wav	3.33	We do not get that impression now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_376.wav	3.54	They play together perfectly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_377.wav	2.27	It was a funny game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_378.wav	2.43	It is a large number.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_379.wav	2.90	I am a wealthy person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_380.wav	3.76	Colour was at the core of his life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_381.wav	3.71	I know I'm in a very special position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_382.wav	3.42	Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_383.wav	4.44	It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_384.wav	3.97	It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_385.wav	4.44	He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_386.wav	2.95	There is a solution, she believes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_387.wav	3.42	One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_388.wav	3.76	On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_389.wav	2.26	It's just outrageous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_390.wav	1.97	It's like a basketball.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_391.wav	3.33	Stewart will travel with some confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_392.wav	2.31	He is on the wrong side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_393.wav	3.03	It is not normal practice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_394.wav	3.97	This is a major step forward for carers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_395.wav	4.70	The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_396.wav	2.69	My house was shaking at the time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_397.wav	2.22	Emotions were complex.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_398.wav	3.08	His remarks appear to have had an effect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_399.wav	2.35	He's already made history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_400.wav	2.48	Then , he laughs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_401.wav	2.65	You ask the question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_402.wav	5.25	That is not in the interests of anyone or any party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_403.wav	3.89	What would be the point?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_404.wav	4.48	I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_405.wav	4.70	Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_406.wav	4.14	I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_407.wav	3.59	The real enemy is in your own back yard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_408.wav	4.18	The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_409.wav	3.71	We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_410.wav	3.84	Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_411.wav	4.36	The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p288\p288_412.wav	2.01	That may be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_001.wav	2.01	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_013.wav	4.91	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_014.wav	5.45	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_015.wav	6.49	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_016.wav	7.73	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_017.wav	3.29	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_020.wav	3.76	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_021.wav	9.26	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_022.wav	6.96	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_023.wav	11.48	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_024.wav	7.13	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_025.wav	3.08	I was not involved in these discussions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_026.wav	2.60	O, Is he conscious?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_027.wav	3.80	Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_028.wav	3.50	They are being deported from their homes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_029.wav	3.59	IT IS the last week of rehearsals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_030.wav	3.24	I thought the game was very poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_031.wav	3.12	Three days later, he was killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_032.wav	2.90	I don't expect to be here tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_033.wav	3.67	Or it's not really for us, if you like.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_034.wav	2.30	It was a deceit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_035.wav	2.26	You are in power.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_036.wav	2.82	PR will be just one of them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_037.wav	4.95	Everything is obviously in the very early stages.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_038.wav	3.07	It is just like the stock market.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_039.wav	2.91	And the newspapers were full of it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_040.wav	3.07	I wish the solutions were as easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_041.wav	3.50	She does not see anything ever changing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_042.wav	2.95	It doesn't come any better than this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_043.wav	2.69	Mr Blair should be warned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_044.wav	3.12	The idea has potential for the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_045.wav	3.37	I did not concentrate on my performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_046.wav	2.78	That was not due to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_047.wav	3.37	Structural changes were also required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_048.wav	2.90	We suffered a lot for seven years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_049.wav	2.73	The racist abuse was terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_050.wav	2.52	What is the new religion?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_051.wav	3.08	Five officers were injured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_052.wav	3.33	It was all for good reason as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_053.wav	3.50	Fewer people are being killed in accidents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_054.wav	3.46	I'm trying not to think about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_055.wav	3.08	Ms Jackson was not at the meeting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_056.wav	2.86	I find the whole affair disturbing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_057.wav	3.07	One woman refused to sit down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_058.wav	3.42	We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_059.wav	2.48	I was completely knackered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_060.wav	3.33	There are two interests in this woodland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_061.wav	2.77	A killer is also on the loose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_062.wav	3.12	Last night, the row continued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_063.wav	2.82	Our approach will be different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_064.wav	3.08	You can see how he made his money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_065.wav	3.20	It's really good, as long as we play well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_066.wav	3.33	We would certainly consider the proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_067.wav	2.86	We tend to come good at the end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_068.wav	3.08	His record with England was not good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_069.wav	3.46	Lose, and they would be ridiculed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_070.wav	2.73	Three penalties were given.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_071.wav	3.37	I didn't think they would be that stupid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_072.wav	3.25	He was between people and God.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_073.wav	2.78	We are just being flooded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_074.wav	3.29	We could easily have lost that game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_075.wav	4.06	If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_076.wav	3.24	There were no proposals on the table.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_077.wav	4.06	It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_078.wav	3.54	THERE's only one word for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_079.wav	3.07	It was very full anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_080.wav	2.78	That was him under pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_081.wav	2.99	I can't believe she is dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_082.wav	2.65	I was in prison for a year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_083.wav	3.29	Among them is his beloved teacher.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_084.wav	3.25	He had a really frustrating time last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_085.wav	3.29	I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_086.wav	3.16	I am constantly changing my mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_087.wav	3.03	It was deployed in the Gulf War.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_088.wav	4.01	Ending a tenancy is a last resort.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_089.wav	2.61	But he just carried on anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_090.wav	3.41	We should be capable of managing it, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_091.wav	2.78	It was that kind of afternoon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_092.wav	3.42	His presence was very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_093.wav	4.06	We are pursuing legal action against the government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_094.wav	3.59	He insisted that his staff were too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_095.wav	3.24	They should come clean.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_096.wav	3.72	Let's see that increase over the years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_097.wav	3.03	That, though, is an old story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_098.wav	2.90	The real issue is personal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_099.wav	2.61	Life becomes a song.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_100.wav	3.63	It's about time something was done about equipment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_101.wav	3.20	I've learned from my mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_102.wav	3.20	So far this season this approach is working.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_103.wav	2.65	I have got a knife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_104.wav	3.63	It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_105.wav	2.13	What did we learn?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_106.wav	3.33	On that basis, he would set it aside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_107.wav	3.37	That, however, is the end of the good news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_108.wav	3.29	Seven people were later detained by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_109.wav	2.52	It's nice to be involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_110.wav	3.93	There could still be some to come forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_111.wav	1.88	What are they like?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_112.wav	3.63	They were back in favour with the SAC.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_113.wav	2.35	The squad is too small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_114.wav	3.97	Together they will attempt to express the whole.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_115.wav	2.82	I'm just going to do my best.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_116.wav	3.67	At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_117.wav	3.16	They offered to make an investment into it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_118.wav	3.03	We have no knowledge of this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_119.wav	3.38	I was influenced by all of these things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_120.wav	2.95	Is my wife a racist?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_121.wav	3.50	This would not be my first choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_122.wav	4.05	It certainly should not be used too often.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_123.wav	2.61	They will run a mile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_124.wav	3.08	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_125.wav	3.20	Britain has never had it so good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_126.wav	3.46	We are under no illusions about this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_127.wav	2.95	But the killer remains at large.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_128.wav	3.89	Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_129.wav	3.46	He is adamant that he is innocent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_130.wav	2.31	I had a train to catch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_131.wav	3.07	It is a terrible loss.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_132.wav	2.69	What's happening to her?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_133.wav	2.95	It was even worse than at home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_134.wav	3.24	I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_135.wav	2.82	The plane was in flames
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_136.wav	2.18	We cannot lose it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_137.wav	2.65	I still think he will win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_138.wav	3.08	Elections would follow in about two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_139.wav	3.93	However, this idea is never developed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_140.wav	2.86	I've got to get on with my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_141.wav	2.22	It is a road of death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_142.wav	2.56	Now we look forward to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_143.wav	3.67	These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_144.wav	2.48	We've had an enjoyable adventure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_145.wav	2.73	I have a great respect for her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_146.wav	2.18	I suggest a new plan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_147.wav	2.78	IT takes the biscuit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_148.wav	4.91	But we are not immune to the problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_149.wav	3.59	You're not going to forget something like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_150.wav	3.20	They missed the boat and everyone suffers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_151.wav	2.99	The result is utterly compelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_152.wav	2.78	This is the root of their problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_153.wav	3.29	Other forces were, however, at work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_154.wav	3.59	He also has property interests in the country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_155.wav	3.80	That takes time and games and practice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_156.wav	3.54	If only the acting profession was that simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_157.wav	3.20	It is a new company for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_158.wav	2.73	We should have gone solo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_159.wav	2.48	We don't even know his name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_160.wav	2.73	They have known the hard times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_161.wav	2.95	It is about the script for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_162.wav	2.56	You cannot enter the clubhouse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_163.wav	3.76	The president will not be removed from office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_164.wav	2.10	These are serious matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_165.wav	2.22	Are you all right at the front?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_166.wav	2.90	We want to replicate that success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_167.wav	2.86	It was the first time they met.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_168.wav	1.92	It's been a good year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_169.wav	2.95	I was never alone with her, right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_170.wav	2.35	That will be vital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_171.wav	2.31	It's a technical demand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_172.wav	2.52	It's just a normal life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_173.wav	3.37	I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_174.wav	2.82	This is a very high price.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_175.wav	2.82	He is the example for all of us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_176.wav	2.35	There is no way to do this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_177.wav	3.93	Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_178.wav	3.07	Only one person can claim the credit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_179.wav	4.31	Market research indicates that this is not feasible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_180.wav	2.56	O Neill has delivered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_181.wav	2.90	But there was no going back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_182.wav	2.99	We will reform the welfare state.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_183.wav	3.54	Progress is being made but it is slow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_184.wav	2.77	We didn't think anything would happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_185.wav	2.18	He had come of age.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_186.wav	2.69	We were a shambles at the back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_187.wav	2.90	It's not before time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_188.wav	3.80	One of these problems is the railways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_189.wav	2.86	It is a very sad day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_190.wav	2.99	A crucial moment has arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_191.wav	2.39	I have nothing to hide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_192.wav	3.12	Next time round, it will be different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_193.wav	2.56	How can they get one?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_194.wav	2.60	Only local people are helping.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_195.wav	2.86	We had to work hard for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_196.wav	3.41	John Lennon is a very large industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_197.wav	2.27	This is my homeland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_198.wav	2.65	You saw the pain he was in.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_199.wav	4.18	Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_200.wav	2.69	Drugs are always an issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_201.wav	3.59	Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_202.wav	3.03	Three weeks later, he resigned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_203.wav	2.39	It has affected me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_204.wav	2.95	She made no further comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_205.wav	2.65	I have no conflict with them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_206.wav	2.56	The next one comes up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_207.wav	3.07	She was close to suicide at one stage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_208.wav	2.91	We've got better players here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_209.wav	3.72	There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_210.wav	3.59	We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_211.wav	2.82	People have no chance of getting out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_212.wav	2.69	I am appalled by this news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_213.wav	2.78	We were extremely arrogant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_214.wav	3.08	Obviously, we would want to look at this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_215.wav	3.29	I was just getting over the time difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_216.wav	2.86	I am proud of moments like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_217.wav	4.40	Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_218.wav	3.50	No-one expected that their parents would stay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_219.wav	3.54	We're looking for unity in the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_220.wav	3.25	The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_221.wav	2.69	You cannot allow it to go on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_222.wav	2.69	It's up to the defence team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_223.wav	3.63	I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_224.wav	3.12	No means testing will be required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_225.wav	3.42	He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_226.wav	3.33	I don't think that's very fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_227.wav	2.05	He was on a horse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_228.wav	2.82	Human beings are always the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_229.wav	3.46	Then there's the problem of sympathy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_230.wav	3.25	If only he knew himself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_231.wav	3.24	This action could have been avoided.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_232.wav	2.73	I watched a game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_233.wav	2.65	Anyone else can apply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_234.wav	2.77	It was like the old days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_235.wav	2.82	This was never a support group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_236.wav	2.90	The first time you read a play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_237.wav	2.73	I was a little surprised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_238.wav	2.22	This is my home town.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_239.wav	2.56	That was six years ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_240.wav	2.99	Nothing can bring back their son.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_241.wav	2.99	It is up to us to approve it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_242.wav	3.50	His musicals were very much of their time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_243.wav	2.35	They might well be right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_244.wav	3.16	There is great demand for human cloning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_245.wav	3.03	The balance isn't there at EMI.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_246.wav	2.56	It starts to get you down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_247.wav	3.59	We didn't play well and will certainly improve.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_248.wav	2.90	My life has been turned upside down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_249.wav	3.58	The years of campaigning have been very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_250.wav	2.95	I have played well the past two days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_251.wav	3.29	I said, What was that about?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_252.wav	2.22	This could prove a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_253.wav	3.97	He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_254.wav	2.35	His game was complete.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_255.wav	3.67	What does she consider her greatest achievement?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_256.wav	2.78	This is too much like Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_257.wav	2.95	He's been here on numerous occasions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_258.wav	3.84	That goes back a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_259.wav	3.21	I wouldn't have had the abandon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_260.wav	3.42	They were not at the property yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_261.wav	2.61	We will not tolerate it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_262.wav	2.99	It should not make the same mistake again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_263.wav	2.61	They loved it and it showed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_264.wav	3.67	However, by then the damage had been done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_265.wav	3.93	As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_266.wav	3.16	Have we not been here before?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_267.wav	2.73	Just what we didn't need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_268.wav	3.16	Inquiries are still in an early stage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_269.wav	2.56	It is a very beautiful city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_270.wav	3.89	She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_271.wav	3.54	The company reacted very, very well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_272.wav	2.69	Her body was found on Monday morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_273.wav	2.86	The issues are very intense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_274.wav	2.48	It won't be their last.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_275.wav	2.95	You've got to have both sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_276.wav	2.39	I'll tell you honestly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_277.wav	2.52	Dialogue is the key.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_278.wav	2.69	It has been only average.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_279.wav	2.48	He should be worried about me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_280.wav	2.86	That never happens in real life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_281.wav	3.33	I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_282.wav	2.35	That was the gimmick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_283.wav	2.99	This is a national crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_284.wav	2.90	He has changed my life forever.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_285.wav	3.72	Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_286.wav	3.63	In Europe, it is always over two games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_287.wav	3.29	There's a tremendous amount of adventure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_288.wav	3.50	However, we had no failures in our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_289.wav	2.39	This is his first movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_290.wav	3.07	He already had had complaints.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_291.wav	3.33	For that much we must be grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_292.wav	3.20	Spent three months alone at sea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_293.wav	2.39	They are the heroes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_294.wav	3.03	That will be the key to success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_295.wav	2.22	They are in good spirits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_296.wav	3.33	Three hours later, the man was free.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_297.wav	3.97	You can't get the experience in Austria.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_298.wav	2.48	I wonder if Rangers do that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_299.wav	2.35	I'm going to miss it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_300.wav	2.60	The atmosphere was excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_301.wav	3.41	However, the snow was welcomed by some.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_302.wav	3.54	As to rugby, well, no-one knows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_303.wav	2.05	One was a lawyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_304.wav	3.55	Our task is to complete the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_305.wav	2.86	It may have been a cry for help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_306.wav	3.16	His descent was pathetic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_307.wav	3.42	By now he was very ill with cancer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_308.wav	2.99	But let's not get carried away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_309.wav	3.08	It's only tackling congestion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_310.wav	4.48	Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_311.wav	3.20	We've seen that time and time again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_312.wav	3.42	Friends of the family have given their support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_313.wav	3.20	This means a great deal to the families.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_314.wav	3.72	They said that they stood by their statement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_315.wav	2.52	It should be equal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_316.wav	2.78	We are on a four-year mission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_317.wav	3.54	He was always nice to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_318.wav	3.08	Is he going to look after them?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_319.wav	2.61	He had no answer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_320.wav	3.21	Scotland is too small a country for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_321.wav	2.56	Special measures were needed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_322.wav	2.74	Your father was a good man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_323.wav	3.42	You do that because you want to win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_324.wav	2.60	The whole family was in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_325.wav	3.42	This is the last chance, and everyone knows it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_326.wav	2.78	My whole life has changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_327.wav	2.90	They always seem to produce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_328.wav	3.42	He wanted someone young and ambitious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_329.wav	3.12	But everywhere the problems are the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_330.wav	3.33	It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_331.wav	2.61	The company's in good shape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_332.wav	3.46	He became the focus of surrounding interest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_333.wav	1.79	It is out there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_334.wav	2.61	This country has many challenges.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_335.wav	3.08	The best option is to destroy the plants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_336.wav	3.46	I've never had problems with any football managers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_337.wav	2.86	To begin with it looks good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_338.wav	2.69	They are with their father.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_339.wav	2.60	This was a unique election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_340.wav	3.46	The review has been conducted fairly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_341.wav	3.50	They will run in tandem with New Work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_342.wav	3.03	I had to win this race.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_343.wav	2.60	And right now, it isn't there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_344.wav	2.31	The boat was fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_345.wav	2.48	Donald was his friend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_346.wav	4.10	The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_347.wav	2.69	The girls are ready to compete.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_348.wav	3.29	It gives us something to work on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_349.wav	2.94	It was all too little, too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_350.wav	2.86	What's the problem with change?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_351.wav	3.59	Our destiny is in our own hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_352.wav	2.69	There are moments of silence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_353.wav	3.50	Glasgow is about to enter a new era.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_354.wav	3.03	The board of governors must act.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_355.wav	2.95	That didn't happen for two reasons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_356.wav	2.82	It is time for a new approach.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_357.wav	3.42	Now they have decided to have a rethink.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_358.wav	2.65	Tiger is the exception.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_359.wav	2.65	There's no choice is there?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_360.wav	2.05	Does it, Noel?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_361.wav	3.03	Do not forget about Monaco.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_362.wav	2.99	You can't give in to the vandals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_363.wav	2.82	Glasgow is far from overload.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_364.wav	2.22	Everything was an effort.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_365.wav	2.39	And does it even matter?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_366.wav	2.48	My parents are exhausted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_367.wav	3.24	Like his acting, it was an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_368.wav	3.24	That's why he is a national treasure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_369.wav	2.48	I'm delighted for Andy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_370.wav	2.65	And how he kept his word.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_371.wav	3.16	It's their duty to protect them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_372.wav	2.73	The Cup has come home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_373.wav	3.12	This is a big, big win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_374.wav	5.34	As two candidates are proposed, a vote is taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_375.wav	3.20	That's an equally important factor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_376.wav	2.73	We were given a break.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_377.wav	3.89	It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_378.wav	2.14	That would have killed the match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_379.wav	3.16	That's not like us at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_380.wav	3.16	Scottish teams have got to take their chances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_381.wav	3.03	Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_382.wav	2.60	You have to rely on each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_383.wav	2.73	Politics is a tough game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_384.wav	3.46	This season has been a nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_385.wav	3.29	Everyone could see the joke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_386.wav	3.76	He is just a wonderful actor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_387.wav	3.03	Billy knew he was attracted to women.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_388.wav	4.14	The occasion was a conference on Scottish art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_389.wav	3.16	Such cases are on the increase.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_390.wav	2.44	This was not helpful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_391.wav	2.31	The police are not the target.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_392.wav	3.12	It's a true story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_393.wav	4.49	John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_394.wav	2.90	But that title is a mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_395.wav	4.02	It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_396.wav	2.86	I'd rather have been playing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_397.wav	2.52	I am immensely sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_398.wav	3.12	Several others were absent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_399.wav	3.16	It is surprising to come back this way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_400.wav	4.35	Life is about people, and how you feel about people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_401.wav	3.33	Could they perhaps be related?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_402.wav	2.69	We all thought we were going to die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_403.wav	2.73	I knew she was going to win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_404.wav	2.86	What is the Barnett formula?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_405.wav	2.56	Clark is back on top form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_406.wav	2.39	A suspicion was not enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_407.wav	2.99	It will probably be my last, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_408.wav	2.90	I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_409.wav	2.22	It is good for Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_410.wav	2.77	I am looking forward to this film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_411.wav	3.67	Colour was at the core of his life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_412.wav	3.46	They would not tell us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_413.wav	3.07	The balance is all wrong in this country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_414.wav	3.76	This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_415.wav	3.37	It is my decision and my decision alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_416.wav	2.09	A venue was found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_417.wav	3.37	I will always remember the horrible images.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_418.wav	3.84	It can happen to you, it can happen to anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_419.wav	2.56	But a surprise is in store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_420.wav	2.22	You can cope with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_421.wav	2.52	He was back to square one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_422.wav	3.16	We didn't get any from his face.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_423.wav	3.25	But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p292\p292_424.wav	3.29	It's time for a change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_001.wav	2.26	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_002.wav	4.95	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_003.wav	9.05	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_004.wav	6.27	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_005.wav	7.60	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_006.wav	6.83	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_007.wav	5.08	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_008.wav	8.58	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_009.wav	5.76	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_010.wav	4.40	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_011.wav	8.15	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_012.wav	5.76	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_013.wav	5.08	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_014.wav	7.34	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_015.wav	8.15	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_016.wav	11.57	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_018.wav	9.09	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_019.wav	10.24	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_020.wav	6.83	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_021.wav	10.54	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_022.wav	8.71	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_023.wav	12.89	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_024.wav	8.71	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_025.wav	4.52	It's not, of course, a concert hall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_026.wav	4.01	Theatre is not a museum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_027.wav	5.17	It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_028.wav	3.84	All my training is for Athens.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_029.wav	3.93	Subs not used, McCulloch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_030.wav	4.44	I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_032.wav	3.89	We are satisfied with this outcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_033.wav	4.01	Several others were absent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_034.wav	4.57	I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_035.wav	3.59	There is a lot of heroin about.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_036.wav	4.44	There is a growing anger among the group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_037.wav	4.35	I have got to adopt the same approach.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_038.wav	4.57	Seven people were later detained by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_039.wav	3.72	It's a sensible management decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_040.wav	3.80	Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_041.wav	7.47	I would just like someone to confess.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_042.wav	3.76	Sub Not Used, McCormick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_043.wav	3.76	We can be proud of our achievements.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_044.wav	3.07	Clark is back on top form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_045.wav	4.10	He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_046.wav	4.27	Lothian and Borders Police are also involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_047.wav	2.86	That was the theory, anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_048.wav	3.42	Ferguson must take the blame.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_049.wav	3.84	This is thought to mean sometime next week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_050.wav	4.74	In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_051.wav	5.77	Stealing from the benefits system is no different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_052.wav	4.87	It is a large number.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_053.wav	6.32	We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_054.wav	4.35	General, You didn't get a modified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_055.wav	6.53	It does not even have a staff shortage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_056.wav	4.78	That is our unfinished business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_057.wav	4.40	This is far too high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_058.wav	5.68	The Cabinet is split over the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_059.wav	6.57	In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_060.wav	3.37	But the foundations have been laid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_061.wav	6.23	This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_062.wav	4.78	So they will settle again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_063.wav	8.11	He had other things on his mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_064.wav	4.65	Why did it take a concerted campaign?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_065.wav	2.73	Let us hope so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_066.wav	4.82	It can happen to you, it can happen to anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_067.wav	5.08	A lot of people had to wait, and people still do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_068.wav	4.31	It felt like my support system was leaving.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_069.wav	5.68	A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_070.wav	4.22	I was shaking on the blocks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_071.wav	4.69	So the challenge is against ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_072.wav	3.03	You see, my back has gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_073.wav	4.10	It has been a lovely family occasion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_074.wav	3.63	We've had our problems at the club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_075.wav	4.18	His behaviour today has been disgusting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_076.wav	3.67	More than half of the school collapsed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_077.wav	3.80	We also hope to meet the men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_078.wav	3.41	I can live with just the one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_079.wav	3.76	All the people thought that we would die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_080.wav	5.12	Sometimes they come off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_081.wav	5.72	A teacher is, really, about unity.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_082.wav	5.81	Our nation has been changed by this event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_083.wav	6.02	However, my position remains the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_084.wav	3.42	However, it's good to turn the page.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_085.wav	6.23	There are plenty examples.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_086.wav	5.68	Self control is just one instalment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_087.wav	4.14	It's an hour of the same response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_088.wav	3.89	I could not believe what they were saying.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_089.wav	4.22	A hard act to follow, but it is being followed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_090.wav	3.20	Will he be given time?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_091.wav	6.83	Beyond that would have been outrageous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_092.wav	6.53	I seem to keep this for the majors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_093.wav	5.63	The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_094.wav	5.04	We've been overwhelmed by the response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_095.wav	5.21	Her presence was almost everywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_096.wav	5.16	But the cost to his health was enormous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_097.wav	2.56	It has been hijacked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_098.wav	3.97	And he's the first to see that, and say that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_099.wav	4.91	They must put them back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_100.wav	5.64	You do have a way out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_101.wav	4.78	Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_102.wav	3.71	This is not a European Army.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_103.wav	4.69	These guys are looking for business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_104.wav	4.83	And, also, when he does not have the ball.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_105.wav	4.19	I have also been delighted with Stevie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_106.wav	4.23	It was different in the endurance events.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_107.wav	4.06	They will now have to justify their position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_108.wav	4.57	It didn't help him, as far as we had seen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_109.wav	4.99	The objective was achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_110.wav	4.78	So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_111.wav	5.00	Look at his last couple of records.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_112.wav	9.00	There is no musical background in his family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_113.wav	4.69	The cost of war is more than that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_114.wav	5.33	You, the British people, are the boss.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_115.wav	6.91	The door is open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_116.wav	5.59	PR for Westminster is their holy grail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_117.wav	4.02	She doesn't know me, know anything about me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_118.wav	5.55	These are long-term investments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_119.wav	6.70	Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_120.wav	4.95	He also wants to play in this game, and that's important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_121.wav	9.99	This is excellent news for Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_122.wav	5.08	If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_123.wav	3.46	Eriksson would have approved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_124.wav	6.15	You ask the question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_125.wav	7.13	Next league matches, Motherwell Dunfermline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_126.wav	5.98	Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_127.wav	4.95	The Taliban response was swift.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_128.wav	8.02	Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_129.wav	7.81	In fact, they should have scored three times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_130.wav	5.17	They have their own interests and techniques.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_131.wav	4.91	Well, it was part of our ongoing discussions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_132.wav	4.27	The firm was down and almost out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_133.wav	6.96	Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_134.wav	3.76	Fifteen minutes later, they were found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_135.wav	7.00	It was very, very difficult for me to look at this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_136.wav	9.69	That is why we are here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_137.wav	6.45	Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_138.wav	4.61	Somehow they got out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_139.wav	6.06	The house was so well alight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_140.wav	4.27	I've been very nervous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_141.wav	4.01	Ireland is also prepared to take in refugees.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_142.wav	7.64	However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_143.wav	5.21	The proposals were never taken seriously.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_144.wav	2.95	The Treasury denied the claims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_145.wav	3.12	The same goes for McKenna.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_146.wav	6.40	Perhaps it should stay there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_147.wav	4.91	You can be sure we will have problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_148.wav	5.12	Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_149.wav	5.89	We had to take action to protect them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_150.wav	3.80	We have no idea what caused the derailment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_151.wav	2.43	Our policy is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_152.wav	3.46	I think we have a very strong case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_153.wav	5.42	Who would be out there, singing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_154.wav	5.59	It is very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_155.wav	3.54	However, his remarks were heavily qualified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_156.wav	4.95	It's something he has worked very hard on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_157.wav	4.78	Horses have some sense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_158.wav	5.12	Last night, the extent of the damage was emerging.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_159.wav	3.71	Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_160.wav	3.84	The only answer is a public inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_161.wav	3.93	Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_162.wav	4.44	However, the great thing is that it doesn't matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_163.wav	3.50	Politics is a tough game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_164.wav	4.35	Darrell was, however, adamant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_165.wav	3.33	The rear of the plane was on fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_166.wav	3.58	It is physical but it is also good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_167.wav	2.78	It's unfair on her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_168.wav	2.60	So, easy does it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_169.wav	3.67	I just want to enjoy myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_170.wav	3.88	We are concerned that things should be safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_171.wav	3.63	At this point we can only speculate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_172.wav	3.80	Family members are at her bedside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_173.wav	3.25	I am very shocked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_174.wav	3.42	The people here are quite reserved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_175.wav	2.52	When will this change?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_176.wav	2.48	It has made me feel good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_177.wav	3.59	It's been such a long haul.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_178.wav	3.08	This gives us a lot of practice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_179.wav	4.61	Sadly, too, many of them are similar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_180.wav	4.31	Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_181.wav	4.65	However, it is believed they were from the Highlands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_182.wav	3.93	Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_183.wav	4.36	The crucial strike was yet to come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_184.wav	3.63	It was his job to check.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_185.wav	3.84	This is the stuff of live music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_186.wav	4.10	Mrs Taylor is taking legal advice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_187.wav	4.70	Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_188.wav	3.89	But Allen is deadly serious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_189.wav	3.33	It's a huge amount.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_190.wav	4.01	The fire was falling from the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_191.wav	4.27	So he was anxious to try something new.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_192.wav	3.88	But he is something special, is he not?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_193.wav	3.63	This is simply unjust.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_194.wav	5.21	A final decision is expected by Friday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_195.wav	3.08	We will do so again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_196.wav	3.25	We will only move forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_197.wav	3.12	I'm a bit annoyed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_198.wav	3.50	It ignores the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_199.wav	3.24	I am just looking to God.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_200.wav	4.18	I always savour the company of The Voice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_201.wav	2.26	What's the rush?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_202.wav	3.42	It would also take time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_203.wav	3.93	Nothing is ruled out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_204.wav	4.23	We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_205.wav	3.93	He doesn't have to like it, but he must accept it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_206.wav	4.31	I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_207.wav	3.58	He was also married with two children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_208.wav	3.20	His conclusion is upbeat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_209.wav	3.55	Clearly, we could go on like this all day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_210.wav	4.10	The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_211.wav	3.71	Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_212.wav	3.03	I'm just gonna hit the shot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_213.wav	3.93	He will not be carrying out any surgery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_214.wav	5.25	The replacements made a big difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_215.wav	3.24	We expect to come through on Thursday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_216.wav	3.08	A web site's planned for November.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_217.wav	3.67	He didn't know it was his audition, but it was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_218.wav	5.34	The salary changes are long overdue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_219.wav	5.25	He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_220.wav	3.84	Who would be in that desert?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_221.wav	4.40	It will take some time to establish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_222.wav	4.01	Sadly the jury were not convinced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_223.wav	2.65	We never got off the bus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_224.wav	3.76	I've had six days of rehearsal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_225.wav	4.06	Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_226.wav	4.27	They have to come up with a solution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_227.wav	4.10	The report will be launched in Glasgow today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_228.wav	3.97	These will be finally corrected by next week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_229.wav	2.73	They will form a tribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_230.wav	3.54	We had no idea that this letter existed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_231.wav	3.50	I think in three dimensions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_232.wav	3.03	Three others were wounded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_233.wav	3.12	They had four children together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_234.wav	3.63	It's a way of making a mark.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_235.wav	3.89	There is a great carry over value.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_236.wav	5.21	Life, as many people know it, in other words.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_237.wav	3.25	That was my own personal decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_238.wav	3.59	For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_239.wav	3.72	She returned home a few days later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_240.wav	3.63	I have been here for only three months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_241.wav	3.08	So what's wrong with Scotland?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_242.wav	4.69	She had been in Germany for medical treatment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_243.wav	4.57	How can they engage with the work?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_244.wav	4.40	It gave me something to focus on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_245.wav	3.76	We live by the rule of law.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_246.wav	4.40	He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_247.wav	3.37	She is fulfilled by it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_248.wav	3.88	But one shouldn't go by that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_249.wav	3.63	Nobody has been put on trial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_250.wav	4.01	Advice and counselling will be offered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_251.wav	3.63	Also, he was flawed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_252.wav	3.80	That's why he plays for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_253.wav	3.55	I just could not cope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_254.wav	4.18	They may differ on other issues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_255.wav	3.84	In short, the club was broke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_256.wav	4.95	The protest will go ahead as planned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_257.wav	4.69	There is no dispute with the Iraqi people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_258.wav	6.06	That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_259.wav	4.31	I find the whole affair disturbing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_260.wav	3.71	Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_261.wav	4.14	Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_262.wav	3.16	The Commons is too outdated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_263.wav	3.50	It feels like a privilege.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_264.wav	3.29	We have got a full house tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_265.wav	4.44	It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_266.wav	2.95	He will be advised by me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_267.wav	3.89	It's been quite a turnaround for Miami.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_268.wav	3.46	Our children are our future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_269.wav	2.86	It's part of your life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_270.wav	4.18	The defender made an impressive debut.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_271.wav	3.54	I was furious about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_272.wav	3.80	They were not doing it too well, either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_273.wav	3.50	It is typical of me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_274.wav	4.10	There are two offerings from Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_275.wav	3.08	Life becomes a song.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_276.wav	3.93	I know you went back this morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_277.wav	3.93	It has, however, been a long time coming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_278.wav	3.20	This avalanche is just beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_279.wav	4.02	That, however, is only part of their story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_280.wav	4.40	Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_281.wav	2.90	I was living with my mum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_282.wav	3.80	We very much regret that it has occurred.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_283.wav	3.20	The whole process was so different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_284.wav	3.33	The BBC was a disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_285.wav	3.37	They feel it belongs to them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_286.wav	3.50	I don't know why she is not here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_287.wav	3.33	They certainly do not socialise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_288.wav	4.14	Police have refused to name the couple involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_289.wav	4.14	They have got their position, we have got our position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_290.wav	4.27	There was still more disquiet in Israel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_291.wav	3.97	He had played well in that central role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_292.wav	2.61	We told them in June.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_293.wav	3.63	If so, we want to hear from them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_294.wav	3.59	They never gave up hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_295.wav	4.10	Construction is due to begin in February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_296.wav	4.61	I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_297.wav	4.40	It was just another race, and yesterday is history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_298.wav	3.29	The red card was okay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_300.wav	4.10	We remain committed to it, as does the government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_301.wav	3.03	But they will not be compelled to join.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_302.wav	3.03	It will vote with the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_303.wav	3.37	There will be no disruption to teaching.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_304.wav	3.97	Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_305.wav	3.54	No, we had nothing to do with the Jews.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_306.wav	3.37	Again the verdict was not proven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_307.wav	3.67	We've just got to work a bit better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_308.wav	3.88	The likelihood is that it will be negative.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_309.wav	4.18	That suggests that out fitness is good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_310.wav	4.36	But she's also beautiful behind the face.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_311.wav	3.93	Four had been brought down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_312.wav	4.40	The British public is nothing if not fickle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_313.wav	4.83	Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_314.wav	4.06	It is also claimed that he was murdered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_315.wav	4.40	We will build upon the basic state pension.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_316.wav	3.42	Last year, however, was a different story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_317.wav	4.65	I'm confident we can turn things around.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_318.wav	3.88	Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_319.wav	3.97	Frankly, they have to crack down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_320.wav	3.80	Eleven events are required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_321.wav	4.61	The ministers are now to make their decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_322.wav	4.06	The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_323.wav	4.01	That's just the kind of thing we have.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_324.wav	3.89	I bought a car at auction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_325.wav	3.80	You've gotten all the facts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_326.wav	9.26	It possibly depends on the position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_327.wav	3.80	Life is too short.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_328.wav	7.42	What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_329.wav	4.82	The event has now gone to Helsinki.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_330.wav	5.72	He's very young but he is growing up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_331.wav	3.97	He is in charge on the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_332.wav	4.53	Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_333.wav	4.65	SOMETIMES, it's not what you say that counts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_334.wav	4.99	For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_335.wav	4.82	They had asked not to be named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_336.wav	4.10	Well, until recently he didn't think so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_337.wav	3.29	A whole range of factors are involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_338.wav	3.88	There may be some work in construction, but not enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_339.wav	3.07	They would love to do more films.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_340.wav	3.46	I have great sympathy with these people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_341.wav	3.08	He wanted someone young and ambitious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_342.wav	4.31	Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_343.wav	3.46	It raises a serious question mark.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_344.wav	2.86	He is dying from cancer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_345.wav	3.97	The package has been properly costed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_346.wav	3.59	The attitude and commitment was decent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_347.wav	2.82	The feeling is awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_348.wav	2.35	He quit in October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_349.wav	3.63	The family also declined to discuss the case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_350.wav	2.99	Famously, though, there was a catch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_351.wav	3.59	Today, we begin to answer that question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_352.wav	2.99	Barry will be able to handle this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_354.wav	3.97	Failure is a curious concept.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_355.wav	3.84	But it can happen for Tiger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_356.wav	4.06	Patients will be partners in decision making.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_357.wav	3.71	We're very excited and challenged by the project.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_358.wav	4.05	The science is well known, the solution is simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_359.wav	3.37	The initial reaction was disbelief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_360.wav	3.80	All these things have an impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_361.wav	4.01	For some, it might not make too much difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_362.wav	3.76	I now know that from memory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_363.wav	3.71	She is believed to be in South Africa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_364.wav	3.59	I felt we had fallen back a little.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_365.wav	3.63	He doesn't even know who he is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_366.wav	3.33	This is our chance in Northern Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_367.wav	3.33	Hopefully, the goals will return on Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_368.wav	11.40	The men are safe and unharmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_369.wav	4.78	I don't know what we're doing wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_370.wav	4.61	I can't wait for the outdoors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_371.wav	4.65	It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_372.wav	3.88	His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_373.wav	2.99	But it was to no avail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_374.wav	3.89	I don't think the referees are against us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_375.wav	3.08	The whole experience has left me bitter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_376.wav	3.46	It is not a road of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_377.wav	4.10	This must be kept in total perspective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_378.wav	3.84	It is three years at present.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_379.wav	3.55	My husband was fighting for his life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_380.wav	4.14	As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_381.wav	3.63	When he took over it really took off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_382.wav	4.48	A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_383.wav	3.67	The penalty was the turning point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_384.wav	3.29	I have chosen to do this research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_385.wav	3.59	It was even worse than at home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_386.wav	3.72	Michael's putting on a brave face.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_387.wav	4.27	This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_388.wav	3.59	I am sure that this will happen again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_389.wav	4.14	He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_390.wav	4.01	All were within range of Israeli cities.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_391.wav	2.99	I do not believe they are.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_392.wav	3.07	The aircraft was totally destroyed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_393.wav	3.84	What happens when the funding is exhausted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_394.wav	3.46	She's the runner - she makes the decisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_395.wav	4.05	This is a completely new experience for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_396.wav	3.50	I should never have come over to Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_397.wav	3.12	What kind of person is he?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_398.wav	2.73	Their bid was a very good one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_399.wav	3.76	Green is desperate to play in The Open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p293\p293_400.wav	3.12	And this tournament will travel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_001.wav	2.73	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_002.wav	5.72	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_003.wav	8.54	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_004.wav	5.56	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_005.wav	8.20	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_006.wav	9.44	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_007.wav	6.45	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_008.wav	9.26	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_009.wav	6.10	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_010.wav	4.06	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_011.wav	7.98	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_012.wav	5.59	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_013.wav	6.15	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_014.wav	6.24	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_015.wav	6.54	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_016.wav	7.64	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_017.wav	5.33	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_018.wav	6.79	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_019.wav	8.28	Since then physicists have found that it's not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_020.wav	4.49	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_021.wav	10.93	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_022.wav	8.88	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_023.wav	14.61	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_024.wav	7.94	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_025.wav	4.05	They were the better team on the night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_026.wav	4.86	The show is sold out, like the others in the run.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_027.wav	3.84	It means we have to have some patience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_028.wav	4.40	For the moment, our position remains the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_029.wav	2.90	I was pregnant and very worried.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_030.wav	2.99	He said she was mad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_031.wav	3.84	They were impressive against France.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_032.wav	3.71	I am delighted at Murray's appointment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_033.wav	3.29	The airport was even different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_034.wav	3.16	Other people had looked at it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_035.wav	3.55	A neighbour said the street was shocked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_036.wav	2.82	Michael, he is running!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_037.wav	4.31	He was taken to hospital, but later died.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_038.wav	4.01	Their ambition is to go back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_039.wav	3.72	He got the same story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_040.wav	4.18	My view has now changed completely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_041.wav	4.23	I've been dying for an hour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_042.wav	3.50	It wasn't a flight of fancy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_043.wav	4.27	We're playing away from home and that's it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_044.wav	4.82	I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_045.wav	3.37	They tend to be female and retired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_046.wav	3.55	Who was the mystery MP?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_047.wav	3.16	This was no accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_048.wav	4.14	I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_049.wav	3.12	We've all done it!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_050.wav	3.29	In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_051.wav	4.06	Hopefully, that'll come from someone on our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_052.wav	3.25	The course record was in his name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_053.wav	2.44	But we welcome this document.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_054.wav	4.23	What is the point of jailing him?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_055.wav	3.88	We should not bring him into a dispute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_056.wav	3.72	This is a possible way forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_057.wav	4.23	I am not here to get even.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_058.wav	4.44	Freedom from Serbia is a growing objective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_059.wav	3.25	We are only human.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_060.wav	2.99	I went with the mood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_061.wav	3.33	I think we'll just keep it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_062.wav	3.67	Debate is not just talk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_063.wav	3.84	How is he enjoying life as a senior?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_064.wav	4.18	It is all about having physical evidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_065.wav	4.14	People remember the Tories in office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_066.wav	3.93	What kind of inclusion is that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_067.wav	3.42	I fell in love with it right away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_068.wav	4.53	Domestic abuse is related to power and control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_069.wav	4.23	It makes for an interesting conference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_070.wav	3.97	I don't have any answer for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_071.wav	3.76	It took about five or six hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_072.wav	3.42	I found the course inspiring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_073.wav	3.63	Two things were clear from the new programme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_074.wav	3.08	This is the real thing now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_075.wav	3.29	Until they came to do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_076.wav	3.03	She now lives in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_077.wav	3.63	It will not be a long campaign.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_078.wav	4.74	Subs not used, McGraw.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_079.wav	3.33	Three bystanders were killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_080.wav	3.07	One policeman was killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_081.wav	3.63	They could not have done more for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_082.wav	2.99	It was like a vacuum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_083.wav	3.16	That was enough for the committee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_084.wav	4.82	It is a very genuine prospect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_085.wav	3.20	It is the tip of the iceberg.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_086.wav	3.76	We have to focus on what is important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_087.wav	3.76	They have to work so hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_088.wav	3.12	It's not very pretty, but it's effective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_089.wav	4.27	Seven British members of the club are missing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_090.wav	3.54	He had just returned from a run.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_091.wav	3.46	There's a strong involvement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_092.wav	3.76	Now, though, he has an incentive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_093.wav	2.91	But now it's back to golf.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_094.wav	3.41	It should be a condition of employment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_095.wav	3.12	Was it a signal?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_096.wav	3.80	It may not even be possible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_097.wav	3.46	In fact, they go hand in hand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_098.wav	4.01	I gave him a way out, and he took it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_099.wav	3.72	So is that it, then?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_100.wav	3.16	You should have let it write the cards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_101.wav	2.91	It's annoying in a way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_102.wav	2.82	It's too close to call.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_103.wav	3.12	It's a long process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_104.wav	3.54	I asked to take it up to Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_105.wav	3.72	Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_106.wav	3.46	The other conditions were not specified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_107.wav	2.95	I've never felt affection for Emu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_108.wav	3.54	That's not part of the deal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_109.wav	3.42	That was the context of his remarks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_110.wav	3.21	This has gone on too long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_111.wav	3.84	We have great confidence in Derek.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_112.wav	3.55	My ambition is to tell a good story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_113.wav	3.46	I don't know the nature of the illness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_114.wav	3.37	The industry will try to get round it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_115.wav	3.46	Who will deliver more service to Scotland?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_116.wav	3.52	I want to make a vigorous defence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_117.wav	2.57	And she got it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_118.wav	3.42	We are the weakest link.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_119.wav	3.54	We have now no choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_120.wav	3.67	My father and mother are.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_121.wav	3.16	We don't know what happened after.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_122.wav	3.33	Did he just want to be on telly?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_123.wav	2.93	He seems to be used to the attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_124.wav	3.50	It's an hour of the same response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_125.wav	3.89	We have very real concerns about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_126.wav	2.88	He has gone through the process before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_127.wav	3.42	People will see this over time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_128.wav	2.39	I can't speak for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_129.wav	5.25	They were married in Edinburgh last summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_130.wav	3.84	The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_131.wav	3.42	I can't see him reversing that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_132.wav	2.65	I'm deeply sorry they did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_133.wav	3.37	I can lead by example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_134.wav	3.80	I have had a wonderful career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_135.wav	2.86	It seemed to have direction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_136.wav	2.82	This takes the pressure off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_137.wav	3.72	It was different in the endurance events.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_138.wav	3.84	Above all, the approach is upbeat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_139.wav	2.86	The objective was achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_140.wav	3.89	It was a hugely popular decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_141.wav	3.29	He invented the language.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_142.wav	2.52	Where are they?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_143.wav	2.61	It's hard not to.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_144.wav	3.93	It is a question of life and death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_145.wav	3.93	However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_146.wav	2.82	You ask the question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_147.wav	3.54	She was always a quality act.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_148.wav	3.33	We are all very proud of her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_149.wav	2.69	I'm sure that is not.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_150.wav	3.37	It's a great idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_151.wav	3.16	It's like a score in some ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_152.wav	2.95	It's a wonderful piece of water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_153.wav	2.90	Feel the air, the space.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_154.wav	3.16	Therein lies the problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_155.wav	2.69	You feel the pride.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_156.wav	3.33	We are well insured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_157.wav	3.54	I was quietly confident about getting the win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_158.wav	3.29	The Treasury denied the claims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_159.wav	3.16	You've been working for four years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_160.wav	2.74	I am the Son of Sam.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_161.wav	3.80	There is no shortage of commitment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_162.wav	3.33	Such as it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_163.wav	3.16	He deserves a second chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_164.wav	2.95	He also admitted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_165.wav	4.10	There was no change in the strategy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_166.wav	3.67	There's been a mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_167.wav	2.99	It had until tomorrow to comply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_168.wav	3.67	Genetic assessment is crucial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_169.wav	2.69	I enjoy my work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_170.wav	3.46	We have managed to get it under control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_171.wav	3.84	We have a genuine budget in place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_172.wav	3.41	Art is still a risky investment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_173.wav	2.95	It was little else.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_174.wav	3.54	These things can happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_175.wav	3.84	Family members are at her bedside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_176.wav	3.42	You have to go to the edges.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_177.wav	3.76	I'm looking forward to facing the Irishmen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_178.wav	3.08	Harry will be up for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_179.wav	2.48	He could tell you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_180.wav	3.16	My place is in the kitchen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_181.wav	4.01	He was, indeed, a thoroughly decent man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_182.wav	4.44	A decision is expected in September.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_183.wav	3.16	It was a big departure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_184.wav	3.20	That's the name of the game, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_185.wav	3.16	It's a huge amount.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_186.wav	3.03	The fire was falling from the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_187.wav	2.22	I want my mum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_188.wav	3.46	This is simply unjust.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_189.wav	3.29	The First Minister is an addict.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_190.wav	3.89	Its role is not to interfere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_191.wav	1.98	It is becoming a bit of a habit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_192.wav	2.91	You can't believe a word.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_193.wav	3.50	Something happened on that island.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_194.wav	2.82	You can't get a mortgage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_195.wav	3.24	It is misleading to compare the two.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_196.wav	2.60	I want a career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_197.wav	2.90	He said nothing to waiting journalists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_198.wav	3.37	O Leary was clearly disgusted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_199.wav	3.24	That's been the case for a while.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_200.wav	3.46	When it is ready, it will be signed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_201.wav	3.59	All options are on the table.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_202.wav	3.67	It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_203.wav	3.80	We now have a moment of hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_204.wav	3.63	They should not be blamed for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_205.wav	3.71	Our traditions and cultures remain the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_206.wav	3.80	The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_207.wav	2.86	It will take some time to establish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_208.wav	2.86	This club is perfect for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_209.wav	4.48	And do you know, it just wasn't the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_210.wav	4.10	This came as no great surprise to anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_211.wav	2.99	I love this job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_212.wav	2.73	I have no secrets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_213.wav	3.80	We are very, very pleased with the response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_214.wav	4.01	He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_215.wav	2.86	They will form a tribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_216.wav	3.63	We're very, very excited.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_217.wav	4.02	It's not a question of talking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_218.wav	3.63	He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_219.wav	3.76	Then they killed another three.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_220.wav	4.52	We are not a retailer, we provide a service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_221.wav	3.16	The six others were injured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_222.wav	3.16	She has so much to offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_223.wav	4.61	They are not the answer to staff shortages.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_224.wav	4.06	It should be a pretty exciting session.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_225.wav	2.99	Gas is too expensive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_226.wav	3.50	Advice and counselling will be offered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_227.wav	3.33	Are we going mainstream?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_228.wav	3.20	I could not believe what they were saying.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_229.wav	3.41	The protest will go ahead as planned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_230.wav	2.86	Who will run the bigger show?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_231.wav	4.57	General, You didn't get a modified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_232.wav	2.60	I'm not a little girl.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_233.wav	4.14	We have seen the future, and it is different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_234.wav	3.80	Who does he think will win?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_235.wav	2.86	We're talking about one or two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_236.wav	3.03	I just have to accept that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_237.wav	3.01	He was overwhelmed by the response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_238.wav	3.84	They will do nothing for the local people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_239.wav	3.12	Do it for us now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_240.wav	3.16	We got the guarantee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_241.wav	2.86	I couldn't have asked for better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_242.wav	3.33	That is however, the only part of the story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_243.wav	2.95	But happily, the story is true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_244.wav	2.52	They are not suitable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_245.wav	3.16	Some days are different from others.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_247.wav	2.68	Everything else is the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_248.wav	3.89	They never gave up hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_249.wav	2.95	But it was a pleasure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_250.wav	3.93	There are no excuses left for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_251.wav	3.72	Mental health is a massive issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_252.wav	3.63	His director of football is leaving.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_253.wav	3.46	We don't want to be too intrusive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_254.wav	3.93	Their own instinctive response was confirmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_255.wav	3.54	There are still some matters to be discussed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_256.wav	3.76	This would give Scotland around eight members.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_257.wav	3.63	I get on him, he gets on me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_258.wav	3.20	They are in care for a reason.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_259.wav	3.55	A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_260.wav	2.39	I haven't a clue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_261.wav	4.27	It has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_262.wav	3.16	I thought he was terrific.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_263.wav	3.71	A statement is expected in April.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_264.wav	3.59	It possibly depends on the position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_265.wav	3.67	This will have no effect on the championship.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_266.wav	3.89	We didn't turn it into the inspectors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_267.wav	2.78	I would love to travel with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_268.wav	3.46	Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_269.wav	3.54	It is a common condition in children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_270.wav	3.08	We will work through the night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_271.wav	3.54	I also thought, This is a feature film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_272.wav	3.72	For now, they have gone as far as they can.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_273.wav	4.10	Boy is the town a mess.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_274.wav	2.39	It's as simple as that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_275.wav	3.25	We've been here before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_276.wav	3.71	Neither of them was badly hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_277.wav	4.02	From there, it was a success story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_278.wav	4.14	It is a very disturbing picture for men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_279.wav	4.27	I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_280.wav	3.12	It was one in the afternoon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_281.wav	3.71	I've never seen them down here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_282.wav	4.14	For some, it might not make too much difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_283.wav	3.33	This is our unfinished business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_284.wav	3.67	This is our chance in Northern Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_285.wav	4.10	He had asked if they had the script.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_286.wav	6.75	It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_287.wav	3.63	This could take a few days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_288.wav	3.16	A great deal was achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_289.wav	2.61	So it was sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_290.wav	3.46	It's a blunt instrument anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_291.wav	3.38	There did not need to be a miracle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_292.wav	3.84	This could also affect the sentencing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_293.wav	3.97	That case has still not been settled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_294.wav	2.90	What do they do, anyway?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_295.wav	3.42	They've got a mountain to climb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_296.wav	3.29	It just would not work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_297.wav	3.63	The acting left a lot to be desired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_298.wav	3.20	Who will provide the wine?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_299.wav	2.99	We started from scratch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_300.wav	2.99	There was no happiness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_301.wav	2.95	Their bid was a very good one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_302.wav	3.59	Everything is so commercial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_303.wav	3.25	And this tournament will travel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_304.wav	3.16	Could it have been better spent?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_305.wav	4.48	If that is the case, it is a breakthrough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_306.wav	2.52	The order went out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_307.wav	3.16	Cinema is a communal experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_308.wav	3.03	The appeal is impartial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_309.wav	3.29	You could see he was thinking about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_310.wav	3.88	He added, We are full of anger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_311.wav	3.42	They have nowhere else to go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_312.wav	3.84	However, it seems that he got it wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_313.wav	3.16	We work for the athlete.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_314.wav	3.80	It is three years at present.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_315.wav	4.27	The document is a starting point for discussion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_316.wav	4.23	We all make mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_317.wav	2.90	It didn't put me off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_318.wav	3.29	Now they have found out the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_319.wav	3.16	It is an impressive record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_320.wav	3.16	Johnson was pretty low.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_321.wav	3.03	We know we have done wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_322.wav	3.33	She was married with one son.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_323.wav	2.65	I wanted to drop out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_324.wav	2.26	I told you so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_325.wav	3.71	He's a good player, but he's not the only one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_326.wav	3.50	Which is where the manager comes in.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_327.wav	2.89	Is that what people we want?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_328.wav	3.37	There are so many unanswered questions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_329.wav	3.67	Then it was into a series of classes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_330.wav	3.63	He wants to play in the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_331.wav	2.77	I'm so happy that she did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_332.wav	3.50	The need for further investment is obvious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_333.wav	3.63	Iraq has no interest in war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_334.wav	4.48	It's hard, but we have had so much to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_335.wav	3.67	But it took a lot of bottle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_336.wav	4.35	Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_337.wav	3.20	That period was a struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_338.wav	2.99	No-one else was hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_339.wav	2.48	What's it for?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_340.wav	3.71	Downing Street defended the scale of the awards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_341.wav	4.14	Anything can happen - at any moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_342.wav	4.23	She is an imposing presence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_343.wav	3.16	There are moments of joy in politics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_344.wav	2.86	Is a drug dealer?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_345.wav	2.82	Where are you taking her?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_346.wav	3.16	Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_347.wav	3.03	It's just not our biggest problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_348.wav	4.35	The result could be all down to turnout.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_349.wav	3.03	I'm not going to change from it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_350.wav	2.82	There were no violations.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_351.wav	3.33	That was the type of man he was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_352.wav	2.65	They are not falling now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_353.wav	2.35	They had to explain it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_354.wav	2.73	We didn't mean to kill him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_355.wav	3.42	The support of Britain is assumed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_356.wav	3.20	So far he has not done so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_357.wav	2.90	He completely loses control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_358.wav	3.03	No decision on that was taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_359.wav	2.99	My fitness was very poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_360.wav	2.99	The trial continues today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_361.wav	3.03	People come to see the Highlands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_362.wav	2.73	Europe is a bonus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_363.wav	3.46	It is also used to buy coffins.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_364.wav	3.37	I've got to provide for my family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_365.wav	2.94	Such debate is pointless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_366.wav	3.16	And it had two seats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_367.wav	3.71	Cooking is intricate and complex.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_368.wav	4.06	He found it very hard to understand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_369.wav	3.46	But it would change the context.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_370.wav	3.46	But who was driving it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_371.wav	4.01	We recorded it at our own expense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_372.wav	2.99	But opponents were quick to criticise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_373.wav	2.43	Try to save us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_374.wav	4.01	We also have had to work the dark side, if you will.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_375.wav	3.93	We need to increase the membership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_376.wav	3.67	Social workers are on stand-by to help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_377.wav	3.46	Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_378.wav	2.95	There could be a way back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_379.wav	3.37	He edited the press release.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_380.wav	3.63	Visitors were also impressed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_381.wav	4.35	It was very, very difficult for me to look at this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_382.wav	3.63	Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_383.wav	3.33	Are there muscular problems?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_384.wav	2.86	We had our chances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_385.wav	3.80	However, many questions remained unanswered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_386.wav	3.71	I told her, and she was extremely grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_387.wav	2.31	He is in the queue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_388.wav	2.52	But what is?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_389.wav	3.42	It wasn't about her singing, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_390.wav	3.25	We have other options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_391.wav	3.42	Calvin was back at his best today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_392.wav	2.74	My mind was made up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_393.wav	4.70	Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_394.wav	2.91	And rugby fans can help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_395.wav	3.24	The council's concern is very simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_396.wav	3.12	We are on the path of change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_397.wav	3.08	Rangers didn't turn up, by the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_398.wav	3.67	No other vehicle was involved in the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_399.wav	3.54	It's very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_400.wav	3.33	Of course, it doesn't all come off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_401.wav	3.93	In fact, he should never have been in the field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_402.wav	4.06	He promised a final decision within a fortnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_403.wav	3.12	We will deal with the refugees.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_404.wav	4.27	The pair are no strangers to smashing records.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_405.wav	4.14	It's a tragedy for the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_406.wav	3.20	It was very well received.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_407.wav	2.82	I don't think there's going to be one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_408.wav	2.61	If you could find it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_409.wav	2.95	Such is the ego involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_410.wav	3.93	Mr Wilson has received no such request.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_411.wav	2.91	It raises the edge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_412.wav	2.99	It was not known to myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_413.wav	3.12	It is a delight on every level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_414.wav	3.08	Would it really be good to shorten it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_415.wav	2.61	I don't entirely buy that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_416.wav	4.31	England could not take anything for granted, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_417.wav	3.43	I saw it in a different way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_418.wav	2.95	Or, rather, it isn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_419.wav	3.12	We have every respect for Michelle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_420.wav	3.42	Mr Blunkett was convinced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_421.wav	2.78	The auction will be held tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_422.wav	3.67	It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_423.wav	3.46	Athletics is on a roll in the country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p294\p294_424.wav	4.23	He died at the hands of his captors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_001.wav	1.41	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_002.wav	4.48	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_003.wav	8.96	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_004.wav	5.47	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_005.wav	7.13	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_006.wav	7.26	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_007.wav	5.04	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_008.wav	8.71	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_009.wav	6.02	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_010.wav	3.63	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_011.wav	7.21	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_012.wav	5.55	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_013.wav	4.87	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_014.wav	5.76	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_015.wav	6.57	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_016.wav	7.30	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_017.wav	4.65	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_018.wav	6.06	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_019.wav	8.07	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_020.wav	5.34	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_021.wav	10.06	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_022.wav	7.30	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_025.wav	3.12	It has never been worthwhile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_026.wav	3.50	She was on the edge of breaking point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_027.wav	3.84	However, the following year the cancer returned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_028.wav	2.39	Because we do not need it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_029.wav	4.14	It has been supremely successful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_030.wav	3.76	He's a good player, but he's not the only one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_031.wav	3.54	Which is where the manager comes in.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_032.wav	3.24	Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_033.wav	3.97	Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_034.wav	3.37	We thought we would never see them again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_035.wav	4.02	After that, it's a step into the unknown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_036.wav	3.37	She asked me for the appointment with me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_037.wav	5.89	He must not be removed from office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_038.wav	3.22	That means an extra two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_039.wav	5.25	I think he was nervous to begin with.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_040.wav	4.50	Our children are the future of our society.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_041.wav	2.52	I'm sure he would love it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_042.wav	3.80	A final agreement has not yet been completed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_043.wav	4.27	It's just not our biggest problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_044.wav	3.97	It is just like any other club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_045.wav	3.93	Everything is possible in football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_046.wav	3.63	I'm sure he didn't mean it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_047.wav	0.17	It was very personal and very intimate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_048.wav	3.55	We are going to New Broomfield to win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_049.wav	3.55	Colin is free to speak with other teams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_050.wav	3.97	He declined to give further details.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_051.wav	4.65	I think it was entirely the right decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_052.wav	5.17	Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_053.wav	4.48	For sure we want to win it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_054.wav	4.31	There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_055.wav	3.76	Such debate is pointless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_056.wav	3.93	He is helping police with their inquiries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_057.wav	3.42	We recorded it at our own expense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_058.wav	4.06	A formal decision will be announced within months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_059.wav	3.54	I knew there was a challenge for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_060.wav	4.06	Social workers are on stand-by to help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_061.wav	3.46	I just have no maternal instincts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_062.wav	4.18	If you're going to do it, do it right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_063.wav	3.72	They have a car and cannot afford another.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_064.wav	4.01	It is, after all, a very funny play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_065.wav	4.19	Can you imagine a world without design?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_066.wav	4.18	I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_067.wav	5.55	And he listens to his artists as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_068.wav	3.93	I really couldn't believe it had actually happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_069.wav	3.76	SO now we know the secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_070.wav	3.37	He's right up to a point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_071.wav	3.42	We would have looked out for each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_072.wav	3.37	I had no choice but to leave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_073.wav	3.67	Where does he go from here?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_074.wav	4.95	Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_075.wav	4.44	This time, there were no such rewards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_076.wav	3.80	But then they scored their fourth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_077.wav	3.93	He said, My own position is quite simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_078.wav	2.86	But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_079.wav	4.31	It has to find out what went wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_080.wav	3.67	People are already enjoying it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_081.wav	3.97	We're just delighted to be back on top.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_082.wav	4.35	Or is it the European approach?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_083.wav	3.20	I had found my vision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_084.wav	3.93	Mr Wilson has received no such request.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_085.wav	4.62	However, we have not come to any conclusions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_086.wav	4.87	There is a contract in existence for Allan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_087.wav	3.80	I don't entirely buy that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_088.wav	3.88	We are very hopeful he will be cleared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_089.wav	2.90	It is giving out the wrong message.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_090.wav	3.67	It didn't come as any great surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_091.wav	4.61	For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_092.wav	3.67	As a nation, we must become more active.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_093.wav	3.67	Nothing has changed from the season before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_094.wav	3.29	I'm not thinking too much about the tour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_095.wav	3.93	I had some time with Aston Villa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_096.wav	3.16	We recognise it as a key area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_097.wav	2.61	The mood was euphoric.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_098.wav	3.80	The time of judgment has arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_099.wav	4.74	Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_100.wav	3.16	You can take it almost anywhere and practise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_101.wav	3.72	We want to be separate from our neighbours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_102.wav	4.10	Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_103.wav	3.67	Have you heard anything from Paramount?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_104.wav	4.78	Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_105.wav	3.29	Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_106.wav	3.89	This has been a terrible experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_107.wav	3.50	He had a different agenda entirely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_108.wav	4.74	Casualties are a problem for the Kremlin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_109.wav	4.10	We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_110.wav	4.65	That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_111.wav	4.57	She said she would not welcome the flowers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_112.wav	4.65	It is reform in return for resources.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_113.wav	3.63	It offers a different viewpoint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_114.wav	4.91	The band was good, and it's been a great day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_115.wav	3.63	I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_116.wav	3.93	I have no plans to retire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_117.wav	3.63	The Scots are, however, in good company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_118.wav	4.27	Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_119.wav	4.61	There were far more pressing matters to consider.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_120.wav	3.67	The whole thing in general is moving on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_121.wav	4.06	This is a test of our character.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_122.wav	4.83	They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_123.wav	4.57	If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_124.wav	4.02	It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_125.wav	3.50	The look on his face was something special.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_126.wav	3.84	You have a very persuasive president.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_127.wav	2.65	Sure, we have problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_128.wav	3.33	We will provide immediate access.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_129.wav	4.57	Axis itself was created from that exercise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_130.wav	3.97	Five years later, the deception continued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_131.wav	4.06	Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_132.wav	3.37	I can't see myself in one of those.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_133.wav	4.14	We are pursuing legal action against the government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_134.wav	4.10	I wondered about changing back to rugby.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_135.wav	4.02	He added, We have the same desire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_137.wav	4.06	It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_138.wav	3.72	I haven't had a lesson in four years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_139.wav	3.46	That, however, is the end of the good news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_140.wav	3.97	Seven people were later detained by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_141.wav	3.72	I got very, very tired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_142.wav	2.99	What did you learn in school today?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_143.wav	3.76	He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_144.wav	4.31	It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_145.wav	3.25	He's working hard on that right now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_146.wav	3.16	The jury is still out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_147.wav	4.14	Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_148.wav	4.23	At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_149.wav	4.40	I can't say that this is very usual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_150.wav	4.18	We opened up and everything was gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_151.wav	4.02	However, everyone should do it once in their life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_152.wav	3.76	We are right at the heart of Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_153.wav	3.80	I try to be open to experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_154.wav	3.33	I remember it clearly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_155.wav	3.50	I'm sure they will be very happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_156.wav	4.01	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_157.wav	4.19	We must get the three points.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_158.wav	5.12	There has been a fair bit in between, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_159.wav	2.78	I feel alive and good today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_160.wav	3.20	We're in England for the time being.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_161.wav	2.43	Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_162.wav	3.03	David Trimble has sold out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_163.wav	3.97	Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_164.wav	3.54	The voters are our masters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_165.wav	4.18	This is great news - a wonderful addition to the programme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_166.wav	3.72	He is willing to pay the required amount.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_167.wav	4.44	These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_168.wav	2.78	He should emerge as the winner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_169.wav	3.37	That's probably the hard bit about being dropped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_170.wav	3.76	We've had an enjoyable adventure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_171.wav	3.72	The story was being repeated across Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_172.wav	3.80	You're not going to forget something like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_173.wav	2.86	They are in the euro.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_174.wav	2.77	The driver was unhurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_175.wav	3.84	Anything that can be done, the Government will do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_176.wav	3.08	It's all about money, money, money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_177.wav	4.10	A bit of match fitness is required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_178.wav	13.01	It was far from business as usual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_179.wav	3.03	There's nothing new in that argument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_180.wav	4.53	Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_181.wav	4.40	The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_182.wav	5.12	That's when you hope to take advantage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_183.wav	3.16	The deadline is real and absolute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_184.wav	3.97	No means testing will be required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_185.wav	4.74	The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_186.wav	3.38	I'm sure it will go on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_187.wav	5.42	He was born in London of Scottish parents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_188.wav	4.78	She is still very poorly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_189.wav	3.08	That's how he did the damage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_190.wav	4.14	He added,  It is all about the search for power.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_191.wav	3.84	I need a publishing deal!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_192.wav	3.80	They tried to give her advice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_193.wav	6.96	If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_194.wav	3.50	Defeat is simply not an option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_195.wav	4.48	We have all been there at some point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_196.wav	5.08	Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_197.wav	3.97	If they don't want to read it, they don't have to.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_198.wav	4.61	At least two women were among those arrested.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_199.wav	4.31	My intentions are to go on like this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_200.wav	6.70	It is not attempting to offer a solution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_201.wav	7.00	She didn't tell me anything the night before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_202.wav	5.96	I will be having talks with the workforce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_203.wav	5.42	It's like an extension of your body.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_204.wav	5.04	That's why he is a national treasure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_205.wav	3.71	It seems a waste of talents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_206.wav	4.02	Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_207.wav	3.33	That is a trend which will be encouraged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_208.wav	4.10	Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_209.wav	3.24	We need to know more about her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_210.wav	3.84	And what is she escaping from?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_211.wav	8.62	Leaving the Labour Party is one thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_212.wav	5.00	The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_213.wav	5.21	He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_214.wav	4.23	What happened in this instance is serious misconduct.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_215.wav	4.66	The distinction is also supported by doctors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_216.wav	5.21	I don't know how they make the weight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_217.wav	4.53	That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_218.wav	4.78	She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_219.wav	3.59	I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_220.wav	3.54	The joint bid is still on course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_221.wav	4.01	This is the best moment of my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_222.wav	3.33	My life has been turned upside down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_224.wav	4.18	Why is he not fighting for the Union?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_225.wav	4.31	Parole is a decision for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_226.wav	4.44	It left me with a sadness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_227.wav	5.34	We don't have any senior players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_228.wav	3.46	Not so, it transpires.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_229.wav	3.93	Knowledge is everything at this level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_230.wav	2.95	This will help our confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_231.wav	2.99	He has a wealth of experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_232.wav	4.23	It is a very beautiful city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_233.wav	3.54	Her body was found on Monday morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_234.wav	5.63	His father and mother are in film production.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_235.wav	3.55	It's about attitudes to change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_236.wav	4.01	I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_237.wav	4.70	We have seen the failure of politics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_238.wav	3.21	The party will make up its own mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_239.wav	3.20	His remarks appear to have had an effect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_240.wav	3.50	I am very sorry to hear about this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_241.wav	4.14	I'm delighted, and the players were brilliant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_242.wav	3.59	Hopefully we can put in a performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_243.wav	3.58	When he came to see me on Monday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_244.wav	3.93	It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_245.wav	3.12	Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_246.wav	3.89	Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_247.wav	4.18	Next league matches, Dundee United - Motherwell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_248.wav	4.40	It became a book by itself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_249.wav	3.16	Here, the fans have been fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_250.wav	3.33	She was close to suicide at one stage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_251.wav	3.29	It is like a theatre of the absurd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_252.wav	3.33	What kind of festival is proposed?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_253.wav	3.80	In my experience, he does not do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_254.wav	4.22	We're all involved in creating the work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_255.wav	3.76	When we started the album.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_256.wav	3.93	We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_257.wav	4.01	Controllers major concern is safety.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_258.wav	2.73	This is your country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_259.wav	3.50	That's the most important thing for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_260.wav	3.25	But it was the sensible thing to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_261.wav	3.55	I think it'll be a great occasion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_262.wav	3.38	The committees are due to report next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_263.wav	2.10	It was seriously unpleasant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_264.wav	3.50	What was the cause of all this outrage?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_265.wav	3.42	Now, she has completed a family tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_266.wav	3.50	The bombing has had a huge influence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_267.wav	2.86	However, the groups denied the claims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_268.wav	3.07	This latter point is hugely important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_269.wav	2.99	The airport was even different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_270.wav	3.84	Whether this return was too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_271.wav	3.58	We're playing away from home and that's it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_272.wav	4.53	It may be down, but New York is not out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_273.wav	4.83	In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_274.wav	5.12	The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_275.wav	3.76	My view has now completely changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_276.wav	4.31	Manchester United are the classic example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_277.wav	2.48	I've never regretted my decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_278.wav	3.72	Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_279.wav	3.71	Glasgow is about to enter a new era.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_280.wav	3.97	Look at the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_281.wav	6.45	Surely it can't get any worse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_282.wav	6.36	He's in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_283.wav	4.40	We still have a long, long way to go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_284.wav	4.31	He preferred to concentrate on the positive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_285.wav	3.67	The Old Firm are going nowhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_286.wav	2.31	I'm not sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_287.wav	3.58	But the championship is not over yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_288.wav	3.76	WE live in a world of large numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_289.wav	3.97	Agents and coaches must be paid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_290.wav	4.70	Charges against the pair were found not proven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_291.wav	3.84	Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_292.wav	4.31	Anyone can still win this tournament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_293.wav	3.93	My husband was angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_294.wav	6.57	You're going to die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_295.wav	4.82	We have to put pressure on Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_296.wav	3.84	We're not really commenting on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_297.wav	4.91	John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_298.wav	3.50	Ferguson is not interested in the finances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_299.wav	3.85	Could they perhaps be related?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_300.wav	3.67	It should be a condition of employment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_301.wav	3.63	It was not being marketed properly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_302.wav	2.86	Sub Not Used, McCormick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_303.wav	3.12	They know their son was murdered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_304.wav	2.05	I love this tournament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_305.wav	2.86	Nobody will be forced to work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_306.wav	3.07	We're all going to take a holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_307.wav	2.99	It is good for Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_308.wav	2.39	This is your chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_309.wav	3.08	They told him to go to drama school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_310.wav	3.80	In order to get there, we have got to invest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_311.wav	4.01	It felt like my support system was leaving.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_312.wav	2.99	The quality of life is difficult for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_313.wav	3.16	I think they are right to be impatient.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_314.wav	3.03	But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_315.wav	3.20	This year it will be Billy Crystal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_316.wav	3.37	The attack was totally out of the blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_317.wav	3.08	It's a member of your family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_318.wav	3.12	It's an hour of the same response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_319.wav	3.20	There's a good chance of seeing something.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_320.wav	3.63	We were in different places, usually in cellars.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_321.wav	2.90	Thirteen people will be made redundant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_322.wav	3.67	This was the performance, and the result they needed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_323.wav	3.72	It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_324.wav	3.16	It will not work in our favour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_325.wav	3.63	We're very close to making it in Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_326.wav	2.65	It was hugely popular decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_327.wav	4.87	The decision was left entirely to him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_328.wav	3.46	They have been contrasting years, certainly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_329.wav	3.76	These findings are vitally important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_330.wav	3.33	That's always the case, isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_331.wav	3.12	I certainly think it should be there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_332.wav	2.61	I'm sure that they will learn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_333.wav	3.12	His commitment, on the other hand, is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_334.wav	0.51	When he got up he was hit again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_335.wav	5.21	If he could have prevented it happening, he would have.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_336.wav	5.25	This time, however, may have been different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_337.wav	3.24	We are well insured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_338.wav	4.36	However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_339.wav	5.93	However, that could alter following the latest case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_340.wav	3.20	It's like a garage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_341.wav	4.48	The last few weeks have been really bad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_342.wav	5.63	I believe in public services.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_343.wav	3.25	The atmosphere is businesslike.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_344.wav	3.42	But you can go beyond that condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_345.wav	3.93	Genetic assessment is crucial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_346.wav	3.50	Tyson said he had made a mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_347.wav	2.35	Four years is a long time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_348.wav	4.35	This process of attrition is expected to continue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_349.wav	2.99	No one wants to go through these things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_350.wav	2.90	You'll get on like a house on fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_351.wav	2.73	All inquiries should be made to the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_352.wav	2.69	Worse still, it can be infectious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_353.wav	4.78	They are a perfectly good thing in principle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_354.wav	3.33	Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_355.wav	2.91	He is very much in our thoughts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_356.wav	2.65	So what could be better than becoming captain?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_357.wav	3.42	Our Great Depression is our lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_358.wav	3.03	He was elected as a councillor last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_359.wav	3.63	You are always aware of the injury potential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_360.wav	3.20	But that is entirely a matter for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_361.wav	3.67	But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_362.wav	3.63	One Minister said the reports were bizarre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_363.wav	3.46	You're not going to get hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_364.wav	2.82	But no decision has been made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_365.wav	3.59	Our traditions and culture remain the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_366.wav	4.02	I decided not to renew the contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_367.wav	3.37	For us, that decision was hard to understand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_368.wav	3.93	Life, as many people know it, in other words.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_369.wav	4.48	There are so many artists working in Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_370.wav	3.25	I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_371.wav	3.25	She makes me feel very proud.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_372.wav	3.50	He had been surprised by the local reaction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_373.wav	2.74	The voices told me to do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_374.wav	2.86	I am a committed European.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_375.wav	3.24	There is no point in looking any further.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_376.wav	3.41	A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_377.wav	3.93	I'm astonished by this decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_378.wav	5.38	General, You didn't get a modified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_379.wav	2.35	Surely the answer is yes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_380.wav	2.65	It's part of your life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_381.wav	3.84	I could go on, but none of these things is true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_382.wav	2.65	That sort of thing is long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_383.wav	3.38	Our proposals are fully costed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_384.wav	3.20	We all started running forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_385.wav	3.46	We did not want an absentee landlord.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_386.wav	2.95	That, however, is only part of the story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_387.wav	3.08	It worked well in Monaco.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_388.wav	2.99	Things were not easy from the outset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_389.wav	3.80	The team is in division one in Spain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_390.wav	4.06	We don't even know his name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_391.wav	5.17	Our position is not a logic of war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_392.wav	4.05	I have played really well all year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_393.wav	3.93	However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_394.wav	4.06	It was visibly on fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_395.wav	3.42	It was a fiery game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_396.wav	3.85	This would give Scotland around eight members.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_397.wav	2.48	That is European law.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_398.wav	3.59	It was very lucky no-one was killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_399.wav	3.67	What has caused the demise of singing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_400.wav	3.33	He's close friend of Gordon Brown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_401.wav	3.54	That is not a position they enjoy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_402.wav	2.90	Blair also had a penalty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_403.wav	3.12	We wanted to run away with her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_404.wav	3.33	Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_405.wav	2.60	I am not retiring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_406.wav	2.73	I didn't want to ignore the punters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_407.wav	3.20	Boy is the town a mess.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_408.wav	2.69	Barry will be able to handle this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_409.wav	3.20	It is a very disturbing picture for men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_410.wav	2.65	To me, it was just a miracle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_411.wav	3.63	After that, though, we are still waiting to see.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_412.wav	2.52	That can happen so easily.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_413.wav	2.69	This is a really serious issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_414.wav	2.48	How do we get more people in?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_415.wav	2.90	Scotland needs to hear it, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_416.wav	3.37	There is too much at stake for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_418.wav	2.86	We suspect he was pleased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_419.wav	2.52	Everything is surrounded by confusion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_420.wav	2.52	But, of course, it isn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_421.wav	4.18	We are almost at that point, but not quite.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_422.wav	3.07	I have to say, for me, the game was not.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_423.wav	3.63	The document is a starting point for discussion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p295\p295_424.wav	3.33	There is still the question of his health.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_001.wav	2.95	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_002.wav	5.04	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_003.wav	9.30	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_004.wav	6.32	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_005.wav	7.85	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_006.wav	8.41	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_007.wav	6.19	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_008.wav	9.47	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_009.wav	6.40	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_010.wav	4.99	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_011.wav	7.90	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say that he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_012.wav	6.45	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_013.wav	6.19	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_014.wav	6.15	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_015.wav	6.27	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_016.wav	7.98	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_017.wav	4.31	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_018.wav	6.58	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_019.wav	8.41	Since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_020.wav	5.34	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_021.wav	10.54	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_023.wav	13.23	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_024.wav	8.11	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_025.wav	4.65	But it's been kept to a minimum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_026.wav	4.82	We have gone on about him no end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_027.wav	5.17	And the art of performance is taking risks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_028.wav	4.83	Appointments should be made on merit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_029.wav	3.59	I feel strongly about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_030.wav	3.76	Tommy is not a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_031.wav	5.12	I started on fire a couple of times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_032.wav	5.34	Jack McConnell will be making a statement tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_033.wav	4.06	Other forces were, however, at work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_034.wav	6.02	The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_035.wav	4.70	The defender should have won the bloody ba.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_036.wav	5.76	In the meantime, everyone is taking everyone to court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_037.wav	3.84	My fitness was very poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_038.wav	3.46	You have caught a serial killer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_039.wav	4.44	Her mother said, She didn't look very well at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_040.wav	3.33	I am writing a novel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_041.wav	4.48	Fewer people are being killed in accidents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_042.wav	4.57	Sure the COE is a cracking band.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_043.wav	4.57	He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_044.wav	3.84	Bombing is the easy option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_045.wav	5.08	On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_046.wav	4.01	Except for this, it was offside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_047.wav	5.34	After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_048.wav	3.72	What do we do for an encore?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_049.wav	4.91	Things start to talk to each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_050.wav	4.61	At the time, he was a living legend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_051.wav	5.85	I would like to stay with Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_052.wav	4.83	All will be revealed in due course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_053.wav	3.24	It was located on the remote control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_054.wav	3.88	January is a bad time of year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_055.wav	4.40	HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_056.wav	5.21	That is an important part of our role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_057.wav	4.19	From our point of view, it's the right time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_058.wav	3.89	You just have to accept.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_059.wav	3.58	People will see this over time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_060.wav	4.14	The tribunal continues today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_061.wav	4.82	Basically, the classical tradition won out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_062.wav	5.29	It obviously changes the prospects for getting agreement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_063.wav	3.76	Nobody can get at them there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_065.wav	4.57	It's not only my respect for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_066.wav	4.01	The police have an awful lot to explain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_067.wav	3.84	BIG Brother is listening to you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_068.wav	5.13	We will be paying agency rates.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_069.wav	4.48	This is a very high price.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_070.wav	4.57	In the end, however, it all came together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_071.wav	3.76	They can be time consuming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_072.wav	4.91	It's a depressing, difficult and demanding job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_074.wav	3.42	Subtle it is not.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_075.wav	6.83	If they don't, they can expect their funding to be cut.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_076.wav	3.93	I had a tie in my hand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_077.wav	3.50	Raised the way you want it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_078.wav	5.21	Football is very easy, you have to work for the team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_079.wav	3.38	Then he did it twice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_080.wav	3.33	We were short of athletes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_081.wav	3.93	You have to do your research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_082.wav	5.47	Things were so intense in the studio.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_083.wav	5.04	Its first awards will do just that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_084.wav	5.76	It was the crowning point of my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_085.wav	3.38	You could feel the heat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_086.wav	3.33	She is still very poorly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_087.wav	4.18	That's how she wants to remember him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_088.wav	5.12	Do something that you haven't done before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_090.wav	6.06	We talk about effective military action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_091.wav	4.82	Craig is a major concern for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_092.wav	4.70	The scientific debate is dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_093.wav	3.76	I sincerely hope not.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_094.wav	3.76	Broomfield was the centre of the town.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_095.wav	3.29	There is no such thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_096.wav	5.16	However, their reaction could not have been more different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_097.wav	4.61	I was doing well at the hustings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_098.wav	3.85	My wife and family are the support system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_099.wav	3.67	The scheme is hopelessly failing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_100.wav	3.46	The body follows the mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_101.wav	2.69	That gives it a spirit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_102.wav	4.44	It isn't just a defining issue for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_103.wav	3.54	However, what is his calibre?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_104.wav	4.69	If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_105.wav	3.50	Sub Not Used, McArthur.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_106.wav	3.80	And if he hadn't become a musician?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_107.wav	4.14	No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_108.wav	2.73	She died in middle age.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_109.wav	3.59	You need insurance to bring people in.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_110.wav	3.93	A great deal has been achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_111.wav	3.25	What was it like playing real people?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_112.wav	3.50	We are just being flooded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_113.wav	3.76	This ruling is unfair to everyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_114.wav	3.97	It is, honestly, difficult to write about this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_115.wav	4.74	That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_116.wav	3.76	Obviously, Airbus is one of these.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_117.wav	4.06	The singer's condition was not specified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_118.wav	3.76	It's too big a risk to take.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_119.wav	3.42	It's an expensive part of their equipment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_120.wav	3.72	Our lives have been turned upside down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_121.wav	3.50	The General Election is all to play for.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_122.wav	4.27	I saw the other car coming, but could do nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_123.wav	4.14	Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_124.wav	5.34	United were in control without always being dominant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_125.wav	4.53	Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_126.wav	5.17	Which brings us to the question of money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_127.wav	5.25	Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_128.wav	4.44	It was my shortest audition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_129.wav	4.10	This would give Scotland around eight members.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_130.wav	3.33	It's unsafe for society.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_131.wav	3.24	Three penalties were given.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_132.wav	4.40	But that's not the idea behind this article.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_133.wav	4.57	Come to that, is any of this really happening?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_134.wav	4.23	What did they think of her voice?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_135.wav	4.65	Worse still, he might be singing Lady in Red.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_136.wav	4.35	We were extremely poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_137.wav	4.23	He needed a kidney - it's as simple as that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_138.wav	4.18	It was better than a soap opera.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_139.wav	2.57	It's not a great art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_140.wav	4.10	She took them for a term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_141.wav	3.72	It is easy to agree with him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_142.wav	4.14	Nato was not a love affair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_143.wav	3.25	We believe that the reason is poverty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_144.wav	2.14	It's my nature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_145.wav	3.07	He was shocked by what he saw.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_146.wav	4.74	Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_147.wav	4.36	We had a really good experience with David.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_148.wav	4.57	Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_149.wav	3.20	Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_150.wav	3.08	It is the wealthiest in Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_151.wav	3.71	Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_152.wav	4.05	I will go out with him any time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_153.wav	3.93	That's my big challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_154.wav	4.53	The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_155.wav	5.17	They said we were out of touch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_156.wav	4.02	My son was too young to die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_157.wav	4.10	Fatherhood is important to Tony Blair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_158.wav	4.70	The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_159.wav	4.35	The captaincy will help that, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_160.wav	4.78	Tax is a matter for national governments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_161.wav	4.05	If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_162.wav	4.48	He admitted that he knew nothing about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_163.wav	3.38	We meet again in Berlin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_164.wav	3.33	It's always the same, isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_165.wav	3.25	Don't get me wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_166.wav	3.41	He died from multiple injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_167.wav	2.78	They would never let him go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_168.wav	4.40	That could be in place by next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_169.wav	2.48	I'm going to buy a car.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_170.wav	2.90	Which is worse?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_171.wav	4.74	The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_172.wav	2.99	I'm not talking about his career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_173.wav	4.05	Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_174.wav	3.16	But what lies ahead?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_175.wav	3.89	There will be tough opponents to this report.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_176.wav	3.29	It was like the old days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_177.wav	3.08	I couldn't honestly tell you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_178.wav	4.18	The whole thing has been a fantastic experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_179.wav	3.63	The first time you read a play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_180.wav	4.14	We are committed to urgent action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_181.wav	3.20	I wish him well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_182.wav	3.50	Others may be trying to catch up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_183.wav	3.20	I read it every year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_184.wav	3.67	I think we've got the balance right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_185.wav	2.86	There is no guarantee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_186.wav	3.63	Some may end up in hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_187.wav	2.86	I'll tell you honestly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_188.wav	4.27	I let go the telephone and ran.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_189.wav	5.12	News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_190.wav	4.95	There's not much money in cycling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_191.wav	3.08	Public safety is paramount.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_192.wav	2.78	We've never seen so many.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_193.wav	4.27	After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_194.wav	3.63	I'm sure you all can relate to that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_195.wav	3.46	Scots actors should be so lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_196.wav	3.08	I was just doing my job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_197.wav	2.82	Blood samples were taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_198.wav	3.55	We're trying to get rounded performers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_199.wav	3.93	Any error is severely punished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_200.wav	4.65	They tend to be female and retired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_201.wav	3.29	I think it will make a huge difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_202.wav	3.54	We have a high quality product.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_203.wav	3.76	The home team also had their moments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_204.wav	3.84	I have played well the past two days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_205.wav	4.10	He has not created a Festival resource.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_206.wav	4.40	From day one, we were a family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_207.wav	4.14	Fishermen are still in a state of confusion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_208.wav	4.02	Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_209.wav	3.46	It's a metaphor for consumption.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_210.wav	3.16	He's an excellent defender, strong and quick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_211.wav	3.54	That's hard for a woman.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_212.wav	4.57	THE atmosphere was electric.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_213.wav	2.95	The boys are very confident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_215.wav	3.08	This club have been fair to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_216.wav	4.36	Secondly, there are other options for patients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_217.wav	3.46	Access has been a nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_218.wav	4.36	What does she consider her greatest achievement?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_219.wav	4.40	I'm looking at ways to do that now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_220.wav	4.78	The first is in Whitehall, the second in Brussels.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_221.wav	6.58	And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_222.wav	3.88	There has been no reaction from them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_223.wav	2.99	She failed in her action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_224.wav	4.40	The record companies have gone through the floor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_225.wav	3.80	It was more like a Labour Party rally.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_226.wav	4.05	The group will report back in the summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_227.wav	2.78	She looked so young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_228.wav	3.29	I will let you in on a secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_229.wav	3.93	Don't you think it was a fine performance?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_230.wav	4.74	They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_231.wav	3.50	Well, they were the unlucky ones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_232.wav	4.27	She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_233.wav	3.07	We need a visionary producer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_234.wav	3.20	I enjoyed my work in the Scottish Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_235.wav	2.95	Some were close to tears.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_236.wav	3.41	I saw it at a ruck.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_237.wav	3.42	I have great confidence in Annabelle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_238.wav	3.07	He's a sort of mystery figure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_239.wav	4.78	Europe is not a threat to Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_240.wav	4.99	He just wants to leave a legacy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_241.wav	3.33	Every game against New Zealand is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_242.wav	2.95	Dialogue is the key.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_243.wav	3.33	But they didn't much like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_244.wav	3.33	We just wish they had done so before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_245.wav	3.25	I am sorry to hear this news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_246.wav	3.97	However we're capable of beating them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_247.wav	4.06	They chose the latter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_248.wav	3.76	I've not said anything to them, they know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_249.wav	2.69	It's like a high school play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_250.wav	2.99	That is how it will be judged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_251.wav	4.14	It's there for people to look at.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_254.wav	2.99	Who did the recruiting?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_255.wav	3.76	Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_256.wav	3.97	However, we had no failures in our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_257.wav	2.35	This is his first movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_258.wav	2.73	The farmers had no choice in the matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_259.wav	2.69	They were assured that it would.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_260.wav	2.73	I'm the one who has to suffer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_261.wav	2.73	She was charged with perjury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_262.wav	3.41	With us, we just want them to respond.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_263.wav	3.71	But something has been lost in the translation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_264.wav	3.20	That's the last thing they need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_265.wav	2.31	I made a big mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_266.wav	3.97	England against France is always a big game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_267.wav	3.54	When he came to see me on Monday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_268.wav	3.93	Government must recognise the problems of Aberdeen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_269.wav	2.82	The criteria have changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_270.wav	2.86	A new school will be built.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_271.wav	3.12	Who reminded him about the score?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_272.wav	4.40	And it had been a marvellous occasion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_273.wav	3.37	I will not walk away from this job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_274.wav	3.37	Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_275.wav	2.91	How do you find the youngsters?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_276.wav	3.33	They are declining elsewhere in the UK.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_277.wav	3.63	It does not move, which is amazing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_278.wav	3.67	We've always had a very positive attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_279.wav	2.90	Part of England, is not?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_280.wav	2.48	It may have been a cry for help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_281.wav	3.67	There were no passengers on board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_282.wav	4.35	Mr Forrester reacted angrily.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_283.wav	2.99	This is wrong, but that's believed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_284.wav	6.28	They were not up to the required standard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_285.wav	5.12	Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_286.wav	3.89	The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_287.wav	4.23	Its people are inventive, talented and diligent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_288.wav	3.50	We want to replicate that success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_289.wav	2.65	I couldn't put my finger on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_290.wav	3.50	Taxation should be simplified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_291.wav	3.03	That's a trend which will be encouraged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_292.wav	3.88	He looked at me before replying.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_293.wav	3.42	But today was the real big one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_294.wav	6.49	Someone else can do the cooking that night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_295.wav	3.33	That idea is rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_296.wav	3.16	Actually, it turned out to be the concerto.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_297.wav	4.10	He planned to relocate to Scotland, probably Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_298.wav	3.54	After that, we made some changes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_299.wav	3.54	It has not yet opened to pupils.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_300.wav	3.84	However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_301.wav	3.24	Almost overnight, he found his voice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_302.wav	3.72	I want my audience to be challenged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_303.wav	3.03	It was quite a new prescription.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_304.wav	3.21	That, too, was over two years ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_305.wav	2.18	Who do you think you are?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_306.wav	2.65	Glasgow is a tour de force.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_307.wav	4.19	I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_308.wav	3.29	I can understand why they have gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_309.wav	3.03	They will give it a couple of years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_310.wav	2.82	Your father was a good man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_311.wav	2.69	Bob Dylan's getting old.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_312.wav	2.99	Our number one goal is prevention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_313.wav	4.14	Mr Mason is claiming unfair dismissal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_314.wav	2.73	And he is immensely loyal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_315.wav	3.24	The actor has met with Mandela.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_316.wav	2.61	But there was no time for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_317.wav	2.82	He confirmed that there had been no warning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_318.wav	3.55	I am not against a further inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_319.wav	3.88	The company's in good shape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_320.wav	4.14	There are different cultures in different departments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_321.wav	3.25	He was caught and fired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_322.wav	2.74	I was pregnant and very worried.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_323.wav	3.80	Davis is very supportive, as a director.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_324.wav	3.80	I'll never have problems with any football managers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_325.wav	4.91	It's only tackling congestion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_326.wav	3.03	I came into this world with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_327.wav	3.93	You will never replace the child.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_328.wav	5.29	I'm delighted at Murray's appointment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_329.wav	2.99	Off with their heads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_330.wav	2.95	There will have to be a full inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_331.wav	4.14	They are now out in the cold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_332.wav	3.12	The way ahead is not easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_333.wav	3.12	He intends to appeal the sentences.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_334.wav	2.65	There is no smoking gun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_335.wav	3.59	His primary residence is Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_336.wav	3.03	It's an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_337.wav	3.16	You are going to take away my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_338.wav	3.16	That was one very hard game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_339.wav	3.84	Officers recovered a second body in the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_340.wav	4.01	This is the start of a slippery slope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_341.wav	3.25	I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_342.wav	2.13	Don't hold your breath.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_343.wav	2.61	The girls are ready to compete.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_344.wav	2.69	O, Is there anything in the wound?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_345.wav	3.12	Mini rugby is a great thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_346.wav	3.07	It was blown out of proportion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_347.wav	3.03	We certainly hope we have been successful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_348.wav	3.03	Surely it can do better than that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_349.wav	3.37	It was all too little, too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_350.wav	3.80	Substantial pockets of resistance remain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_351.wav	3.50	Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_352.wav	3.54	It is only one night, after all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_353.wav	3.16	The professor said the results were positive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_354.wav	2.43	Gilbert was not amused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_355.wav	4.40	This should include procedures for personal imports.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_356.wav	3.20	The course record was in his name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_357.wav	3.24	With him are the symbols of his faith.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_358.wav	4.02	He said he had no reports of casualties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_359.wav	2.39	It's easy to see why.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_360.wav	3.50	The board is currently resolving its differences.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_361.wav	3.25	There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_362.wav	3.29	He had lost his confidence again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_363.wav	3.08	So, where do we go from here?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_364.wav	2.90	I was never alone with her, right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_365.wav	3.67	This kind of traffic is commonplace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_366.wav	2.67	I think we'll just keep it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_367.wav	3.50	How is he enjoying life as a senior?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_368.wav	5.04	It has proved a double whammy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_369.wav	3.80	We make good weapons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_370.wav	3.93	The vacancies are in support services and arts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_371.wav	3.03	What has changed?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_372.wav	3.76	Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_373.wav	3.50	It's like English in its underwear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_374.wav	3.80	I've been thinking about it for a year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_375.wav	3.42	This is the same old story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_376.wav	4.74	Above all the aggression must be stopped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_377.wav	3.97	All of us in Scotland should be vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_378.wav	3.42	They finished second and third.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_379.wav	3.63	Everyone has his share of trouble.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_380.wav	3.07	You need a licence to run a pub.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_381.wav	3.50	He loved his job and working in newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_382.wav	4.14	I don't want a burial service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_383.wav	3.16	And it's time for new leadership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_384.wav	2.05	I'm not sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_385.wav	3.50	One might think that is a power.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_386.wav	6.02	We've been calling for a level playing field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_387.wav	4.61	Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_388.wav	2.56	We have big ideas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_389.wav	3.20	I hope the voters will respond.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_390.wav	3.46	And who would argue with that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_391.wav	2.91	I believe that gap is nearly there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_392.wav	3.33	This is the real thing now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_393.wav	4.14	There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_394.wav	3.33	I ran to get out of the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_395.wav	3.16	It was to be published next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_396.wav	2.95	It's not a party, no, no.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_397.wav	3.41	We have understood the problems for some time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_398.wav	4.14	Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_399.wav	4.10	The work with Alison was a great experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_400.wav	3.03	She now lives in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_401.wav	3.24	But every country has its own character.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_402.wav	2.99	I don't have a problem with getting older.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_403.wav	3.67	In addition, it was just a breach of natural justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_404.wav	5.38	I played really well on the back nine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_405.wav	4.02	Last week, he was taken into hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_406.wav	3.59	I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_407.wav	3.07	One policeman was killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_408.wav	3.97	Everything is now in place for Manchester.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_409.wav	2.82	My heart is not so sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_410.wav	3.80	You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_411.wav	3.37	You have to rely on each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_412.wav	3.07	However, it was well worth the wait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_413.wav	3.50	It is a thing of beauty to watch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_414.wav	4.22	However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_415.wav	3.46	It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_416.wav	4.27	However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_417.wav	2.35	This is his personal life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_418.wav	2.99	Now he is trying to downgrade the media.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_419.wav	3.50	Hollywood comedy is having a good week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_420.wav	3.37	Yet the consensus is, it's worth it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_421.wav	1.71	It'`	s the tip of the iceberg.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_422.wav	3.03	It's a true story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_423.wav	3.20	There was a substantial explosion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p297\p297_424.wav	5.63	John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_001.wav	2.86	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_002.wav	4.36	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_003.wav	7.34	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_004.wav	4.91	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_005.wav	5.98	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_006.wav	6.83	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_007.wav	4.74	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_008.wav	7.17	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_009.wav	4.91	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_010.wav	3.59	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_011.wav	7.04	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_012.wav	4.78	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_013.wav	4.78	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_014.wav	5.00	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_015.wav	6.66	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_016.wav	6.83	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_017.wav	3.93	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_018.wav	7.81	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_019.wav	7.25	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_020.wav	4.74	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_021.wav	9.73	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_022.wav	7.20	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_023.wav	10.40	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_024.wav	7.98	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_025.wav	3.46	It is bad news for the flooded areas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_026.wav	4.35	There will be widespread support on all sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_027.wav	4.36	This was the classical period of Beethoven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_028.wav	3.46	That is just a load of baloney.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_029.wav	3.50	I was never going to play against Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_030.wav	3.76	Any error of judgment was ruled out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_031.wav	5.12	For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_032.wav	3.03	The feeling is marvellous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_033.wav	3.50	I think they should have more respect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_034.wav	4.53	The crackdown is launched today by the government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_035.wav	4.10	They are interior designers and architects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_036.wav	3.93	Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_037.wav	3.25	Others may be trying to catch up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_038.wav	3.42	It was a crucial moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_039.wav	3.46	We gave everything we had.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_040.wav	4.05	I let go the telephone and ran.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_041.wav	3.93	For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_042.wav	3.76	His charisma is all on the course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_043.wav	3.33	This is purely financial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_044.wav	4.18	I will not be in dialogue with her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_045.wav	4.57	Our dispute is with the company, not with the travelling public.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_046.wav	3.54	I did not want any damage to us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_047.wav	4.99	It was an easy decision to come here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_048.wav	5.42	I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_049.wav	3.59	However, you have just got to adjust to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_050.wav	4.01	I saw them not long after it happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_051.wav	3.46	This guy is never going to give up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_052.wav	4.18	Who said impatience is a virtue?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_053.wav	5.55	Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_054.wav	4.27	You've got to have everything inside with you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_055.wav	4.70	But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_056.wav	3.84	Several hundred people attended yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_057.wav	3.97	It was more like a Labour Party rally.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_058.wav	4.78	In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_059.wav	4.14	The partnership was set up during the summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_060.wav	4.48	Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_061.wav	5.85	The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_062.wav	3.46	Don't say you have not been warned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_063.wav	4.19	That is a mark of what you are.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_064.wav	3.89	Seven children had lost both parents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_065.wav	4.19	It is par for the course, isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_066.wav	3.89	Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_067.wav	3.55	Most people know that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_068.wav	3.93	Some people still think she should be English.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_069.wav	3.72	Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_070.wav	3.84	Repayment is not part of the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_071.wav	4.52	The cause of the crash was unclear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_072.wav	3.20	What do they pay to join the club?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_073.wav	3.84	Two people are allowed to share the duty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_074.wav	3.25	We are now in a safe place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_075.wav	3.50	She goes to the opening of an envelope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_076.wav	3.97	It will be very useful for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_077.wav	3.54	He was obviously very genuine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_078.wav	4.14	We just try to make great records.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_079.wav	4.06	She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_080.wav	3.29	I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_081.wav	4.01	It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_082.wav	3.29	Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_083.wav	3.88	His parenthood is called into question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_084.wav	4.27	Audacious decisions were taken early on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_085.wav	4.36	We really need research to help with that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_086.wav	5.76	In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_087.wav	4.01	There were no passengers on board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_088.wav	5.51	At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_089.wav	5.17	It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_090.wav	4.91	Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_091.wav	5.59	There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_092.wav	5.04	These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_093.wav	4.06	He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_094.wav	4.06	Scotland were beaten again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_095.wav	4.74	The Premier League has been a huge success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_096.wav	4.61	The League of Nations was also his idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_097.wav	3.33	I've done it almost like a variety show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_098.wav	3.97	She is on a life support machine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_099.wav	3.76	Their vision was not impeded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_100.wav	5.25	Sooner rather than later, though, the healing must begin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_101.wav	4.61	The election is total confusion and chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_102.wav	4.78	Next league matches, Dundee United - Kilmarnock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_103.wav	3.80	He went to see what he could learn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_104.wav	5.42	It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_105.wav	4.36	Referees are easy targets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_106.wav	5.34	The luxury has been well used.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_107.wav	4.65	Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_108.wav	5.34	Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_109.wav	4.48	We think all other measures are not exhausted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_110.wav	3.16	There was no time scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_111.wav	3.50	Only the scale of change differed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_112.wav	3.12	Tell you the team he picked?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_113.wav	4.31	Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_114.wav	3.71	The cold war is over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_115.wav	4.01	I'd like to take the plunge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_116.wav	4.35	Lately, that market has come under pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_117.wav	3.42	And it's more subversive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_118.wav	3.03	We are losing this war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_119.wav	4.91	Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_120.wav	4.31	After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_121.wav	3.33	They will know they deserve to be there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_122.wav	3.03	I've got no secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_123.wav	4.06	In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_124.wav	4.78	John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_125.wav	4.23	I asked why he had come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_126.wav	4.40	Will they ever reopen?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_127.wav	4.74	After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_128.wav	3.03	A lot of people were in tears.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_129.wav	4.06	We have great team spirit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_130.wav	3.67	Above all the aggression must be stopped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_131.wav	5.42	He loves the big occasions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_132.wav	4.14	They should take their mobile phones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_133.wav	3.29	He loved his job and working in newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_134.wav	2.65	We have big ideas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_135.wav	3.54	I first met him last summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_136.wav	4.06	It was to be published next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_137.wav	4.87	Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_138.wav	4.86	It could have been a hammering by now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_139.wav	5.76	Subs not used, Fernandez.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_140.wav	3.50	I played really well on the back nine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_141.wav	3.25	It's a bit like a bereavement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_142.wav	3.93	It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_143.wav	4.48	Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_144.wav	4.57	That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_145.wav	6.10	But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_146.wav	4.33	What was going through her mind that day, that night?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_147.wav	3.50	I always knew she was funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_148.wav	5.81	All kinds of things occur.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_149.wav	3.46	I expected these kind of questions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_150.wav	3.59	It was fit for royalty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_151.wav	3.16	It is always the same, isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_152.wav	4.01	Who would take it now, after all this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_153.wav	3.54	I felt really good until Friday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_154.wav	4.99	That gives us something to kick against.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_155.wav	6.19	Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_156.wav	4.61	Equity declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_157.wav	4.18	There is precious little middle ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_158.wav	5.08	She was shouting my baby, my baby.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_159.wav	4.01	The inquiry had been going on for months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_160.wav	3.85	They were both delightful to work with.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_161.wav	3.46	It's my delight on a shiny night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_162.wav	4.44	I'd go anywhere to work, so long as it's worth it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_163.wav	4.23	It's now down in black and white.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_164.wav	3.25	Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_165.wav	3.29	It is quite an eye opener.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_166.wav	4.05	Hillary plans to meet him on the summit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_167.wav	5.17	What, they maybe have three Scottish players?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_168.wav	3.89	Can they be serious?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_169.wav	5.34	For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_170.wav	4.53	That, in our view, is an important decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_171.wav	4.14	It's just that we see different things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_172.wav	4.18	Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_173.wav	3.93	We are all family men with children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_174.wav	4.23	I think we showed that after half time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_175.wav	4.83	Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_176.wav	4.22	A wide range of restrictions are in place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_177.wav	3.80	There was pressure from elsewhere too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_178.wav	3.67	You let a lot of people down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_179.wav	3.59	One person was believed to have been hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_180.wav	5.85	Mistakes are being made on an increasing basis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_181.wav	2.69	We aren't going to play better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_182.wav	3.20	They just would not have run away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_183.wav	3.67	Two men have been charged with his murder.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_184.wav	6.44	Lifeboat is at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow, tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_185.wav	3.88	The guys have really enjoyed it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_186.wav	3.16	Charles Clarke is an idiot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_187.wav	3.88	Our people should be immune.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_188.wav	3.76	Glasgow then took control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_189.wav	3.76	It is simple and easy to use.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_190.wav	5.12	English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_191.wav	5.72	The rear of the plane was on fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_192.wav	4.14	I think we finished fifth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_193.wav	3.55	It was not a foul.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_194.wav	4.18	We know them as mobile telephones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_195.wav	4.95	Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_196.wav	3.76	I don't know exactly what happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_197.wav	5.59	They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_198.wav	3.76	The Government faces a moral dilemma.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_199.wav	3.80	The pressure is on President Bush to deliver.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_200.wav	4.78	But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_201.wav	3.88	It was a very difficult decision for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_202.wav	2.86	I am not a happy man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_203.wav	3.71	You can be sure we will have problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_204.wav	3.93	Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_205.wav	3.33	I'm going with all three.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_206.wav	3.93	Most of them were one-year conscripts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_207.wav	3.67	The line-up is a tasty one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_208.wav	4.23	I don't honestly know how to describe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_209.wav	5.72	He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_210.wav	3.29	He had taken everything from me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_211.wav	4.40	Many, many people don't know who he is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_212.wav	3.89	Suspension will come into force at midnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_213.wav	3.58	They should also have the right to vote.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_214.wav	3.67	All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_215.wav	5.76	WHAT's in a name is this, the age of the Internet?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_216.wav	5.42	People are so negative about the whole business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_217.wav	3.08	They had given up on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_218.wav	3.33	We didn't know if people would turn up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_219.wav	3.54	It has made me feel good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_220.wav	4.91	You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_221.wav	5.59	We have our supporters and our enemies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_222.wav	4.10	She has now been registered as disabled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_223.wav	4.40	Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_224.wav	2.82	I was living with my mum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_225.wav	4.65	It did my image a lot of good!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_226.wav	4.14	This Government believes in parental discipline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_227.wav	5.42	It's been a long, long journey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_228.wav	3.59	That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_229.wav	4.19	But there has never been the time, she said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_230.wav	3.93	This could be one such case, he declared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_231.wav	2.61	I fell in love with ballet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_232.wav	3.25	The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_233.wav	5.76	Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_234.wav	4.52	Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_235.wav	4.10	I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_236.wav	3.59	We're still talking with a few people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_237.wav	5.04	But one shouldn't go by that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_238.wav	5.42	Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_239.wav	2.39	I think in three dimensions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_240.wav	5.51	They had four children together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_241.wav	3.63	Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_242.wav	4.87	Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_243.wav	3.67	How can they engage with the work?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_244.wav	3.20	All were later allowed home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_245.wav	3.29	She has a wonderful mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_246.wav	2.82	There are just two tournaments remaining.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_247.wav	4.82	We're into that build-up now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_248.wav	2.43	It is the end of an era.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_249.wav	3.97	We can just get on with our game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_250.wav	2.73	But first it goes out on TV.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_251.wav	5.33	We're trying to lessen the stigma.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_252.wav	2.95	Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_253.wav	4.87	Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_254.wav	4.22	I learned a lot from her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_255.wav	13.40	We have reacted well to each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_256.wav	4.61	Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_257.wav	3.97	They seem to be backing off from that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_258.wav	4.31	They have a very good method of working.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_259.wav	2.39	Do you think you have a shot?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_260.wav	2.95	I believe we have a good chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_261.wav	3.33	Things were not easy from the outset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_262.wav	3.50	She may even appear in some more films.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_263.wav	6.27	We've had great things in the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_264.wav	4.10	Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_265.wav	4.14	I've seen some of the submissions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_266.wav	3.84	There is no such thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_267.wav	2.69	I feel very strongly about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_268.wav	3.97	It is a difficult thing to explain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_269.wav	3.33	After that nothing could save him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_270.wav	5.25	His treatment has been quite atrocious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_271.wav	5.17	It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_272.wav	4.18	Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_273.wav	3.84	It is now very clear that doesn't work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_274.wav	3.37	My dad was working in Ayrshire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_275.wav	4.74	There are lots of these women in Finland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_276.wav	3.59	Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_277.wav	3.76	Last year, however, was a different story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_278.wav	3.67	He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_279.wav	2.91	I bought a car at auction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_280.wav	4.31	And who were they anyway, beforehand?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_281.wav	3.85	What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_282.wav	3.29	She had been sexually assaulted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_283.wav	4.48	Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_284.wav	3.80	Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_285.wav	4.35	They are so easy for youngsters to open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_286.wav	4.06	We have been treated with complete contempt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_287.wav	4.06	There is no smoking gun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_288.wav	3.76	It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_289.wav	4.78	Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_290.wav	4.74	If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_291.wav	4.10	The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_292.wav	3.42	I have been coming here for nine years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_293.wav	3.46	I felt under no pressure today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_294.wav	3.50	The Devil is the creator of weapons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_295.wav	3.29	And that was the adults.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_296.wav	4.99	Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_297.wav	3.03	That is a job for the Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_298.wav	3.67	I felt the head was very like me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_299.wav	3.03	And he had much need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_300.wav	3.46	Last night the bombardment was terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_301.wav	3.03	This can only help us go forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_302.wav	3.29	That left a bad taste in my mouth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_303.wav	4.06	But, even so, you always want to try something new.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_304.wav	3.16	Andrew McLellan is no exception.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_305.wav	3.97	His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_306.wav	4.53	Some have other commitments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_307.wav	4.49	Last week, he was taken into hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_308.wav	4.57	He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_309.wav	5.17	No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_310.wav	2.56	The crowd was awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_311.wav	2.90	That was moving the goalposts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_312.wav	3.84	We have the location, which is assured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_313.wav	2.78	Rapid revision was required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_314.wav	4.91	What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_315.wav	4.01	We couldn't go very fast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_316.wav	3.41	Tony Blair, can you see her face?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_317.wav	4.10	Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_318.wav	2.90	We have grown up in Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_319.wav	5.12	They had previously been on five-day notice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_320.wav	5.38	I am proud of those guys.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_321.wav	5.59	It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_322.wav	3.80	It is too early to speculate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_323.wav	5.76	She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_324.wav	3.46	I'll go out and be aggressive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_325.wav	4.61	I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_326.wav	3.63	What is the truth about the cow?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_327.wav	4.14	They will want to watch a winning team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_328.wav	6.10	Who is going to be penalised?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_329.wav	4.57	I feel sorry for the Reds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_330.wav	4.61	The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_331.wav	3.38	Just see where the blood is coming from.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_332.wav	4.31	I have a theory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_333.wav	6.49	In her opinion, the rich are different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_334.wav	5.72	Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_335.wav	4.69	Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_336.wav	4.05	Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_337.wav	3.84	Sentence was deferred for background reports.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_338.wav	6.15	I'm very sad and deeply shocked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_339.wav	5.34	Some of his family still live there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_340.wav	4.58	However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_341.wav	3.93	Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_342.wav	4.22	I get to work with very good people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_343.wav	3.76	A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_344.wav	4.48	Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_345.wav	5.89	And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_346.wav	7.51	I can't blame the fans for getting frustrated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_347.wav	4.82	On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_348.wav	5.30	I can appear to be nice and lovely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_349.wav	3.71	I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_350.wav	6.62	People tended to stay there for some time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_351.wav	4.61	An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_352.wav	4.61	My preference is for the single vaccines.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_353.wav	3.59	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_354.wav	2.90	He saw it all as a big game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_355.wav	3.29	The boy is no longer with us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_356.wav	4.48	Staff should be paid for what they produce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_357.wav	4.53	I would urge the Government to think again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_358.wav	3.88	They were on holiday in Egypt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_359.wav	4.74	I was happiest with my short game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_360.wav	4.99	We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_361.wav	6.15	I'm delighted with how he has come through.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_362.wav	3.89	As if he were a High Court judge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_363.wav	3.67	Would he be able to live with that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_364.wav	2.95	I'm looking at ways to do that now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_365.wav	3.72	That kind of growth is the important thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_366.wav	6.92	The problems are a result of that shortfall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_367.wav	2.48	And a film maker was born.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_368.wav	6.02	It was also put on the Internet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_369.wav	5.34	He also has a Scottish grandfather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_370.wav	3.93	Now that was a boxing movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_371.wav	4.65	Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_372.wav	3.93	There was a battle there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_373.wav	3.46	I might also completely change the routine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_374.wav	3.72	Today's ruling confirms that fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_375.wav	3.84	It's good news and long overdue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_376.wav	4.40	Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_377.wav	2.99	I have learned a lot from him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_378.wav	3.37	He has been campaigning for change for years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_379.wav	2.65	I have beaten her a few times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_380.wav	3.76	They have their own audience in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_381.wav	5.42	So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_382.wav	3.46	We are being hijacked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_383.wav	3.37	Mike Tyson went to prison.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_384.wav	3.97	She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_385.wav	4.19	This is the first stage of catching up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_386.wav	3.33	This is a long-term discussion paper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_387.wav	4.01	In all cases computer equipment was seized.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_388.wav	3.54	The damage from the fire was huge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_389.wav	4.48	Both agreed on the success of the event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_390.wav	4.01	But we'll just keep trying to get results.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_391.wav	3.42	What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_392.wav	3.20	We have to offer value for money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_393.wav	5.38	There will always be someone, somewhere, willing to undercut on price.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_394.wav	5.59	However, in October another partnership was announced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_395.wav	3.55	I am just looking to God.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_396.wav	4.05	The woman is basically off her head.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_397.wav	3.54	The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_398.wav	6.32	Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_399.wav	4.10	Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_400.wav	4.40	The South African defended his work ethic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_401.wav	3.89	The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_402.wav	3.93	You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_403.wav	3.93	The new work will begin in the autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_404.wav	3.76	The written judgment was issued in printed form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p298\p298_405.wav	3.46	He showed he has some things to learn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_001.wav	2.56	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_002.wav	4.01	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_003.wav	7.60	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_004.wav	5.29	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_005.wav	6.40	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_006.wav	5.68	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_007.wav	4.74	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_008.wav	8.07	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_009.wav	5.08	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_010.wav	3.25	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_011.wav	7.34	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_012.wav	5.50	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_013.wav	4.91	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_014.wav	5.16	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_015.wav	6.40	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_016.wav	6.87	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_017.wav	4.19	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_018.wav	5.85	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_019.wav	7.43	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_020.wav	4.36	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_021.wav	8.75	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_022.wav	7.38	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_023.wav	10.75	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_024.wav	7.64	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_025.wav	3.29	I just went for it over the weekend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_026.wav	3.76	I managed to take her completely by surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_027.wav	3.67	It is only one night, after all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_028.wav	3.12	Gilbert was not amused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_029.wav	3.72	My first season in Scotland was fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_030.wav	4.14	I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_031.wav	2.99	It has moved on in the last week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_032.wav	2.52	It's easy to see why.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_033.wav	2.90	I am proud of moments like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_034.wav	3.63	This is a totally different order of agreement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_035.wav	3.41	Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_036.wav	3.84	He was arrested, but later released without charge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_037.wav	3.84	Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_038.wav	2.56	This is a big advantage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_039.wav	3.07	I think we have a very strong case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_040.wav	2.74	We agreed to disagree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_041.wav	3.97	If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_042.wav	2.86	If you look at the beginning of Alien.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_043.wav	3.08	I've learned from my mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_044.wav	3.03	Today is not about contracts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_045.wav	3.25	It should be a great game, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_046.wav	3.63	That says something for his strength of character.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_047.wav	3.63	You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_048.wav	2.86	It's to do with play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_049.wav	3.42	Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_050.wav	2.95	I've just got to do this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_051.wav	3.67	Rangers will have a massive support in Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_052.wav	2.48	That was the problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_053.wav	3.76	Ministers are not involved in these discussions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_054.wav	2.91	I have been here for only three months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_055.wav	2.31	Everything else is second.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_056.wav	2.78	I think it is a sensible change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_057.wav	2.43	Sex is fun?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_058.wav	3.33	They were not doing it too well, either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_059.wav	3.54	He added, It's not a racial problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_060.wav	3.33	He had played well in that central role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_061.wav	3.12	We hope this scheme will change that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_062.wav	2.86	It was created by genocide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_063.wav	3.33	It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_064.wav	2.91	How could anyone take issue with that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_065.wav	2.86	He takes time out for everyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_066.wav	3.50	The decision is an absolute disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_067.wav	3.72	Now, just two games into the season, he has gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_068.wav	3.16	A number of people could not speak English.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_069.wav	3.20	They have got off with murder.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_070.wav	3.03	They had had time for little else.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_071.wav	3.54	Both of those promises have already been honoured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_072.wav	3.20	We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_073.wav	3.63	It probably didn't feel anything, she added.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_074.wav	2.86	The settlement could run to millions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_075.wav	2.56	It does not stop at the border.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_076.wav	3.93	We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_077.wav	2.43	How can they say that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_078.wav	2.77	Robert is a special talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_079.wav	5.12	John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_080.wav	3.33	She added, It is a huge problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_081.wav	2.65	You can't keep them separate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_082.wav	2.65	I still feel like a wee boy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_083.wav	3.72	He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_084.wav	2.35	But there was a shift.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_085.wav	3.41	Israel has done very little until now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_086.wav	3.12	Debate was impassioned and furious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_087.wav	2.39	We are losing this war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_088.wav	2.69	A decision is expected today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_089.wav	2.78	The death rates are still as high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_090.wav	3.24	For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_091.wav	3.20	There is a growing anger among the group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_092.wav	3.07	We certainly will need to watch him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_093.wav	2.95	I don't think it could be clearer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_094.wav	3.50	He put some colour into Scottish history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_095.wav	3.20	Our offer will remain on the table.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_096.wav	2.69	We are trying to establish a date.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_097.wav	2.69	He is a man who lives to work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_098.wav	3.42	The website is now being amended.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_099.wav	2.65	It was a bit of a struggle today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_100.wav	3.84	If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_101.wav	3.50	It's amazing it happened in the daytime.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_102.wav	3.38	This is thought to mean sometime next week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_103.wav	2.60	He had a heart problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_104.wav	3.59	The breakdown was much later in her life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_105.wav	3.55	I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_106.wav	2.95	That was the light relief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_107.wav	2.78	I am a wealthy person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_108.wav	2.94	He has one son and one daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_109.wav	3.12	He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_110.wav	2.91	That, he claimed, was essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_111.wav	3.16	I have great respect for all my players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_112.wav	3.97	Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_113.wav	2.74	He had other things on his mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_114.wav	2.99	I hadn't seen them in eight years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_115.wav	3.33	Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_116.wav	3.11	The next few months will tell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_117.wav	3.37	It felt like my support system was leaving.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_118.wav	2.69	It is crucial for both teams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_119.wav	2.69	I am happy with my form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_120.wav	2.65	You can see their point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_121.wav	4.87	Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_122.wav	3.12	They married in August last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_123.wav	3.71	However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_124.wav	3.46	Yet he chose to do something different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_125.wav	4.52	He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_126.wav	3.12	There were no casualties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_127.wav	3.50	I've just got to build on this now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_128.wav	2.91	I was pleased with my own game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_129.wav	2.99	The case will now go to appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_130.wav	3.25	They really did a great job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_131.wav	3.46	A teacher is, really, about unity.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_132.wav	2.99	Where is the anthrax?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_133.wav	2.78	Bombing is the easy option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_134.wav	3.54	I love you so very much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_135.wav	3.54	Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_136.wav	3.55	The road was closed for several hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_137.wav	3.03	They can be time consuming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_138.wav	4.53	In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_139.wav	3.29	I had a tie in my hand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_140.wav	3.59	A world away from Rangers, you might say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_141.wav	3.42	Sean Connery did not disappoint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_142.wav	3.29	Such a city does not exist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_143.wav	3.20	My aim is a top six finish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_144.wav	3.93	We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_145.wav	3.16	This has a number of benefits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_146.wav	3.20	There is too much at stake for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_147.wav	3.20	That is in the very nature of farming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_148.wav	2.86	These matters are now behind us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_149.wav	3.88	To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_150.wav	3.97	Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_151.wav	2.95	I love the tradition of vaudeville.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_152.wav	2.86	It was then into overtime.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_153.wav	2.86	Most of the public are behind me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_154.wav	4.27	Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_155.wav	3.50	Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_156.wav	3.03	I am still very much a director.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_157.wav	4.01	I might have been sitting at home, with her out here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_158.wav	3.71	But we are severely limited in funds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_159.wav	3.63	In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_160.wav	4.14	Meanwhile, the problems of Ball continue to multiply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_161.wav	3.12	My house was shaking at the time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_162.wav	3.12	They will know they deserve to be there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_163.wav	2.27	Of course he is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_164.wav	3.24	This is a huge confidence boost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_165.wav	3.59	They recorded their debut album in New York.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_166.wav	2.22	And does it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_167.wav	2.74	That's how it worked in Bosnia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_168.wav	3.37	Nobody even knew it had happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_169.wav	3.54	Freedom from Serbia is a growing objective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_170.wav	3.33	She is a very lucky lady.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_171.wav	2.39	Was it a foul?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_172.wav	3.24	Jamming would be equally difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_173.wav	3.03	We've been there for seven years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_174.wav	2.99	He was as good as his word.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_175.wav	2.78	Promises were not kept.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_176.wav	2.82	My life has been destroyed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_177.wav	2.91	His signature is his handwriting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_178.wav	3.46	He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_179.wav	3.63	The sense of excitement in Stirling is tangible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_180.wav	2.65	It's not in my nature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_181.wav	3.20	You see - this business is a good one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_182.wav	1.92	Who is he?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_183.wav	4.23	Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_184.wav	3.80	Our members are concerned about their futures.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_185.wav	2.95	It was that bad, that low.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_186.wav	4.14	It also highlighted some local hero districts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_187.wav	4.05	The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_188.wav	2.90	It worked, up to a point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_189.wav	2.73	There was no rescue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_190.wav	4.31	This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_191.wav	3.24	I can't stand this sort of stuff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_192.wav	4.10	It's fun and challenging, but it is not easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_193.wav	4.95	NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_194.wav	2.56	Is Saddam a threat?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_195.wav	3.38	We've got a great defensive club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_196.wav	3.37	Darrell was, however, adamant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_197.wav	3.50	The rear of the plane was on fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_198.wav	3.08	I feel privileged to be here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_199.wav	2.78	I'm not afraid of that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_200.wav	3.80	If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_201.wav	3.50	She told me to apply for the crest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_202.wav	2.95	He explained to his audience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_203.wav	3.12	I think the Government should pay for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_204.wav	3.33	I never made any offer to Mark.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_205.wav	3.41	The actors are confident and polished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_206.wav	2.73	The budget was too low for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_207.wav	3.25	All inquiries should be made to the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_208.wav	2.52	I'm a bit annoyed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_209.wav	2.65	On that they agree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_210.wav	2.73	I just could not cope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_211.wav	3.76	The outcome is now in our own hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_212.wav	3.20	It is all one-sided.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_213.wav	4.40	Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_214.wav	3.50	Here are some possible solutions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_215.wav	3.33	IT was a thoroughly modern affair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_216.wav	2.60	They were both very brave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_217.wav	3.33	He made so many bad decisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_218.wav	2.82	We are now up against it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_219.wav	4.44	It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_220.wav	2.90	I would have dropped out otherwise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_221.wav	3.46	She said No, he's not in Elgin today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_222.wav	3.93	Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_223.wav	3.84	Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_224.wav	3.03	But the row refused to go away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_225.wav	3.20	Our biggest threat is the BBC.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_226.wav	2.44	Bill is a mentor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_227.wav	3.89	They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_228.wav	3.29	This must be really short of ideas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_229.wav	3.29	I think he has undergone a sea change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_230.wav	3.12	I believe you may be that person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_231.wav	2.48	It was a big day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_232.wav	2.78	What makes a house a home?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_233.wav	3.55	I think however, he was having a fit!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_234.wav	4.10	At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_235.wav	2.78	I will not be pressured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_236.wav	2.69	I had another good day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_237.wav	2.26	I hate the word.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_238.wav	3.08	We should be trying to keep him in.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_239.wav	3.55	The casting of her husband was an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_240.wav	2.39	I would say so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_241.wav	3.76	Even for a British Open, this is different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_242.wav	3.33	I was the only one arguing differently.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_243.wav	3.37	Sub Not Used, McKay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_244.wav	4.82	From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_245.wav	3.12	Mind you, who wouldn't?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_246.wav	3.59	That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_247.wav	3.59	The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_248.wav	2.82	It was a tactical change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_249.wav	2.95	She had kept the news from him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_250.wav	3.67	When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_251.wav	3.16	With this line-up, they didn't need to be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_252.wav	3.42	We have a lot of sympathy for applicants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_253.wav	3.76	There are so many artists working in Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_254.wav	3.20	One of these problems is the railways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_255.wav	3.88	Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_256.wav	3.12	We don't have the credible evidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_257.wav	3.03	It's one up to the Scots.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_258.wav	2.65	I'm just doing artwork.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_259.wav	2.43	He is a right bastard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_260.wav	3.03	I don't want to use the term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_261.wav	3.63	And we still have to pay his salary.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_262.wav	2.61	Also, he was flawed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_263.wav	3.50	Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_264.wav	2.86	So there's a double whammy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_265.wav	2.56	I didn't have a trio.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_266.wav	3.80	Their three other children had died as infants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_267.wav	2.56	We knew nothing about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_268.wav	2.69	She is a great talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_269.wav	3.20	I hope my successor will do the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_270.wav	2.99	I learned that only yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_271.wav	3.03	We do things in an appropriate way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_272.wav	3.76	I have been totally taken aback by this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_273.wav	2.65	Are you in this movie?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_274.wav	2.86	We have got a full house tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_275.wav	4.95	The things writers and directors say!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_276.wav	2.78	The fans will support us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_277.wav	3.67	Is this new report the answer?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_278.wav	3.41	It was a long process, but we got there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_279.wav	3.33	It has, however, been a long time coming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_280.wav	3.42	We need to be looking to the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_281.wav	2.60	The whole team was rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_282.wav	3.80	But when he left, the decision was forced upon us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_283.wav	3.88	Some of the players have not progressed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_284.wav	3.29	It is quite an eye opener.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_285.wav	2.52	You've got it coming Kabul.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_286.wav	2.99	They must act now to tighten the rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_287.wav	3.76	Quite simply, no-one else is willing to do so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_288.wav	3.42	It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_289.wav	3.41	But, mainly, it is up to ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_290.wav	2.90	Are his works inside out?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_291.wav	3.97	There is a cup final at stake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_292.wav	3.42	It's the curse of our time, irony.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_293.wav	3.63	It was not a difficult decision, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_294.wav	3.03	It's a source of deep concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_295.wav	2.82	I am not a free trader.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_296.wav	3.24	There were so many characters among them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_297.wav	3.71	It is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_298.wav	4.10	However, there are also many areas of agreement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_299.wav	3.72	Last month he made his debut in Japan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_300.wav	3.16	The Dow Jones is way up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_301.wav	3.12	Now there's an even bigger target.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_302.wav	3.63	They were the better side on the day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_303.wav	3.29	No decision on that was taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_304.wav	2.56	What went wrong?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_305.wav	3.25	There is nothing like a fresh start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_306.wav	2.99	They chose to side with terror.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_307.wav	2.43	This must have been severe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_308.wav	2.86	We're all in a state of shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_309.wav	3.03	I thought he was part of the camera.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_310.wav	3.84	Farmers have been an endangered species.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_311.wav	3.59	We are in a learning curve.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_312.wav	3.42	Why should we have been asked to share?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_313.wav	4.10	He was released in March this year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_314.wav	3.59	She was just that sort of person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_315.wav	3.97	Surrey police said no body had been found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_316.wav	3.41	Instead, she just went away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_317.wav	3.37	I've seen some of the submissions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_318.wav	3.67	The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_319.wav	3.08	It was chaotic and frightening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_320.wav	2.99	I think in three dimensions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_321.wav	2.60	It is a question of balance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_322.wav	3.03	Soon the whole country will be level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_323.wav	2.86	He's very young but he is growing up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_324.wav	3.84	The Chosen One doesn't always excel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_325.wav	3.29	I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_326.wav	3.16	Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_327.wav	3.20	We could not have asked for any more.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_328.wav	3.29	Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_329.wav	3.29	People might not actually want the job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_330.wav	4.18	It is the logical extension of audio description.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_331.wav	3.29	His rival's are spoken with elan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_332.wav	4.35	The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_333.wav	3.16	I have a bunch of veterans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_334.wav	2.31	I am not retiring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_335.wav	3.37	He also was in debt to drug dealers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_336.wav	3.84	The package has been properly costed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_337.wav	4.57	I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_338.wav	2.69	We will work through the night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_339.wav	3.12	Barry will be able to handle this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_340.wav	3.59	This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_341.wav	3.59	We just need the Government to act.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_342.wav	2.78	The urgency is real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_343.wav	3.63	The criminal justice system does not do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_344.wav	3.46	He will never walk the streets again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_345.wav	3.93	We're very excited and challenged by the project.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_346.wav	5.93	JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_347.wav	3.84	The science is well known, the solution is simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_348.wav	3.97	They are just bewildered and very concerned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_349.wav	2.99	I can't stop people thinking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_350.wav	3.93	The workers said they were treated like animals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_351.wav	2.78	That's the last thing he will do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_352.wav	3.50	I have not been so angry for years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_353.wav	2.26	I am ready for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_354.wav	2.26	Do you mean today?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_355.wav	3.38	This is normal for him now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_356.wav	3.25	But my heart is in athletics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_357.wav	3.08	Nobody ever gets to see them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_358.wav	3.24	A review group will report on Tuesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_359.wav	3.46	Yet he left a few days later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_360.wav	3.37	The place became a war zone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_361.wav	2.99	What's happening to her?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_362.wav	4.14	It was to get even better for Motherwell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_363.wav	4.48	Both parties can win, and Scotland can win as a result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_364.wav	3.59	The surprise is its product is so poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_365.wav	2.77	I don't have a new house.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_366.wav	3.67	It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_367.wav	3.50	Thus the story will continue to thrive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_368.wav	2.99	Horses have some sense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_369.wav	3.20	The plot is minimal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_370.wav	2.86	See it while you can.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_371.wav	2.95	The plane was in flames
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_372.wav	3.37	But then, that really is the point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_373.wav	2.82	One policeman was killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_374.wav	4.52	I didn't do too badly myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_375.wav	4.53	Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_376.wav	3.25	We have been working together for some years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_377.wav	3.12	Chris Paterson is a class act.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_378.wav	3.16	He has never even been to Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_379.wav	3.16	And that's the question for the Chamber.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_380.wav	2.78	Do what you have to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_381.wav	2.78	I'm getting back up there now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_382.wav	3.29	We believe the squad will stay together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_383.wav	4.10	But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_384.wav	2.99	There is a lot of anger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_385.wav	3.24	We suspect he was pleased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_386.wav	3.03	It was meant to rival the dollar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_387.wav	4.27	Mary is, as it were, the cause of her mother's death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_388.wav	2.99	She always wanted her own way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_389.wav	2.69	Maybe, who knows?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_390.wav	3.46	And the funny thing is, they usually do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_391.wav	3.37	Everything is surrounded by confusion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_392.wav	2.30	It was a sell-out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_393.wav	4.01	We welcome the proposals, but they must get on with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_394.wav	2.61	If there is default.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_395.wav	4.06	She can't say where she was, what she did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_396.wav	2.65	I'll take what comes along.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_397.wav	3.80	Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_398.wav	3.33	She will just have wanted her baby.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_399.wav	2.78	Scotland is losing business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_400.wav	2.86	We are working on the two things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_401.wav	2.82	We only lost the third goal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_402.wav	3.63	Women reported more depression than men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_403.wav	3.59	We will have to see, but it makes you think.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_404.wav	3.37	The euro is your money, it is our money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p299\p299_405.wav	4.18	Nothing has been going for us, but what can you do?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_001.wav	2.31	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_002.wav	4.48	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_003.wav	9.26	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_004.wav	6.44	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_005.wav	7.72	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_006.wav	6.62	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_007.wav	5.12	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_008.wav	9.17	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_009.wav	6.23	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_010.wav	4.10	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_011.wav	8.49	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_012.wav	5.46	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_013.wav	5.63	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_014.wav	5.89	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_015.wav	6.83	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war on heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_016.wav	8.61	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_017.wav	3.76	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_018.wav	6.27	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_019.wav	7.85	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_020.wav	4.82	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_021.wav	9.77	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_022.wav	8.02	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_023.wav	12.70	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_024.wav	8.58	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_025.wav	4.70	Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_026.wav	3.84	This is not a floating Las Vegas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_027.wav	3.76	It is not an amnesty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_028.wav	5.13	The important thing was to be there, and to experience it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_029.wav	3.59	Of course, this is nice to hear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_030.wav	4.57	It was between myself, the management, and the team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_031.wav	3.12	I don't believe you own anything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_032.wav	4.14	The music industry hasn't changed at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_033.wav	4.61	There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_034.wav	4.14	Blood samples have been taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_035.wav	4.69	Someone came down and said, Can you read a script?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_036.wav	3.80	He said he now intends to fly today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_037.wav	4.31	This means that our programme is quite unusual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_038.wav	4.70	Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_039.wav	4.82	A further police inquiry is currently being held.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_040.wav	4.74	Some people begin to turn away, to go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_041.wav	3.29	You're not stopping people using sunbeds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_042.wav	4.18	A recording contract is on the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_043.wav	3.80	It has been a horrible, horrible time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_044.wav	4.10	We like being the underdogs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_045.wav	4.10	They said construction work could begin within weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_046.wav	4.31	We will continue to operate within the sport.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_047.wav	4.44	But the law is very clear on this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_048.wav	4.99	But all forms of the illness are treatable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_049.wav	4.23	It is also central to the unfolding drama.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_050.wav	3.89	Except for this, it was offside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_051.wav	5.12	On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_052.wav	3.67	It's a grey area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_053.wav	4.44	Retirement, who knows?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_054.wav	4.44	He was shocked by what he saw.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_055.wav	4.91	Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_056.wav	3.29	It comes on like a tidal wave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_057.wav	3.88	England and Wales are likely to pull out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_058.wav	5.59	Mr Cook, a left-winger from Britain, would be ideally placed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_059.wav	4.87	He was taken ill in December last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_060.wav	4.14	We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_061.wav	3.42	It's all too short term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_062.wav	4.65	This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_063.wav	4.65	Meanwhile, the weather was causing widespread disruption.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_064.wav	4.23	Robin Williams is very subdued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_065.wav	3.76	His rival's are spoken with elan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_066.wav	3.72	He also does not get along with Christina.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_067.wav	4.52	If convicted, they face the death penalty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_068.wav	3.76	How things have changed since then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_069.wav	5.12	Therefore, it isn't getting the respect it deserves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_070.wav	4.99	This is the way things should be handled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_071.wav	3.76	For me, the tour is wide open this year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_072.wav	4.52	In the past few years, they have started to fight back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_073.wav	4.65	The Prime Minister was very honest and sincere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_074.wav	4.65	What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_075.wav	4.78	She opens tonight in Glasgow, at the King's Theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_076.wav	4.82	Henman is taking nothing for granted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_077.wav	3.67	You'd think there was a match on today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_078.wav	2.86	We must move on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_079.wav	3.63	Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_080.wav	5.38	The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_081.wav	4.70	His options are severely limited.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_082.wav	3.46	This is truly field of miracles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_083.wav	3.42	They are not an item.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_084.wav	4.36	Why did they let him go?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_085.wav	6.79	Another suggestion was dismissed by Virgin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_086.wav	4.83	I have made good progress.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_087.wav	5.33	We do need a new one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_088.wav	4.61	They had to be cut from the wreckage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_089.wav	4.44	We defended well, but couldn't do much in attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_090.wav	4.23	What happens when the funding is exhausted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_091.wav	4.61	He then had a swipe at Hearts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_092.wav	4.87	According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_093.wav	3.46	But the relief was short-lived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_094.wav	4.14	You had better believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_095.wav	3.50	The mood is upbeat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_096.wav	4.31	He told us about it the next day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_097.wav	4.91	It's not a new concept in jazz.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_098.wav	5.04	There are a huge number of arts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_099.wav	5.76	They are, therefore, not in favour of dispersal of sex offenders.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_100.wav	3.59	My office is bare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_101.wav	5.81	Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_102.wav	4.78	Where is the anthrax?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_103.wav	5.64	Housing is in very short supply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_104.wav	4.44	After all, he is the King of Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_105.wav	2.94	People just came on their own.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_106.wav	4.48	We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_107.wav	4.36	The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_108.wav	4.57	You either have him or you don't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_109.wav	5.55	There are some new buildings in there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_110.wav	3.03	I am prepared to step down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_111.wav	2.86	I'm not a diva.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_112.wav	4.01	There is great relief at this point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_113.wav	4.36	Look at them after three days of rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_114.wav	4.10	I didn't realise it had reached that stage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_115.wav	3.88	There is no point in pushing it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_116.wav	4.61	He was the deputy editor at the paper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_117.wav	4.36	Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_118.wav	5.68	Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_119.wav	4.53	Completion is expected by October the following year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_120.wav	4.53	However, it very nearly all went wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_121.wav	4.52	It is not a definite proposal as yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_122.wav	3.24	I will speak to Michael about this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_123.wav	4.06	This is not understood by people outside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_124.wav	3.80	I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_125.wav	4.06	Wallace was a prisoner of war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_126.wav	4.61	There is a lack of chemistry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_127.wav	2.90	I went straight to the toilet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_128.wav	4.61	She says the royal family get on well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_129.wav	4.06	Does a firefighter have to be killed?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_130.wav	4.57	Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_131.wav	4.36	That group reported just before Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_132.wav	4.40	I've always been desperate to play this part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_133.wav	4.70	We haven't actually considered it down here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_134.wav	4.05	There is still much work to be done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_135.wav	4.14	However, details have yet to be worked out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_136.wav	3.71	All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_137.wav	3.97	One of them, a woman, is in serious condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_138.wav	4.44	We were with him the whole time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_139.wav	4.88	From then on, Scott has never looked back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_140.wav	4.27	All manner of precaution and protection are taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_141.wav	2.95	That's because we work hard at it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_142.wav	3.80	This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_143.wav	4.06	He's been the key to everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_144.wav	4.91	Since then, my life has been turned upside down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_145.wav	4.40	Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_146.wav	5.25	They said to me, Why don't you get into acting, Tommy?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_147.wav	3.16	We need a new kind of theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_148.wav	11.01	I was in the train station overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_149.wav	2.90	I feel my life to be at risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_150.wav	4.78	Again and again, at every level, he delivered the goods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_151.wav	3.38	That would be poetic, wouldn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_152.wav	3.54	We came across the first set of bodies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_153.wav	3.20	We need some confidence to get a win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_154.wav	4.01	Does that put pressure on us?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_155.wav	1.88	You've seen the polls then, Sean.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_156.wav	2.82	This is a foolish idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_157.wav	3.84	You might even have seen him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_158.wav	4.61	Sussex Police refused to give any further details.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_159.wav	4.06	They thought they had found a home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_160.wav	4.57	She collapsed and died a day later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_161.wav	4.23	You should be there with six different characters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_162.wav	3.55	Laura is an investment banker.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_163.wav	3.97	I took a minibus into town.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_164.wav	2.77	I do my job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_165.wav	3.38	Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_166.wav	4.99	Running costs are not subsidised by public money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_167.wav	4.70	Where are his symphonies and major concertos?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_168.wav	3.33	Four policemen were wounded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_169.wav	3.41	Who do these people think they are?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_170.wav	4.36	What has caused the demise of singing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_171.wav	5.72	We want to help them through it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_172.wav	3.38	It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_173.wav	2.82	It has been recorded twice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_174.wav	5.42	It was a bit like having children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_175.wav	3.29	You cannot eat in the dining room.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_176.wav	3.93	It is very difficult to find a buyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_177.wav	4.35	It shows that we are civilised society.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_178.wav	4.91	It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_179.wav	4.65	I came home by ambulance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_180.wav	3.72	You will never forget the clutching horror.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_181.wav	5.08	This was extremely foolish behaviour on your part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_182.wav	4.61	She is living proof of their expertise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_183.wav	3.63	This one was my best chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_184.wav	4.40	We believe a third party was involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_185.wav	2.69	I am writing a novel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_186.wav	3.97	A bit of match fitness is required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_187.wav	4.01	All were paid by the taxpayer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_188.wav	4.48	The fate of large numbers remains unknown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_189.wav	4.78	It was located on the remote control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_190.wav	4.87	The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_191.wav	3.63	Twaddle is a case in point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_192.wav	4.19	These elements are not in the book.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_193.wav	3.50	You look at them and you understand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_194.wav	3.03	I am considered a teenager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_195.wav	3.29	I would like Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_196.wav	2.86	The FBI could become involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_197.wav	3.85	We have only nine months to go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_198.wav	3.46	Both of them have looked good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_199.wav	4.65	I like footballers who play well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_200.wav	5.42	It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_201.wav	5.04	The talking is going on, but the Iraqi people will survive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_202.wav	3.42	Well that's very New Labour, isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_203.wav	4.01	It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_204.wav	4.18	Donald was a man with many friends.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_205.wav	3.84	We played them off the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_206.wav	4.27	It is turning that way all across Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_207.wav	5.25	Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_208.wav	4.86	We were on top and could've won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_209.wav	4.61	That night was a terrible muddle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_210.wav	5.16	The next time he saw her, she was a different person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_211.wav	3.76	He ended up a headmaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_212.wav	4.44	He was too good for me - too consistent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_213.wav	5.25	It is like being a qualifier again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_214.wav	5.51	David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_215.wav	5.25	If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_216.wav	4.91	Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_217.wav	4.10	I told you, you were doing it all wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_218.wav	3.97	Roy Keane is certainly the best.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_219.wav	3.93	I might get an injury very easily.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_220.wav	4.14	There are a lot of unanswered questions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_221.wav	3.80	A world away from Rangers, you might say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_222.wav	3.93	That was a stunning drive from Jon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_223.wav	3.63	She didn't tell us anything new.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_224.wav	3.59	There is nothing like this back home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_225.wav	3.63	And that gives a kind of freedom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_226.wav	4.70	I found a fault and it worked at it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_227.wav	3.93	It was a poor performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_228.wav	5.33	They may yet have the last laugh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_229.wav	3.88	You can feel at home in China.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_230.wav	4.86	This is all part of opening the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_231.wav	6.28	We have tried to keep his head up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_232.wav	6.06	For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_233.wav	3.88	He will become the sovereign.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_234.wav	5.08	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_235.wav	4.52	Everyone could see it apart from Kevin Keegan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_236.wav	5.76	The success story shows no signs of stopping.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_237.wav	4.40	This is a huge boost for my confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_238.wav	4.05	It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_239.wav	3.50	It's just gotten too big.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_240.wav	4.40	Was all this really just five months ago?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_241.wav	4.06	The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_242.wav	3.54	They were two different types.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_243.wav	4.01	It need not be like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_244.wav	5.34	At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_245.wav	4.65	Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_246.wav	4.40	Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_247.wav	4.10	The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_248.wav	4.65	However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_249.wav	5.76	He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_250.wav	4.74	Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_251.wav	3.54	I am totally horrified by the sentence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_252.wav	4.31	I just saw them for a few minutes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_253.wav	5.04	A management agreement, however, was conceded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_254.wav	5.17	People would say, He thinks he can do that as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_255.wav	4.31	The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_256.wav	3.76	Our objective is to tackle poverty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_257.wav	3.93	Two things will count for us in Brussels.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_258.wav	4.10	Today's meeting was open and friendly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_259.wav	4.91	It is the stop-gap before extinction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_260.wav	4.35	He must have something up his sleeve.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_261.wav	5.34	If it wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_262.wav	4.65	They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_263.wav	4.74	That means no more taxation by stealth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_264.wav	4.70	History may repeat itself with Billy Elliot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_265.wav	4.48	Holland won by five wickets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_266.wav	5.55	His expulsion would not solve the problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_267.wav	6.79	After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_268.wav	3.84	Once they go away they won't come back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_269.wav	3.97	THE best marriages are made in heaven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_270.wav	3.76	The main thing is that they enjoy it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_271.wav	3.93	It is worse because she suffers from angina.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_272.wav	3.84	We have to sort it out ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_273.wav	4.14	The board has rejected her proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_274.wav	4.40	It does not move, which is amazing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_275.wav	3.24	She is a very lucky young lady.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_276.wav	4.06	The threat to rural areas is real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_277.wav	4.31	Tourism continues to struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_278.wav	5.46	That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_279.wav	5.46	But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_280.wav	5.25	THE US is a diverse and colourful nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_281.wav	3.71	This is a great shame.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_282.wav	3.42	That was merely their initial problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_283.wav	4.61	I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_284.wav	3.42	We said, What do you mean?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_285.wav	3.67	I need them to set my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_286.wav	3.29	The law will take its course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_287.wav	4.40	They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_288.wav	4.99	It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_289.wav	3.80	The fund has three elements.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_290.wav	4.14	This is still a young team, you know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_291.wav	3.71	It's not even finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_292.wav	3.50	Everyone knew where they were.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_293.wav	4.65	As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_294.wav	6.36	In the old days, it was easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_295.wav	7.55	People will make up their own minds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_296.wav	5.77	After that he became more romantic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_297.wav	6.53	There is bound to be a formal complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_298.wav	5.21	My view has now completely changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_299.wav	4.10	They finished second and third.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_300.wav	4.40	We agreed to disagree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_301.wav	4.05	He was then replaced by Ross.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_302.wav	5.12	It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_303.wav	3.46	I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_304.wav	5.76	We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_305.wav	3.16	People can get them if they want.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_306.wav	2.99	Their message was simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_307.wav	4.27	They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_308.wav	4.23	He is a law unto himself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_309.wav	4.31	With him are the symbols of his faith.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_310.wav	4.05	There are no easy solutions to this problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_311.wav	3.97	An aide was constructed to get a copy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_312.wav	4.74	The Allies intend to maintain the average.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_313.wav	4.10	Part of Johnny was found some days after.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_314.wav	4.27	It is just completely erased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_315.wav	3.12	A great deal has been achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_316.wav	3.59	I've been thinking about it for a year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_317.wav	3.93	I enjoy playing with both of them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_318.wav	2.52	Too often it is not.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_319.wav	3.03	I tend not to look back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_320.wav	4.31	Confidence among the allies began to slip.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_321.wav	2.91	I got a yellow card.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_322.wav	5.42	Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_323.wav	3.20	I don't know what he was capable of.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_324.wav	3.67	Our place as artists is to ask questions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_325.wav	3.97	It's good to start with Judith.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_326.wav	4.23	She is now on the back benches.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_327.wav	3.16	It may also be her last.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_328.wav	3.33	Maybe it helps us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_329.wav	3.37	Three bystanders were killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_330.wav	5.51	She should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_331.wav	4.99	However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_332.wav	3.50	He made no big mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_333.wav	4.78	There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_334.wav	2.56	We will be homeless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_335.wav	3.50	I believe he can do a better job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_336.wav	6.06	Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_337.wav	5.42	Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_338.wav	4.36	That decision was applauded by Williamson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_339.wav	4.91	But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_340.wav	3.54	Well, was it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_341.wav	3.76	We won't let you down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_342.wav	3.59	What kind of person is he?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_343.wav	4.52	Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_344.wav	5.12	He was visited by UK consular officials.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_345.wav	5.17	So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_346.wav	3.33	English is the language of pop music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_347.wav	4.52	The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_348.wav	4.14	It is a simple equation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_349.wav	4.95	She has seen, or heard, it all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_350.wav	4.61	Which Scot is likely to emulate his achievements?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_351.wav	3.93	This time, however, there is a new venue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_352.wav	3.59	Who has the second highest?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_354.wav	5.51	You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_355.wav	5.08	I didn't even have the first idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_356.wav	3.08	No person was charged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_357.wav	4.18	I've only met him three times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_358.wav	4.06	You see, my back has gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_359.wav	5.59	It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_360.wav	3.93	She looked very, very poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_361.wav	4.78	Nato has completed planning for air strikes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_362.wav	4.18	Butcher has only one idea in mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_363.wav	4.18	This is not great, but it goes well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_364.wav	3.55	It's an hour of the same response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_365.wav	3.29	Both are national treasures.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_366.wav	2.99	And here is the rub.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_367.wav	3.63	They are also exploited by the markets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_368.wav	3.67	Stewart will travel with some confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_369.wav	3.16	I am really looking forward to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_370.wav	4.35	I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_371.wav	2.95	This takes the pressure off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_372.wav	4.36	If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_373.wav	3.41	I will never get over his death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_374.wav	3.46	My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_375.wav	5.59	We were very happy with our results, which were excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_376.wav	3.72	The mix with Tiger is perfect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_377.wav	4.74	Well, it happened to me, so it's happening to him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_378.wav	3.24	Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_379.wav	4.70	They should have some measure of protection.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_380.wav	3.29	They did not threaten anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_381.wav	3.24	Who is going to pay their wages?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_382.wav	4.82	There is no hiding place in it, no room for passengers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_383.wav	3.59	Even then he was in the media spotlight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_384.wav	4.19	But this is not just a Tibetan issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_385.wav	3.46	That's the kind of thing that counts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_386.wav	3.38	Construction would then begin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_387.wav	5.08	Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_388.wav	3.63	A century on, little has changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_389.wav	3.89	It is a temptation which should be resisted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_390.wav	4.66	Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_391.wav	3.41	Form and structure are his music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_392.wav	4.40	I don't have any bitterness about it, it's just a fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_393.wav	3.63	Is the Welsh assembly going to go?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_394.wav	3.63	The award was a lifeline for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_395.wav	6.19	Victory, she insisted yesterday, was far more important than the rewards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_396.wav	5.55	For all his successes, he is accustomed to waiting for fulfilment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_397.wav	4.44	A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_398.wav	4.06	We expect to come through on Thursday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_399.wav	4.57	Equally the employee could claim a public interest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p300\p300_400.wav	2.99	Six other people were injured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_001.wav	2.52	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_002.wav	6.62	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_003.wav	10.16	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_004.wav	6.83	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_005.wav	8.02	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_006.wav	7.00	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_007.wav	6.06	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_008.wav	9.48	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_009.wav	5.97	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_010.wav	4.57	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_011.wav	8.58	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_012.wav	6.79	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_013.wav	5.89	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_014.wav	6.28	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_015.wav	7.34	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_016.wav	8.45	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_017.wav	5.12	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_018.wav	6.92	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_019.wav	9.26	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_020.wav	5.94	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_021.wav	10.63	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_022.wav	8.15	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_023.wav	12.72	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_024.wav	9.13	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_025.wav	4.78	But it was a great decision he joked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_026.wav	4.14	They changed the world of music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_027.wav	4.61	You need a long-term strategy in football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_028.wav	4.31	The law has got to be upheld.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_029.wav	4.01	But we're not the same person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_030.wav	4.48	He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_031.wav	3.80	I saw the explosion and panicked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_032.wav	5.76	The punishment was swift.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_033.wav	6.15	However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_034.wav	5.08	I kept my side of the bargain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_035.wav	4.01	It also makes for interesting viewing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_036.wav	5.59	Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_037.wav	4.95	He released a half-dozen solo albums.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_038.wav	5.08	That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_039.wav	5.68	There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_040.wav	4.82	Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_041.wav	4.01	It doesn't make them evil.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_042.wav	4.53	I have played really well all year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_043.wav	5.12	Parts of the system are already overstretched.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_044.wav	5.51	Tourism in Scotland is facing a financial disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_045.wav	5.12	It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_046.wav	5.76	She added, It is the same story in both countries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_047.wav	4.99	Lara is very, very much a girl.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_048.wav	4.06	I try not to expect anything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_049.wav	5.13	Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_050.wav	4.95	There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_051.wav	3.63	It was, however, the wrong side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_052.wav	3.54	She is now planning a visit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_053.wav	5.16	It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_054.wav	5.72	Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_055.wav	5.12	Today, we begin to answer that question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_056.wav	5.29	No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_057.wav	3.93	I keep my fingers crossed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_058.wav	4.65	The encounter was to change his life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_059.wav	4.14	It's the best of both worlds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_060.wav	5.04	They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_061.wav	4.91	That is why we want this decision reversed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_062.wav	5.97	It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_063.wav	4.95	Staff were invited to make their own proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_064.wav	5.30	We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_065.wav	4.65	After this, the exercise was due to begin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_066.wav	5.21	And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_067.wav	6.19	I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_068.wav	6.61	CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_069.wav	5.25	I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_070.wav	6.70	When he took over it really took off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_071.wav	5.55	That's just the way the game is evolving.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_072.wav	4.91	Michael is putting on a brave face.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_073.wav	4.95	Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_074.wav	5.16	The next thing will be cutting journey times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_075.wav	4.91	It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_076.wav	3.97	This is a mental challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_077.wav	4.78	Their one weakness was running between the wickets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_078.wav	5.51	He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_079.wav	7.09	Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_080.wav	4.44	Ferguson did not hesitate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_081.wav	4.61	He came in an army uniform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_082.wav	6.96	However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_083.wav	3.80	Cars are great for going long distances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_084.wav	4.23	It was published yesterday on the internet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_085.wav	5.29	I knew he would play two weeks ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_086.wav	6.19	The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_087.wav	4.70	It has never been worthwhile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_088.wav	4.87	So other options had to be explored.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_089.wav	5.47	He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_090.wav	4.44	We will learn lessons from what has happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_091.wav	4.23	People love to see this stuff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_092.wav	5.72	One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_093.wav	4.95	Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_094.wav	5.63	His female companion was being treated for shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_095.wav	5.42	I have no plans to change the oath.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_096.wav	4.99	We did not even get a free kick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_097.wav	4.65	He was married with a young child.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_098.wav	5.51	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_099.wav	4.57	Anyone remaining after that will be targeted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_100.wav	4.27	They serve a multitude of purposes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_101.wav	5.55	But his attendance is not guaranteed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_102.wav	4.19	I am sure all schools would accept that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_103.wav	3.97	I am very sorry to be here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_104.wav	4.61	I needed a change, a new challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_105.wav	6.57	Is your life a little too easy?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_106.wav	5.04	I think my game is suited to grass.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_107.wav	6.70	The little boy was playing football at lunchtime.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_108.wav	5.28	Industry leaders reacted angrily.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_109.wav	4.52	Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_110.wav	4.74	People want to see me on the screen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_111.wav	6.19	The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_112.wav	6.23	And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_113.wav	5.29	The conversion didn't go over either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_114.wav	4.40	He took away my childhood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_115.wav	5.25	They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_116.wav	4.65	The motive for the shooting was not known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_117.wav	4.91	Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_118.wav	6.28	Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_119.wav	4.27	It is not great art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_120.wav	4.61	You do not change overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_121.wav	5.00	The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_122.wav	7.26	One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_123.wav	6.36	Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_124.wav	4.95	We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_125.wav	4.14	We aim to put them out of business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_126.wav	5.72	Tony Blair should get out more.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_127.wav	5.85	We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_128.wav	3.76	He was just awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_129.wav	5.17	We now have to concentrate on the league.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_130.wav	4.01	We need to move forward together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_131.wav	4.19	She died in hospital two hours later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_132.wav	5.04	She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_133.wav	4.36	Both were later released after a check-up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_134.wav	5.34	No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_135.wav	4.78	How good is Lennox Lewis?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_136.wav	4.23	I would ask the fans to be patient.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_137.wav	4.65	The ethos of the school was outstanding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_138.wav	4.61	The son has autism and other problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_139.wav	3.63	I'm very puzzled by it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_140.wav	5.21	Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_141.wav	5.25	Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_142.wav	6.02	We are both very confused and extremely angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_143.wav	4.61	All things are possible if you believe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_144.wav	5.29	This was not just incongruous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_145.wav	3.97	It is patently true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_146.wav	4.10	You hope he prevails.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_147.wav	6.19	And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_148.wav	5.30	The fellowship is much more than a commission, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_149.wav	5.21	What the Department of Transport will make clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_150.wav	5.00	But it looks good for next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_151.wav	5.72	I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_152.wav	4.23	He is wanted by German police for questioning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_153.wav	3.42	He was forced to quit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_154.wav	4.44	It is good for their eyesight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_155.wav	3.67	I was loving that little girl.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_156.wav	3.80	But you can't have it both ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_157.wav	4.23	We don't just play golf in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_158.wav	4.61	That's why the young musicians have joined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_159.wav	4.10	The death toll included five children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_160.wav	5.04	Before the game we went for a pint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_161.wav	5.08	There is no credible official announcement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_162.wav	4.69	I understand the medical concerns.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_163.wav	4.23	This is a United Kingdom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_164.wav	4.78	I thought it was a fantastic game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_165.wav	4.23	I am aware that somebody made a threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_166.wav	5.12	However, who could have predicted this result?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_167.wav	5.64	Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_168.wav	5.42	As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_169.wav	4.35	They were behind the wheel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_170.wav	5.00	The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_171.wav	5.25	The problem arises because he does so much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_172.wav	4.14	The answer is mayhem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_173.wav	4.65	Our young people are leaving.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_174.wav	4.48	What, then, is the real thing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_175.wav	5.08	I can't believe anyone would agree with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_176.wav	5.12	That will be the sweetness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_177.wav	5.64	But is it ethical to practice in humans?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_178.wav	4.91	The big issue for us is the review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_179.wav	4.27	There was a fossil on screen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_180.wav	5.34	I always loved the lightning in the movies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_181.wav	4.61	This does not create any precedent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_182.wav	5.12	I see social work as a vocation, a commitment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_183.wav	4.52	It has removed a bit of guilt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_184.wav	5.25	I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_185.wav	4.74	You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_186.wav	4.66	The early evidence suggests he did not.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_187.wav	5.30	Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_188.wav	3.76	I hope you miss the cut.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_189.wav	5.38	The role was perfect for Russell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_190.wav	6.92	Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_191.wav	6.70	We are seeking funds from government departments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_192.wav	8.67	That, though, was again according to manager McCall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_193.wav	6.74	He scored one goal and was on fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_194.wav	6.36	I hate to say it, but you can understand it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_195.wav	5.17	Harold is a rarity.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_196.wav	5.12	Walk out the door and anything can happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_197.wav	4.27	I want him to take on Gomez.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_198.wav	5.00	Her condition last night was described as critical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_199.wav	3.84	Frankly, it was worth the booking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_200.wav	6.36	They tend to be easily influenced by others.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_201.wav	3.12	Well, what do you know?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_202.wav	5.38	There are some serious ethical issues involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_203.wav	5.47	If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_204.wav	6.15	Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_205.wav	5.46	He will emerge as a world leader.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_206.wav	5.98	It opens the door to the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_207.wav	6.44	It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_208.wav	5.85	We have no choice but to shut down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_209.wav	4.14	The prognosis is excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_210.wav	4.91	They always want to give a performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_211.wav	4.95	But he just carried on anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_212.wav	5.72	Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_213.wav	5.21	I would not want to be young again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_214.wav	6.40	Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_215.wav	4.31	The Yugoslav army will still be there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_216.wav	4.99	There are schoolboys in uniform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_217.wav	4.87	They were later discharged from hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_218.wav	5.77	These findings would be made public.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_219.wav	4.78	What are you not good at?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_220.wav	5.50	All the lads are totally focused on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_221.wav	6.06	He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_222.wav	4.18	This makes no sense!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_223.wav	5.04	I go home only once.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_224.wav	4.18	It had a gigantic effect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_225.wav	7.21	I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_226.wav	5.33	If not, a deal could take many months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_227.wav	4.40	The team this year is going places.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_228.wav	6.02	More money for students would help - in an ideal world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_229.wav	4.91	It took more than two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_230.wav	6.53	Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_231.wav	4.78	He said because people had invited him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_232.wav	4.31	That's the key issue isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_233.wav	4.70	Its workforce is to be made redundant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_234.wav	4.52	Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_235.wav	5.21	Correction, knowing him, he might.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_236.wav	4.83	I came up through the ranks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_237.wav	5.72	Why does she suddenly win everything now?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_238.wav	6.23	We wanted it left for a wee while.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_239.wav	5.38	These guys will not lie down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_240.wav	5.97	The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_241.wav	5.21	That is nearly four people every day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_242.wav	5.13	There are nine people here now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_243.wav	4.49	His son is a local legend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_244.wav	8.04	Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_245.wav	4.83	Which perhaps is just as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_246.wav	4.57	It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_247.wav	4.70	He would just say it was terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_248.wav	3.85	This is the New Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_249.wav	5.59	I saw military vehicles in the distance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_250.wav	4.74	I hope it has helped the prisoners.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_251.wav	5.76	We kept going right to the final whistle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_252.wav	5.80	For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_253.wav	9.09	JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_254.wav	4.91	The final stage is paranoia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_255.wav	5.51	I am not holding the club to ransom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_256.wav	5.55	Wagner was never like this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_257.wav	5.33	Pig farmers are completely despondent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_258.wav	6.06	But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_259.wav	7.90	We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_260.wav	6.10	That's the sort of game you want.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_261.wav	4.74	We're not travel agents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_262.wav	5.80	Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_263.wav	5.21	We are trying to clarify the issues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_264.wav	4.18	It's the same old story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_265.wav	3.71	He was telling me to keep quiet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_266.wav	3.97	It was a moment of madness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_267.wav	4.78	I do not own the vessel in question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_268.wav	4.74	Racism has no place in any sport.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_269.wav	6.06	I am not happy with proposals for widows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_270.wav	4.87	It is believed she had serious head injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_271.wav	5.04	Bombing is the easy option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_272.wav	5.94	Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_273.wav	6.01	We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_274.wav	6.10	The pilot was making a visual approach.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_275.wav	4.81	I'd say we should give it a week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_276.wav	6.62	Many other Scottish locations also feature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_277.wav	5.63	Little Voice is on general release.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_278.wav	5.46	That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_279.wav	4.53	There is no substitute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_280.wav	3.71	That nation is South Africa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_281.wav	5.00	This will secure the future of our industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_282.wav	4.49	The police have an awful lot to explain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_283.wav	5.21	Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_284.wav	4.87	That's when you hope to take advantage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_285.wav	4.86	It was an empowering journey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_286.wav	5.64	The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_287.wav	5.25	It's not unlike the millennium bug.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_288.wav	5.89	They had been together for about three years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_289.wav	4.95	Children are using books in a terrible condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_290.wav	5.34	Everything has been destroyed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_291.wav	7.73	The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_292.wav	5.50	He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_293.wav	5.16	We just want to get stuck in now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_294.wav	3.84	Do you come from Moscow?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_295.wav	4.27	Broomfield was the centre of the town.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_296.wav	4.95	He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_297.wav	3.50	They are the innocent victims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_298.wav	4.23	We are aware of the tribunal case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_299.wav	4.95	That is the first job of the director - leadership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_300.wav	5.94	Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_301.wav	5.68	But he was a full, working member of our staff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_302.wav	5.17	Broke the birdie record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_303.wav	4.78	Either group is living in fantasy land.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_304.wav	4.61	They tried to give her advice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_305.wav	5.12	That it is a brand name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_306.wav	5.16	We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_307.wav	5.59	Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_308.wav	4.61	They will have to make changes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_309.wav	5.38	This fact is supported by audience research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_310.wav	4.65	Of further privacy, he had no need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_311.wav	4.53	Both sides have to step back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_312.wav	5.29	Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_313.wav	5.25	They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_314.wav	6.06	It sounds a bit of an own goal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_315.wav	5.00	We are ready for the long haul.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_316.wav	5.81	We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_317.wav	4.14	I look for dancers who are also actors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_318.wav	6.28	However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_319.wav	4.06	EMI is a prime example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_320.wav	4.78	I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_321.wav	5.00	The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_322.wav	4.40	It's a record label, not a form of music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_323.wav	4.14	Not that Agassi was a believer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_324.wav	3.50	A friendship that will endure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_325.wav	5.12	Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_326.wav	4.91	It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_327.wav	4.23	Nowadays, it is workers united.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_328.wav	3.67	He is young but not too young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_329.wav	4.95	I played well on Saturday and again today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_330.wav	6.10	It will also take evidence from consumers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_331.wav	6.32	He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_332.wav	3.67	I am not obsessed with sex.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_333.wav	4.87	They've been at it for five hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_334.wav	3.37	There is no answer to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_335.wav	4.40	There was no let-up for the minnows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_336.wav	5.08	Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_337.wav	3.33	His English counterpart agreed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_338.wav	5.29	It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_339.wav	6.27	He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_340.wav	4.44	Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_341.wav	5.12	I am not putting myself down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_342.wav	3.03	He's a joy to follow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_343.wav	3.71	Bob Dylan is getting old.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_344.wav	4.44	We were lucky to have survived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_345.wav	4.78	Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_346.wav	5.17	At this level, you have all to perform well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_347.wav	4.74	I just want to change my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_348.wav	4.31	He did not oppose the divorce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_349.wav	5.47	Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_350.wav	4.06	And Michael was just great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_351.wav	4.40	He knew it would cost him millions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_352.wav	5.12	Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_353.wav	5.47	Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_354.wav	5.68	Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_355.wav	5.89	That only came out during a radio interview.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_356.wav	4.44	We are now setting about finding them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_357.wav	5.12	They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_358.wav	4.23	We must not go down that road.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_359.wav	5.55	It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_360.wav	3.80	I am not among its admirers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_361.wav	4.70	And that match was played in June.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_362.wav	4.91	He will address the nation this evening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_363.wav	6.15	They have shown a great desire and attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_364.wav	5.04	I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_365.wav	4.10	Motherwell have no such good fortune.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_366.wav	4.74	But he is revelling in the big stage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_367.wav	4.44	Stock markets will be watching closely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_368.wav	5.25	If they have City backing, what is the influence?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_369.wav	5.63	Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_370.wav	5.25	Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_371.wav	5.50	There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_372.wav	4.48	His job was not advertised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_373.wav	4.53	And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_374.wav	4.44	Scottish life can be like this, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_375.wav	3.84	He has changed my life for ever.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_376.wav	5.17	The home was now under new management.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_377.wav	5.03	It is like a theatre of the absurd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_378.wav	4.05	There is no openness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_379.wav	5.21	It's being very carefully looked at.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_380.wav	3.84	It was a job he loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_381.wav	4.57	It may encourage more people to prospect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_382.wav	5.38	Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_383.wav	5.72	Where was their passion, the power, the feeling?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_384.wav	3.25	It looks like paradise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_385.wav	5.04	At the moment, it is being treated as a tragic accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_386.wav	4.10	We were short of athletes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_387.wav	4.83	They want to avoid a flashpoint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_388.wav	6.15	They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_389.wav	5.89	The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_390.wav	6.62	Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_391.wav	4.01	I had no qualms about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_392.wav	4.74	Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_393.wav	4.52	McMaster had already seen the first part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_394.wav	5.59	It's about my time as a guitarist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_395.wav	5.17	We have been working closely with Holyrood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_396.wav	3.80	It was early morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_397.wav	4.10	Partition is not an option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_398.wav	4.70	What other retailer would do this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_399.wav	4.27	This is usually done by the space shuttle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_400.wav	4.74	Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_401.wav	3.38	I won't go back to Holland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_402.wav	4.69	In his absence, the council adopted the change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_403.wav	3.20	There was no cohesion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_404.wav	6.02	He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_405.wav	4.23	Whether this return was too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_406.wav	4.35	Jackson may well be right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_407.wav	3.33	My thoughts are with their families.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_408.wav	2.99	I saw some good things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_409.wav	5.12	Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_410.wav	3.93	Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p301\p301_411.wav	4.65	Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_001.wav	2.48	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_002.wav	4.14	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_003.wav	7.38	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_004.wav	5.08	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_005.wav	7.26	She can spoon these things into her three bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_006.wav	6.53	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_007.wav	4.82	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_008.wav	8.96	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_009.wav	3.67	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_010.wav	4.52	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_011.wav	6.06	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_012.wav	4.65	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_013.wav	1.15	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_014.wav	6.62	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_015.wav	6.02	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the god to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_016.wav	6.44	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_017.wav	5.51	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_018.wav	6.02	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_019.wav	6.53	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_020.wav	4.83	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_021.wav	8.80	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_022.wav	6.78	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_023.wav	13.14	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green yellow light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_024.wav	6.36	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_025.wav	3.29	It does make a big difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_026.wav	5.21	George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_027.wav	3.72	Each one has its own system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_028.wav	4.91	Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_029.wav	4.06	From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_030.wav	3.76	It is a very special city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_031.wav	4.36	It has been blown out of all proportion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_032.wav	3.37	He's not very big, either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_033.wav	3.16	I've taken to the hills.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_034.wav	4.48	My game is in pretty good shape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_035.wav	4.40	How come it is so often unnoticed?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_036.wav	3.29	I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_037.wav	3.59	We used to keep our business rates.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_038.wav	4.44	It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_039.wav	3.08	All of us do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_040.wav	4.31	On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_041.wav	4.01	It could have been just a quick fix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_042.wav	3.03	We are looking for volunteers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_043.wav	3.71	Theatre is not a museum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_044.wav	3.08	Subs not used, McCulloch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_045.wav	4.18	Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_046.wav	3.16	He could face a jail sentence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_047.wav	3.59	They don't take you to mass graves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_048.wav	4.91	What's it got to do with art?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_049.wav	10.66	Happily we found it in the library.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_050.wav	5.33	I know a lot of people who don't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_051.wav	4.74	There was nobody on the roof.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_052.wav	5.29	He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_053.wav	4.06	We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_054.wav	4.70	It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_055.wav	4.31	The days of empty promises are over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_056.wav	3.12	Henry was strong and talented.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_057.wav	3.63	I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_058.wav	4.06	We must improve our relations with the government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_059.wav	3.33	Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_060.wav	4.53	Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_061.wav	4.91	Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_062.wav	4.14	He said it was the worst possible result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_063.wav	5.21	The quality of life is difficult for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_064.wav	5.04	Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_065.wav	5.72	It is just part of modern day life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_066.wav	4.23	A young Briton had a lucky escape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_067.wav	4.06	Treatment is not an issue with these people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_068.wav	4.74	YOU thought it was a headache.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_069.wav	3.50	I hope we can put it behind us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_070.wav	3.33	But it was to no avail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_071.wav	3.93	There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_072.wav	3.97	I'm thinking, what would be easier?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_073.wav	3.50	That alibi is now gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_074.wav	2.95	We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_075.wav	3.65	He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_076.wav	3.33	You do have a way out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_077.wav	2.90	It is simple, really.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_078.wav	4.48	I cannot believe she has been admonished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_079.wav	3.74	I was in jail for five years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_080.wav	3.08	You, the British people, are the boss.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_081.wav	4.10	A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_082.wav	3.97	PR for Westminister is their holy grail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_083.wav	3.72	They won the trophy in the Hoops.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_084.wav	4.40	I never won a penny throughout my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_085.wav	4.63	Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_086.wav	4.27	She could easily have been killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_087.wav	4.23	Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_088.wav	4.87	We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_089.wav	5.16	It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_090.wav	3.93	The same goes for personnel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_091.wav	3.67	He was a crazy man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_092.wav	3.07	We don't say there wasn't a massacre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_093.wav	4.23	That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_094.wav	3.59	The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_095.wav	3.33	There was an element of jealousy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_096.wav	4.31	Craig is still suffering seizures.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_097.wav	3.80	Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_098.wav	4.57	That certainly brought me back down to earth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_099.wav	4.74	Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_100.wav	5.21	We have no idea what caused the derailment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_101.wav	4.23	Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_102.wav	4.10	Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_103.wav	5.72	He is only now regaining his confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_104.wav	4.91	Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_105.wav	4.01	It separates the men from the boys.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_106.wav	3.46	But the attachment took a lot of growing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_107.wav	4.10	You'll get on like a house on fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_108.wav	3.84	Two and a half million people have died.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_109.wav	2.43	Or so it would appear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_110.wav	3.59	I hope they understand that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_111.wav	4.78	Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_112.wav	3.63	She will also get a pay rise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_114.wav	3.37	It is time for a more honest approach.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_115.wav	3.37	The move is considered a major breakthrough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_116.wav	4.95	I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_117.wav	4.05	I want to play at the highest level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_118.wav	3.25	Stalkers are capable of killing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_119.wav	3.97	It ignores the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_120.wav	3.20	Britain may now be forced to listen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_121.wav	3.84	The trial is set for February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_122.wav	4.19	Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_123.wav	3.46	Do not go into government buildings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_124.wav	3.37	There is only one caveat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_125.wav	3.03	We are still getting signals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_126.wav	4.14	And perhaps it is as simple as that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_127.wav	3.84	They prefer the short, intensive session.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_128.wav	3.16	THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_129.wav	3.76	The New Deal will constantly be improved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_130.wav	3.80	THE headless man has finally developed a face.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_131.wav	4.06	I heard some of his remarks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_132.wav	4.06	Mary Archer is almost too clever.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_133.wav	3.59	I was just overwhelmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_134.wav	3.89	It has been in place since last July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_135.wav	3.67	The European Court is our only option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_136.wav	3.76	Do you think they would be any better?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_137.wav	3.71	We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_138.wav	4.10	Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_139.wav	4.31	The singer's condition was not specified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_140.wav	4.44	How much of a cop out is that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_141.wav	3.16	The whole region is in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_142.wav	3.54	It will be the final push.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_143.wav	3.38	Lord Levy said he'd started his life with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_144.wav	2.61	You were the kidnappers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_145.wav	4.10	It is a very interesting subject.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_146.wav	4.35	The women were on their way home yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_147.wav	3.08	I could feel the blood on my face.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_148.wav	4.27	The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_149.wav	4.61	Well, it's not before time, is it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_150.wav	3.80	Debbie Harry was cool.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_151.wav	4.70	Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_152.wav	3.46	That sort of thing is long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_153.wav	4.01	I'm afraid to say anything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_154.wav	3.29	I know you went back this morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_155.wav	3.50	We did not want an absentee landlord.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_156.wav	4.27	These men could be anywhere in the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_157.wav	3.93	Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_158.wav	4.65	A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_159.wav	3.93	It's my favourite place to hang out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_160.wav	3.93	Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_161.wav	4.18	He will make an excellent chief inspector.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_162.wav	3.24	The red card was okay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_163.wav	5.25	Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_164.wav	4.31	But they will not be compelled to join.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_165.wav	3.55	However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_166.wav	4.31	I was doing well at the hustings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_167.wav	5.21	But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_168.wav	4.48	After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_169.wav	3.12	We must put a marker down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_170.wav	5.04	But she's also beautiful behind the face.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_171.wav	4.53	There is no date on this document.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_172.wav	3.71	And now he tells us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_173.wav	4.19	Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_174.wav	3.07	They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_175.wav	3.80	It is time to come into the limelight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_176.wav	3.89	It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_177.wav	3.33	His name is Michael Owen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_179.wav	2.60	I will have to order its destruction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_180.wav	3.59	I foolishly had done nothing about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_181.wav	4.19	Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_182.wav	4.40	By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_183.wav	2.90	Smith has not let him down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_184.wav	3.24	No, it's actually in a block of flats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_185.wav	3.54	Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_186.wav	2.90	They have two children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_187.wav	3.37	Luckily, our patient was stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_188.wav	3.50	I'm really proud of my young players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_189.wav	2.95	People buy everything with cash.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_190.wav	3.03	There was great support all round the route.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_191.wav	3.12	It's amazing it happened in daytime.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_192.wav	3.63	I felt we had fallen back a little.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_193.wav	4.95	Scottish fishermen comended the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_194.wav	3.59	Or so we have long assumed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_195.wav	4.35	Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_196.wav	5.21	To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_197.wav	4.36	It's not just for classical music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_198.wav	4.49	This must be kept in total perspective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_199.wav	3.54	All the names are familiar to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_200.wav	3.46	They had not been handcuffed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_201.wav	4.36	It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_202.wav	4.14	I've never been limited on drugs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_203.wav	3.97	They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_204.wav	4.49	Have we not had the rainy season already?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_205.wav	4.10	We have chosen for the patients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_206.wav	3.97	He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_207.wav	4.78	Why should we even be asked to share?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_208.wav	3.89	Which means it matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_209.wav	3.93	There is a great potential on this river.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_210.wav	4.06	I was surprised by his response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_211.wav	4.10	This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_212.wav	4.40	River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_213.wav	3.93	Officials say the city must achieve this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_214.wav	5.08	It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_215.wav	3.03	Is this accurate?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_216.wav	3.76	A judicial review is also being considered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_217.wav	4.31	It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_218.wav	4.36	They could go no further forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_219.wav	4.70	I don't know why you say goodbye.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_220.wav	4.57	Appointed general secretary last September.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_221.wav	4.14	They make it look very easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_222.wav	4.01	It was a total surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_223.wav	3.88	I had enough on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_224.wav	2.52	And we're not there yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_225.wav	3.67	No meaningful response was issued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_226.wav	3.88	It is a form of physical exercise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_227.wav	2.91	plays in dark blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_228.wav	4.61	But, by that time, of course, it is again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_229.wav	4.74	It is something that we will put right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_230.wav	3.80	Survival is our aim.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_231.wav	3.76	There is no reason at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_232.wav	4.06	This is her first senior Scottish selection.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_233.wav	3.72	There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_234.wav	3.16	I'm pleased with the horse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_235.wav	3.72	But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_236.wav	3.76	This is a club on the rise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_237.wav	3.33	I had a sense of deja vu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_238.wav	3.80	His silence on the issue is interesting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_239.wav	4.19	They follow him everywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_240.wav	3.46	I couldn't make out what was going on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_241.wav	3.85	There was no safety net.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_242.wav	4.23	So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_243.wav	4.82	I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_244.wav	4.10	I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_245.wav	5.38	Mr Miller is married with three children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_246.wav	3.72	Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_247.wav	4.31	We have great sympathy with Danny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_248.wav	4.65	He should be a great asset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_249.wav	3.72	It means they actually control the programme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_250.wav	4.69	And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_251.wav	4.31	We are not out of touch with politics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_252.wav	4.78	We could have got three medals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_253.wav	5.76	Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_254.wav	3.25	We are at a crossroads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_255.wav	4.14	We are satisfied with this outcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_257.wav	2.48	It didn't take long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_258.wav	3.84	This meeting is the path to salvation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_259.wav	6.32	Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_260.wav	4.69	I started on a fire a couple of times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_261.wav	4.61	He also received a medal of honour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_262.wav	2.90	It's not one for the purists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_263.wav	5.34	She said he showed no remorse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_264.wav	3.33	I'm a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_265.wav	4.44	We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_266.wav	3.71	It is a time bomb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_267.wav	4.35	It's a matter of huge concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_268.wav	4.31	Harrowing is easy, after all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_269.wav	4.40	Three years probation is just a joke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_270.wav	4.61	The outstanding issues are still there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_271.wav	4.44	Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_272.wav	4.86	I'm not sure how they got there, but they are.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_274.wav	4.61	He always has been, since his early days with Scottish Opera.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_275.wav	3.80	That got me out of jail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_276.wav	3.20	We have turned the corner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_277.wav	4.14	This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_278.wav	3.89	The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_279.wav	4.91	Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_280.wav	4.23	However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_281.wav	4.01	We have taken steps to rectify it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_282.wav	3.37	I see no need for change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_283.wav	3.97	Do yourselves a favour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_284.wav	4.70	Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_285.wav	3.54	Others said they had been beaten by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_286.wav	3.80	The new system will be marketed this summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_287.wav	3.54	I'd love to be like Peter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_288.wav	3.03	They came into collision with Sergio.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_289.wav	6.19	We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_290.wav	3.88	Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_291.wav	3.59	He is a success story by any standard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_292.wav	3.50	Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_293.wav	4.74	I shall be voting Yes to support him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_294.wav	3.25	Is something which we just don't do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_295.wav	3.08	We work on the same level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_296.wav	3.33	I've got a young family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_297.wav	3.71	I'm trying to stay open on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_298.wav	3.41	It all seemed so easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_299.wav	3.12	I really don't understand what is happening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_300.wav	3.20	The frustration was showing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_301.wav	4.44	Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_302.wav	3.12	I am a wealthy person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_303.wav	4.10	My friends were very envious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_304.wav	3.63	The snipers are also out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_305.wav	3.84	Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_306.wav	3.20	We are determined to establish the facts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_307.wav	3.16	The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_308.wav	4.35	The list is too long for this piece.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_309.wav	3.38	If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_310.wav	3.08	Entries for the event are still being accepted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_311.wav	3.76	It plans to return to this field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_312.wav	3.64	However, there was no hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_313.wav	2.90	To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_314.wav	3.55	Tonight's matches European Championship.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_315.wav	2.52	It's like the Russians.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p302\p302_316.wav	3.88	Is that Titanic?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_001.wav	3.76	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_002.wav	5.21	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_003.wav	8.71	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_004.wav	7.34	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_005.wav	8.52	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_006.wav	7.34	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_007.wav	5.98	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_008.wav	10.12	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_009.wav	6.75	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_010.wav	4.61	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_011.wav	7.98	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_012.wav	6.70	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_013.wav	7.17	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_014.wav	6.10	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_015.wav	7.90	The Greeks used it to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_016.wav	8.66	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_017.wav	5.12	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_018.wav	7.00	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_019.wav	8.07	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_020.wav	5.46	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_021.wav	11.52	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_022.wav	9.65	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_023.wav	13.36	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_024.wav	9.90	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_025.wav	5.04	It is bad news for the flooded areas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_026.wav	5.34	There will be widespread support on all sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_027.wav	5.59	This was the classical period of Beethoven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_028.wav	4.95	That is just a load of baloney.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_029.wav	5.38	I was never going to play against Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_030.wav	4.44	Any error of judgment was ruled out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_031.wav	5.85	For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_032.wav	3.76	The feeling is marvellous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_033.wav	4.14	I think they should have more respect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_034.wav	4.95	The crackdown is launched today by the government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_035.wav	5.93	They are interior designers and architects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_036.wav	4.44	Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_037.wav	5.25	Others may be trying to catch up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_038.wav	4.61	It was a crucial moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_039.wav	4.53	We gave everything we had.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_040.wav	6.70	I let go the telephone and ran.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_041.wav	5.42	For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_042.wav	5.38	His charisma is all on the course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_043.wav	4.74	This is purely financial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_044.wav	5.17	I will not be in dialogue with her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_045.wav	6.66	Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_046.wav	5.76	I did not want any damage to us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_047.wav	4.99	It was an easy decision to come here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_048.wav	5.59	I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_049.wav	4.57	However, you have just got to adjust to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_050.wav	4.10	I saw them not long after it happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_051.wav	5.04	This guy is never going to give up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_052.wav	4.61	Who said impatience is a virtue?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_053.wav	7.00	Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_054.wav	6.66	You've got to have everything inside with you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_055.wav	5.98	But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_056.wav	5.17	Several hundred people attended yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_057.wav	5.00	It was more like a Labour Party rally.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_058.wav	4.61	In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_059.wav	5.81	The partnership was set up during the summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_060.wav	4.87	Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_061.wav	6.15	The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_062.wav	5.46	Don't say you have not been warned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_063.wav	5.21	That is a mark of what you are.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_064.wav	3.80	Seven children had lost both parents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_065.wav	3.59	It is par for the course, isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_066.wav	5.13	Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_067.wav	3.93	Most people know that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_068.wav	4.74	Some people still think she should be English.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_069.wav	5.72	Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_070.wav	4.14	Repayment is not part of the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_071.wav	4.48	The cause of the crash was unclear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_072.wav	7.43	What do they pay to join the club?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_073.wav	5.89	Two people are allowed to share the duty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_074.wav	4.95	We are now in a safe place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_075.wav	5.47	She goes to the opening of an envelope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_076.wav	5.46	It will be very useful for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_077.wav	6.28	He was obviously very genuine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_078.wav	4.48	We just try to make great records.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_079.wav	4.70	She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_080.wav	4.91	I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_081.wav	5.21	It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_082.wav	5.42	Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_083.wav	4.27	His parenthood is called into question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_084.wav	4.17	Audacious decisions were taken early on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_085.wav	5.59	We really need research to help with that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_086.wav	5.93	In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_087.wav	4.18	There were no passengers on board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_088.wav	5.85	At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_089.wav	5.29	It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_090.wav	4.01	Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_091.wav	5.63	There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_092.wav	7.47	These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_093.wav	6.06	He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_094.wav	3.85	Scotland were beaten again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_095.wav	4.52	The Premier League has been a huge success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_096.wav	4.95	The League of Nations was also his idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_097.wav	4.57	I've done it almost like a variety show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_098.wav	4.74	She is on a life support machine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_099.wav	3.97	Their vision was not impeded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_100.wav	5.76	Sooner rather than later, though, the healing must begin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_101.wav	4.35	The election is total confusion and chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_102.wav	4.70	Next league matches, Dundee United - Kilmarnock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_103.wav	4.10	He went to see what he could learn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_104.wav	6.23	It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_105.wav	4.83	Referees are easy targets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_106.wav	4.35	The luxury has been well used.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_107.wav	5.12	Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_108.wav	5.89	Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_109.wav	4.99	We think all other measures are not exhausted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_110.wav	4.14	There was no time scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_111.wav	4.48	Only the scale of change differed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_112.wav	4.10	Tell you the team he picked?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_113.wav	5.59	Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_114.wav	3.25	The cold war is over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_115.wav	3.63	I'd like to take the plunge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_116.wav	4.82	Lately, that market has come under pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_117.wav	3.63	And it's more subversive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_118.wav	4.01	We are losing this war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_119.wav	5.81	Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_120.wav	5.98	After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_121.wav	4.19	They will know they deserve to be there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_122.wav	3.33	I've got no secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_123.wav	5.42	In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_124.wav	5.76	John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_125.wav	4.61	I asked why he had come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_126.wav	4.65	Will they ever reopen?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_127.wav	6.87	After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_128.wav	3.84	A lot of people were in tears.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_129.wav	4.44	We have great team spirit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_130.wav	4.91	Above all the aggression must be stopped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_131.wav	4.19	He loves the big occasions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_132.wav	5.38	They should take their mobile phones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_133.wav	4.52	He loved his job and working in newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_134.wav	4.22	We have big ideas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_135.wav	4.57	I first met him last summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_136.wav	4.44	It was to be published next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_137.wav	5.76	Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_138.wav	5.68	It could have been a hammering by now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_139.wav	4.74	Subs not used, Fernandez.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_140.wav	5.25	I played really well on the back nine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_141.wav	5.08	It's a bit like a bereavement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_142.wav	6.40	It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_143.wav	5.63	Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_144.wav	7.64	That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_145.wav	5.59	But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_146.wav	5.93	What was going through her mind that day, that night?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_147.wav	4.06	I always knew she was funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_148.wav	3.80	All kinds of things occur.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_149.wav	5.08	I expected these kind of questions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_150.wav	4.44	It was fit for royalty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_151.wav	6.70	It is always the same, isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_152.wav	5.76	Who would take it now, after all this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_153.wav	4.48	I felt really good until Friday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_154.wav	4.48	That gives us something to kick against.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_155.wav	7.85	Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_156.wav	4.87	Equity declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_157.wav	6.23	There is precious little middle ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_158.wav	4.83	She was shouting my baby, my baby.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_159.wav	3.63	The inquiry had been going on for months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_160.wav	4.14	They were both delightful to work with.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_161.wav	4.23	It's my delight on a shiny night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_162.wav	4.65	I'd go anywhere to work, so long as it's worth it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_163.wav	4.35	It's now down in black and white.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_164.wav	3.46	Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_165.wav	5.51	It is quite an eye opener.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_166.wav	4.53	Hillary plans to meet him on the summit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_167.wav	5.80	What, they maybe have three Scottish players?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_168.wav	4.36	Can they be serious?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_169.wav	5.21	For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_170.wav	4.53	That, in our view, is an important decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_171.wav	3.29	It's just that we see different things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_172.wav	5.08	Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_173.wav	3.97	We're all family men with children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_174.wav	5.04	I think we showed that after half time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_175.wav	4.40	Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_176.wav	3.71	A wide range of restrictions are in place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_177.wav	3.63	There was pressure from elsewhere too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_178.wav	4.05	You let a lot of people down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_179.wav	4.02	One person was believed to have been hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_180.wav	4.52	Mistakes are being made on an increasing basis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_181.wav	4.23	We aren't going to play better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_182.wav	4.18	They just would not have run away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_183.wav	4.10	Two men have been charged with his murder.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_184.wav	6.14	Lifeboat is at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow, tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_185.wav	3.84	The guys have really enjoyed it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_186.wav	4.53	Charles Clarke is an idiot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_187.wav	4.14	Our people should be immune.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_188.wav	4.06	Glasgow then took control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_189.wav	3.72	It is simple and easy to use.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_190.wav	6.92	English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_191.wav	4.65	The rear of the plane was on fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_192.wav	4.65	I think we finished fifth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_193.wav	4.27	It was not a foul.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_194.wav	4.01	We know them as mobile telephones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_195.wav	4.65	Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_196.wav	5.29	I don't know exactly what happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_197.wav	5.80	They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_198.wav	4.10	The Government faces a moral dilemma.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_199.wav	4.61	The pressure is on President Bush to deliver.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_200.wav	5.04	But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_201.wav	4.48	It was a very difficult decision for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_202.wav	3.16	I am not a happy man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_203.wav	4.14	You can be sure we will have problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_204.wav	4.48	Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_205.wav	3.29	I'm going with all three.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_206.wav	4.48	Most of them were one-year conscripts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_207.wav	3.03	The line-up is a tasty one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_208.wav	4.10	I don't honestly know how to describe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_209.wav	5.68	He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_210.wav	5.89	He had taken everything from me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_211.wav	4.74	Many, many people don't know who he is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_212.wav	3.67	Suspension will come into force at midnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_213.wav	5.55	They should also have the right to vote.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_214.wav	7.38	All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_215.wav	4.52	WHAT's in a name in this, the age of the Internet?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_216.wav	5.72	People are so negative about the whole business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_217.wav	4.27	They had given up on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_218.wav	4.82	We didn't know if people would turn up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_219.wav	4.31	It has made me feel good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_220.wav	4.83	You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_221.wav	4.53	We have our supporters and our enemies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_222.wav	4.91	She has now been registered as disabled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_223.wav	5.00	Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_224.wav	5.42	I was living with my mum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_225.wav	7.51	It did my image a lot of good!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_226.wav	4.57	This Government believes in parental discipline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_227.wav	5.68	It's been a long, long journey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_228.wav	5.33	That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_229.wav	6.91	But there has never been the time, she said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_230.wav	5.76	This could be one such case, he declared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_231.wav	4.01	I fell in love with ballet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_232.wav	4.57	The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_233.wav	5.59	Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_234.wav	5.59	Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_235.wav	5.81	I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_236.wav	3.16	We're still talking with a few people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_237.wav	4.74	But one shouldn't go by that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_238.wav	4.48	Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_239.wav	4.01	I think in three dimensions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_240.wav	4.61	They had four children together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_241.wav	4.36	Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_242.wav	4.78	Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_243.wav	4.40	How can they engage with the work?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_244.wav	4.06	All were later allowed home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_245.wav	5.12	She has a wonderful mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_246.wav	4.36	There are just two tournaments remaining.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_247.wav	4.52	We're into that build-up now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_248.wav	4.35	It is the end of an era.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_249.wav	3.25	We can just get on with our game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_250.wav	4.05	But first it goes out on TV.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_251.wav	4.06	We're trying to lessen the stigma.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_252.wav	4.83	Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_253.wav	4.52	Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_254.wav	5.13	I learned a lot from her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_255.wav	4.52	We have reacted well to each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_256.wav	5.33	Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_257.wav	5.81	They seem to be backing off from that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_258.wav	4.14	They have a very good method of working.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_259.wav	4.06	Do you think you have a shot?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_260.wav	3.84	I believe we have a good chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_261.wav	3.80	Things were not easy from the outset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_262.wav	4.01	She may even appear in some more films.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_263.wav	3.38	We've had great things in the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_264.wav	3.67	Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_265.wav	4.31	I've seen some of the submissions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_266.wav	2.48	There is no such thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_267.wav	3.50	I feel very strongly about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_268.wav	3.93	It is a difficult thing to explain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_269.wav	3.55	After that nothing could save him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_270.wav	3.72	His treatment has been quite atrocious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_271.wav	3.97	It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_272.wav	3.97	Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_273.wav	4.25	It is now very clear that that doesn't work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_274.wav	3.16	My dad was working in Ayrshire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_275.wav	4.23	There are lots of these women in Finland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_276.wav	4.86	Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_277.wav	3.80	Last year, however, was a different story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_278.wav	4.31	He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_279.wav	3.37	I bought a car at auction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_280.wav	5.59	And who were they anyway, beforehand?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_281.wav	5.17	What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_282.wav	5.59	She had been sexually assaulted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_283.wav	5.25	Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_284.wav	6.70	Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_285.wav	5.04	They are so easy for youngsters to open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_286.wav	4.31	We have been treated with complete contempt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_287.wav	5.76	There is no smoking gun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_288.wav	3.93	It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_289.wav	4.57	Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_290.wav	4.57	If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_291.wav	4.61	The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_292.wav	4.14	I have been coming here for nine years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_293.wav	3.54	I felt under no pressure today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_294.wav	4.36	The Devil is the creator of weapons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_295.wav	4.14	And that was the adults.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_296.wav	6.32	Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_297.wav	4.91	That is a job for the Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_298.wav	4.27	I felt the head was very like me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_299.wav	4.23	And he had much need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_300.wav	4.91	Last night the bombardment was terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_301.wav	3.67	This can only help us go forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_302.wav	3.80	That left a bad taste in my mouth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_303.wav	3.84	But, even so, you always want to try something new.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_304.wav	4.53	Andrew McLellan is no exception.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_305.wav	4.61	His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_306.wav	3.80	Some have other commitments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_307.wav	3.84	Last week, he was taken into hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_308.wav	5.38	He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_309.wav	6.02	No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_310.wav	4.23	The crowd was awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_311.wav	5.47	That was moving the goalposts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_312.wav	4.52	We have the location, which is assured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_313.wav	3.93	Rapid revision was required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_314.wav	5.29	What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_315.wav	3.93	We couldn't go very fast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_316.wav	3.59	Tony Blair, can you see her face?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_317.wav	4.48	Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_318.wav	3.63	We have grown up in Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_319.wav	4.57	They had previously been on five-day notice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_320.wav	3.33	I am proud of those guys.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_321.wav	5.17	It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_322.wav	6.27	It is too early to speculate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_323.wav	5.12	She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_324.wav	4.27	I'll go out and be aggressive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_325.wav	5.89	I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_326.wav	4.74	What is the truth about the cow?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_327.wav	4.82	They will want to watch a winning team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_328.wav	7.43	Who is going to be penalised?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_329.wav	3.29	I feel sorry for the Reds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_330.wav	4.95	The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_331.wav	4.57	Just see where the blood is coming from.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_332.wav	3.07	I have a theory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_333.wav	3.42	In her opinion, the rich are different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_334.wav	3.97	Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_335.wav	4.91	Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_336.wav	4.83	Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_337.wav	4.74	Sentence was deferred for background reports.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_338.wav	4.87	I'm very sad and deeply shocked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_339.wav	3.58	Some of his family still live there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_340.wav	4.57	However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_341.wav	5.08	Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_342.wav	3.59	I get to work with very good people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_343.wav	4.23	A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_344.wav	5.13	Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_345.wav	4.57	And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_346.wav	8.75	I can't blame the fans for getting frustrated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_347.wav	5.97	On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_348.wav	6.23	I can appear to be nice and lovely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_349.wav	5.85	I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_350.wav	4.23	People tended to stay there for some time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_351.wav	4.10	An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_352.wav	4.23	My preference is for the single vaccines.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p303\p303_353.wav	3.54	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_001.wav	2.65	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_002.wav	5.42	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_003.wav	9.05	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_004.wav	6.32	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_005.wav	7.30	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_006.wav	7.17	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_007.wav	7.85	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_008.wav	8.45	These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_009.wav	5.68	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_010.wav	3.97	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_011.wav	8.03	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_012.wav	5.81	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_013.wav	5.08	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_014.wav	5.81	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_015.wav	6.74	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_016.wav	7.26	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_017.wav	5.00	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_018.wav	7.42	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_019.wav	7.56	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_020.wav	5.55	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_021.wav	8.96	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_022.wav	7.89	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_023.wav	11.70	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_024.wav	8.07	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_025.wav	3.16	So we will cut their numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_026.wav	2.26	Who cares about that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_027.wav	4.18	Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_028.wav	3.41	Glasgow is going to be open for business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_029.wav	2.22	I know my job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_030.wav	3.42	The likelihood is that it will be negative.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_031.wav	4.18	In fact, we were all over the shop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_032.wav	4.06	Scottish rugby has given me everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_033.wav	3.46	They agree to meet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_034.wav	3.97	SOMETIMES, it's not what you say that counts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_035.wav	3.80	But there was a heavy price to pay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_036.wav	3.93	The most important thing was to win today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_037.wav	3.63	We have a strong team at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_038.wav	2.61	At half-time you have?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_039.wav	2.73	The butcher is very good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_040.wav	2.65	He is dying from cancer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_041.wav	4.78	However, they will only be found in the wild.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_042.wav	2.91	It was an ambush.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_043.wav	4.61	For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_044.wav	3.55	Scottish sport was not mentioned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_045.wav	3.72	I was doing a charity concert.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_046.wav	3.42	You have to have a sense of humour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_047.wav	3.67	It is not about changing our image.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_048.wav	3.97	We are waiting for advice on the film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_049.wav	3.37	I hadn't been looking after myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_050.wav	3.84	His father said, My son was lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_051.wav	3.84	But they also came with a downside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_052.wav	3.33	She was only doing her job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_053.wav	2.99	Are you listening, All Saints?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_054.wav	3.33	And then came the seventies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_055.wav	2.99	I guess it is down to focus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_056.wav	2.52	I'm very angry about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_057.wav	3.29	I have great respect for all my players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_058.wav	3.20	His track record is not promising.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_059.wav	3.33	For a moment it was all about her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_060.wav	4.23	Sadly, the game will never see his like again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_061.wav	3.42	Trading Places was too obvious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_062.wav	3.16	They don't know how to do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_063.wav	3.16	No details were disclosed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_064.wav	3.67	Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_065.wav	3.50	If you can get away with it, you do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_066.wav	2.90	First is open defiance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_067.wav	3.54	You probably have never seen them before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_068.wav	3.84	Clearly, audiences are unsettled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_069.wav	3.50	We have avoided that at least.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_070.wav	2.99	I love a clever reader.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_071.wav	3.33	I do not believe they are.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_072.wav	4.82	That is completely against Islam.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_073.wav	3.55	Clearly, there will have to be changes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_074.wav	4.57	Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_075.wav	3.20	I will wait until later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_076.wav	3.29	But, of course, it isn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_077.wav	4.70	We are almost at that point, but not quite.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_078.wav	4.18	Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_079.wav	2.18	Could it be?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_080.wav	3.88	It is bad news for us and England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_081.wav	2.86	They had failed to explode.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_082.wav	3.41	We're all involved in deciding where it goes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_083.wav	2.95	I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_084.wav	2.56	Nor should there have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_085.wav	3.37	Smoking is also very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_086.wav	2.10	I have a theory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_087.wav	3.67	He was determined to write a novel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_088.wav	3.07	So is there anything left to say?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_089.wav	2.99	My back is feeling really good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_090.wav	3.16	They've got their own agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_091.wav	3.16	This commitment should be built upon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_092.wav	3.80	It was one he was born to play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_093.wav	3.63	But we are losing that connection.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_094.wav	3.12	He was jailed for five years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_095.wav	3.59	I am about protecting the state pension.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_096.wav	2.48	We will look into it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_097.wav	2.77	But he's not afraid to take risks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_098.wav	3.12	We shouldn't have a rush to judgment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_099.wav	2.52	I live on the streets of Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_100.wav	2.26	Did you get the script?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_101.wav	3.16	This is an exciting time in Scottish politics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_102.wav	3.42	There, you were just a body.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_103.wav	3.89	He will suspend it on Thursday afternoon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_104.wav	2.86	Four people died instantly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_105.wav	2.99	He did not know his daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_106.wav	3.89	Jim Wallace has been running the Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_107.wav	4.23	Our children are the future of our society.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_108.wav	4.14	Nine other passengers were treated at the scene.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_109.wav	3.63	I can't believe it's all gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_110.wav	2.94	I am just going to go for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_111.wav	2.39	We will meet again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_112.wav	3.63	We are about to have our own Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_113.wav	3.71	Part of the complex is historic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_114.wav	2.18	We need to chat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_115.wav	3.33	Justice was not seen today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_116.wav	2.95	Among them are many criminals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_117.wav	2.82	This is not about revenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_118.wav	2.52	How can we ignore it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_119.wav	3.03	It's totally double standards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_120.wav	3.42	Strikers like to go to the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_121.wav	3.67	It's something he works hard at achieving.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_122.wav	3.21	We are taking the back seat on this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_123.wav	2.95	It was a privilege to work for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_124.wav	2.94	But he admits he is deeply upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_125.wav	2.18	We told them in August.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_126.wav	2.44	We are going to have a parade.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_127.wav	2.99	That could be at least five years away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_128.wav	2.05	That is my role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_129.wav	2.35	Everyone can be bought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_130.wav	2.86	You would be a fool not to listen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_131.wav	2.69	No other offers apply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_132.wav	1.92	Have you noticed?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_133.wav	3.03	This is a wonderful honour for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_134.wav	2.82	The Lobby is not failing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_135.wav	2.05	It was a takeover.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_136.wav	3.08	That statement has never been withdrawn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_137.wav	3.63	Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_138.wav	3.12	How many cases have there been?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_139.wav	3.16	But we have to plan for the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_140.wav	3.37	And yet his legacy is doubtful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_141.wav	3.42	This advice was accepted by ministers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_142.wav	3.20	That's a pretty good percentage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_143.wav	3.84	I feel very sad and extremely cut up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_144.wav	3.71	I can't remember a lot about the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_145.wav	2.90	You have to think not.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_146.wav	2.86	This is a total mystery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_147.wav	3.12	They were due to have begun today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_148.wav	2.78	Do not listen to them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_149.wav	3.42	So what makes it so special?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_150.wav	3.12	It will be easier for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_151.wav	2.52	I'm pleased for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_152.wav	4.06	The report will be launched in Glasgow today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_153.wav	2.77	You need a trademark.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_154.wav	2.65	This is our Olympics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_155.wav	3.80	Things are looking pretty positive at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_156.wav	3.25	The tournament has now been cancelled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_157.wav	3.67	My goal was very important to the team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_158.wav	3.20	There are plenty examples.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_159.wav	3.84	This is not a Scottish problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_160.wav	3.63	They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_161.wav	3.03	I have worked with him on projects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_162.wav	3.41	It may be that lifestyle is behind it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_163.wav	3.38	It was nice to get a clean sheet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_164.wav	3.67	And there is no cause for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_165.wav	4.44	I really couldn't believe it had actually happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_166.wav	4.87	What has changed?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_167.wav	4.10	Manchester United were still trying up to yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_168.wav	3.03	It is a symbolic concert.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_169.wav	3.03	He asked me how they were doing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_170.wav	3.42	They would have looked out for each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_171.wav	3.54	I've got three other ideas for the day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_172.wav	3.93	Well it had to be something, that's for sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_174.wav	3.71	On Saturday, it was much the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_175.wav	3.50	I think that's a bit of an invasion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_176.wav	4.06	The result today is an impasse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_177.wav	3.72	Nelson does not disappoint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_178.wav	4.01	Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_179.wav	3.89	The real world is full of competing causes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_180.wav	3.24	They've got to decide to do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_181.wav	3.24	Strathclyde Police declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_182.wav	2.91	These are terrible offences.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_183.wav	3.54	This is it finally finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_184.wav	4.10	An announcement is expected today on their future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_185.wav	3.80	There were so many characters among them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_186.wav	3.07	Or is it the European approach?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_187.wav	2.77	We could not get any possession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_188.wav	1.80	Did you see that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_189.wav	2.73	The cost of war is more than that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_190.wav	2.78	I saw the whole thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_191.wav	3.72	There is a demand for another hospice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_192.wav	3.29	There is a contract in existence for Allan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_193.wav	3.20	Then they were awarded a penalty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_194.wav	2.86	Journalists should make him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_195.wav	4.02	They will have five minutes to decide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_196.wav	3.33	I see that any day now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_197.wav	2.31	But who knows?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_198.wav	3.08	He was tough and relentless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_199.wav	3.03	That would be unlawful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_200.wav	3.08	This guy is amazing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_201.wav	3.54	The same goes for McKenna.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_202.wav	2.86	That is no use.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_203.wav	3.16	They will want to perform well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_204.wav	3.37	We should not worry about other players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_205.wav	3.54	Ownership was the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_206.wav	3.85	Their moment had come, or so they said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_207.wav	3.84	I love the moment of being first.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_208.wav	3.88	Some examples are presented in detail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_209.wav	3.80	You cannot understand it until you experience it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_210.wav	4.35	Anything that can be done, the Government will do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_211.wav	3.50	I sincerely hope that will not change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_212.wav	2.99	Just don't go looking to be shocked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_213.wav	2.82	It was total confusion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_214.wav	2.82	I have learned from him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_215.wav	2.82	Pupils will be the losers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_216.wav	3.63	The position on the euro remains unchanged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_217.wav	3.50	Such actions are rarely popular.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_218.wav	3.29	That is why it is so lyrical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_219.wav	3.41	It isn't a happy memory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_220.wav	3.33	A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_221.wav	2.82	Who would be a referee?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_222.wav	3.29	We have a team to reach the final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_223.wav	3.33	We want to be separate from our neighbours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_224.wav	3.29	He was correct in everything he did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_225.wav	3.37	I see no reason for them to be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_226.wav	3.16	I never agreed with that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_227.wav	3.55	He was dead on arrival at the hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_228.wav	2.99	I don't think it is vital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_229.wav	3.46	But he insisted that victory was possible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_230.wav	2.91	That could run into millions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_231.wav	3.80	It might not survive the process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_232.wav	3.16	The truth is, it is somewhere in the middle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_233.wav	3.20	I'm really excited about the album.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_234.wav	2.90	We were desperate to get the game on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_235.wav	2.65	But there is a possible place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_236.wav	2.73	You can't have it both ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_237.wav	3.33	Offered the gold medal, he declined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_238.wav	3.46	But they will need to play to score.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_239.wav	2.44	He is a joy to watch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_240.wav	2.69	They also have good neighbours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_241.wav	2.09	We are now open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_242.wav	3.25	She said she would not welcome the flowers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_243.wav	3.42	There is no pressure from anyone now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_244.wav	3.42	Now it has become a big picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_245.wav	3.33	We want to learn lessons from that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_246.wav	3.84	He can perform well under pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_247.wav	2.99	I've enjoyed the whole experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_248.wav	4.14	He was totally without that form of fear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_249.wav	3.97	The band was good, and it's been a great day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_250.wav	3.84	ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_251.wav	3.20	They have the cash to do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_252.wav	3.50	This is a defining moment in this parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_253.wav	2.82	He wouldn't have played in all three.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_254.wav	3.03	And that includes the Barnett formula.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_255.wav	2.05	It is a great shame.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_256.wav	3.33	But experts have disputed that statistic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_257.wav	3.84	The council has been open and transparent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_258.wav	3.37	I'll never think of myself as a star.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_259.wav	2.56	I felt he was excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_260.wav	3.03	It was a policy they were against.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_261.wav	3.20	The results are sometimes contentious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_262.wav	3.42	I believe that Scotland has much to gain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_263.wav	3.50	People have been wonderful beyond belief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_264.wav	3.46	Had she enjoyed the experience?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_265.wav	2.82	He has changed the country itself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_266.wav	2.86	The look on his face was something special.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_267.wav	2.65	I can certainly see much better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_268.wav	2.65	We then went to see the headmaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_269.wav	3.03	I needed a little man in the crowd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_270.wav	2.78	It would then be up to the judge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_271.wav	2.22	Are we going to stay up?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_272.wav	2.86	People were actually not on his side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_273.wav	2.69	It was a very difficult period.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_274.wav	2.61	It's all going to clear the debt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_275.wav	4.23	It used to be less than five minutes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_276.wav	2.22	It was by the numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_277.wav	2.73	My Dad is a hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_278.wav	2.31	It is my fault.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_279.wav	2.91	We are not asking for the moon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_280.wav	3.34	That used to be another thing of mine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_281.wav	4.06	At the election we will oppose the euro.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_282.wav	3.59	As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_283.wav	2.90	Teachers have been given the offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_284.wav	2.73	He called for a public inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_285.wav	3.25	I haven't had a lesson in four years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_286.wav	3.50	I played badly, but it happens.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_287.wav	2.86	I have got a wife to feed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_288.wav	2.52	I lost my head.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_289.wav	2.86	What are the barriers?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_290.wav	3.50	He is keen to stay in public service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_291.wav	3.20	You are not going in blind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_292.wav	2.95	You had to go and see him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_293.wav	2.99	She says she has grown up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_294.wav	3.54	He met his wife and married in England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_295.wav	3.29	But it could have been written for her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_296.wav	2.43	It makes no sense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_297.wav	2.95	What will they called?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_298.wav	2.99	We come here in peace, for peace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_299.wav	2.86	He will feel the pain again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_300.wav	4.06	After New Labour, we now have New Unionists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_301.wav	2.86	I can't stand this sort of stuff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_302.wav	2.78	Is Saddam a threat?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_303.wav	2.31	The jury is still out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_304.wav	3.33	Hopefully, they will not go through with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_305.wav	3.07	I can't say that this is very usual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_306.wav	3.12	He is married, with two children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_307.wav	3.67	At Riverside, the rematch was totally different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_308.wav	3.25	We are the gateway to justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_309.wav	3.88	As in battle, the worst thing is waiting for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_310.wav	2.99	We understand the changes in the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_311.wav	2.90	It is a potential factor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_312.wav	3.67	The working families tax credit is far better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_313.wav	2.69	It added to the reverence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_314.wav	2.52	It is too early to say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_315.wav	2.78	It's to do with context.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_316.wav	2.90	David Trimble has sold out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_317.wav	3.76	Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_318.wav	2.14	I don't understand it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_319.wav	3.29	The teenager had been missing for six months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_320.wav	3.12	He was rejected because he had retired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_321.wav	2.73	And then we got off the plane.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_322.wav	2.35	I think it is wide open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_323.wav	2.39	I am totally surprised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_324.wav	2.99	We are all ecstatic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_325.wav	2.48	I hope he has learned from it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_326.wav	3.80	That doesn't just happen, you have to build it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_327.wav	2.69	You are a gambling man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_328.wav	3.84	Who honestly expected anything else?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_329.wav	2.65	The search has been called off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_330.wav	2.31	The matter will come up again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_331.wav	2.78	Our strategy is straightforward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_332.wav	4.14	Surely this is not supposed to happen?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_333.wav	3.67	We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_334.wav	2.90	They were unable to revive him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_335.wav	3.63	This has come as a shock to everyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_336.wav	3.37	Yes, it was too short a night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_337.wav	3.54	It is not for me, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_338.wav	3.29	It really was my favourite.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_339.wav	3.84	That is why this action has been taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_340.wav	3.50	They should be looking at his victims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_341.wav	3.42	There were many positives for this club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_342.wav	3.89	It's all about money, money, money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_343.wav	2.56	There wasn't anything in it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_344.wav	3.46	What do we do for an encore?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_345.wav	3.16	Things start to talk to each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_346.wav	2.99	I would like to stay with Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_347.wav	2.99	Saddam Hussein is a devil.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_348.wav	3.46	Thirty people have applied for his job!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_349.wav	3.93	That is a lot of writing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_350.wav	4.61	There is no excuse for domestic abuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_351.wav	2.86	It is no place for a poet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_352.wav	3.46	There is room for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_353.wav	2.90	My life is in the ballet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_354.wav	4.14	For next season, we have time to restructure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_355.wav	4.14	The truth, of course, is very different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_356.wav	4.40	He has something in common with the Wallabies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_357.wav	4.06	These will take a little time to develop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_358.wav	4.10	This is not a birthday party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_359.wav	3.50	Darren is very, very good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_360.wav	2.78	It's a drop in the bucket.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_361.wav	3.71	I've had a hard time, to be honest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_362.wav	3.97	I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_363.wav	2.94	She is still very poorly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_364.wav	3.29	That's how she wants to remember him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_365.wav	3.67	There was no disruption to services.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_366.wav	3.38	We talk about effective military action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_367.wav	3.20	It was a discussion paper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_368.wav	2.69	My neighbours are horrified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_369.wav	3.84	He had no problem with alcohol.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_370.wav	3.72	This was a very tragic accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_371.wav	4.14	If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_372.wav	3.29	It is the voice of the survivors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_373.wav	3.42	I'm just a piece in the jigsaw.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_374.wav	2.73	I wish him well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_375.wav	4.19	Only the details have to be sorted out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_376.wav	2.86	They say they feel different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_377.wav	2.99	We are in the hat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_378.wav	2.90	Well, what can you do?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_379.wav	2.78	Motorists will welcome this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_380.wav	2.99	It is not the message alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_381.wav	3.03	She failed to win any of them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_382.wav	3.03	He is at war with his knee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_383.wav	2.95	I think we're going to make it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_384.wav	2.82	I didn't know where they were.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_385.wav	3.16	Clubs can only do so much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_386.wav	2.99	Many other areas are coming up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_387.wav	3.24	But it's a subtle process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_388.wav	3.88	But let's not go down that road.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_389.wav	3.76	It is not attempting to offer a solution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_390.wav	2.65	Changes need to be made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_391.wav	2.69	I don't care to recall it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_392.wav	3.50	That's the way things are heading.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_393.wav	2.43	Hard it will be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_394.wav	2.86	He just attracted people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_395.wav	2.78	It was better than a soap opera.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_396.wav	2.90	I doubt it would be genuine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_397.wav	3.07	You must be ready to play anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_398.wav	3.89	It would have been a very explosive issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_399.wav	2.82	It seems a waste of talents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_400.wav	2.90	It is the worst of both worlds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_401.wav	2.65	We need to tighten up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_402.wav	3.12	His body was never found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_403.wav	2.91	Just get on with your job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_404.wav	3.29	We expect a full house on the night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_405.wav	3.25	He said it was his greatest work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_406.wav	2.95	The baby deserves the credit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_407.wav	2.82	They are different types.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_408.wav	3.54	Like everything in Scotland, it takes time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_409.wav	2.60	We are not too surprised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_410.wav	3.50	They are not a set of options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_411.wav	3.16	But it was money well spent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_412.wav	2.90	They would never let him go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_413.wav	2.39	Which is worse?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_414.wav	3.50	At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_415.wav	4.52	Parliament was evenly divided on the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_416.wav	3.38	He took over our lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_417.wav	4.23	I would think they are just behind them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_418.wav	3.07	We would all have liked to run.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_419.wav	3.50	I can understand why they have gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_420.wav	3.16	That, though, was then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_421.wav	3.50	People should not become complacent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_422.wav	2.99	I will go out with him any time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_423.wav	2.99	I would have the hammer in the crowd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p304\p304_424.wav	2.95	Public safety is paramount.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_001.wav	2.31	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_002.wav	4.01	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_003.wav	7.68	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_004.wav	4.91	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_005.wav	7.47	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_006.wav	6.02	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_007.wav	4.78	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_008.wav	9.48	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_009.wav	5.64	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_010.wav	3.29	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_011.wav	7.25	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_012.wav	4.18	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_013.wav	4.99	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_014.wav	4.27	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_015.wav	6.70	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_016.wav	7.00	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_017.wav	4.14	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_018.wav	5.63	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_019.wav	8.24	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_020.wav	4.70	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_021.wav	9.82	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_022.wav	7.42	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_023.wav	11.78	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_024.wav	7.47	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_025.wav	5.33	Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_026.wav	4.27	He added, however, that all options are under review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_027.wav	3.93	We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_028.wav	3.93	They keep the atmosphere in mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_029.wav	4.01	Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_030.wav	2.35	It is a catalogue of obstruction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_031.wav	2.74	I'm happy to contribute to that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_032.wav	3.58	Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_033.wav	3.46	We had a reunion last week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_034.wav	3.59	We have high hopes that this will work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_035.wav	4.95	Everyone around the club was supportive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_036.wav	5.38	People ask about the concept of a team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_037.wav	3.50	Who has he fought?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_038.wav	2.44	I want a free vote.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_039.wav	3.59	He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_040.wav	3.50	It would show them a positive way forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_041.wav	3.24	Players were held in equally low regard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_042.wav	3.50	He also admitted possessing a firearm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_043.wav	3.29	He stands on Centre Court alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_044.wav	3.88	Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_045.wav	2.39	There was a fine line to tread.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_046.wav	3.24	They receive a high profile in the media.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_047.wav	3.25	They were urged to get themselves in order.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_048.wav	4.01	I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_049.wav	4.31	Here is a tale of devotion to duty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_050.wav	2.91	But don't expect an easy ride.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_051.wav	4.22	In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_052.wav	4.44	Some US embassy staff have left the country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_053.wav	4.27	Her mother said she fell off a swing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_054.wav	4.27	We see little sign of improvement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_055.wav	4.74	The study, carried out by the consumer magazine Which?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_056.wav	4.40	Ten years on, that advice is beginning to pay dividends.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_057.wav	3.71	For example they could be in school uniform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_058.wav	2.95	This film will be totally awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_059.wav	4.61	Three further cases were confirmed yesterday in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_060.wav	4.18	There is no mandate for a regime change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_061.wav	3.46	He did the right thing by ignoring me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_062.wav	2.94	That tells you something about them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_063.wav	3.67	The father was treated like a criminal, and why?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_064.wav	2.43	This rule is archaic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_065.wav	2.61	I am a drug addict.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_066.wav	3.59	I've had to take time off work today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_067.wav	3.55	This wasn't just a big crowd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_068.wav	3.33	I wondered about changing back to rugby.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_069.wav	4.35	Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_070.wav	4.06	However, consumers may take a different view.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_071.wav	3.80	Nancy is not sure how she feels.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_072.wav	3.20	How do you resurrect a dying town?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_073.wav	3.50	I've put my own money into this project.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_074.wav	3.03	I've come here for the jersey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_075.wav	3.03	It's been a terrible ordeal for Margaret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_076.wav	3.29	I'm so proud of my team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_077.wav	5.33	That would open the gates of hell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_078.wav	2.73	This has not, and has been neglected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_079.wav	6.23	Waiting times for these services are too long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_080.wav	4.91	If you're a national company, you must provide it all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_081.wav	4.57	In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_082.wav	4.18	But they must serve their sentence in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_083.wav	2.86	However, it is much bigger than that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_084.wav	4.18	This season has been great for me, it's been an experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_085.wav	2.86	The jury is still out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_086.wav	2.82	He asked me in a tolerance zone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_087.wav	3.89	For now, though, my future is with Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_088.wav	3.41	I drove the ball well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_089.wav	4.82	If so, how does it intend to achieve this result?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_090.wav	3.12	His handling raises a wider issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_091.wav	3.25	This is not a recipe for conflict.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_092.wav	4.14	He had done his homework properly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_093.wav	4.61	You've got it coming Kabul.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_094.wav	3.88	Alan Milburn, the health secretary, refused to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_095.wav	3.80	We will have to see, but it makes you think.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_096.wav	2.99	We must keep our feet on the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_097.wav	3.20	My grandparents were terrified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_098.wav	2.61	Are they control freaks?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_099.wav	3.46	I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_100.wav	3.76	They never looked like winning it either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_101.wav	3.67	The party lasted all night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_102.wav	3.08	No details of the talks were given.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_103.wav	3.46	It is understood they saw one body.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_104.wav	3.33	It was a wilful act of violence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_105.wav	3.67	T, Is there anything in the wound?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_106.wav	4.48	Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_107.wav	4.06	The research is published in the journal, Nature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_108.wav	2.65	She is a double victim.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_109.wav	3.67	They make a selective perception process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_110.wav	4.95	Everything on our programme is brilliant and diverse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_111.wav	3.33	It's the way we go about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_112.wav	2.27	There was an e-mail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_113.wav	3.88	Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_114.wav	5.12	We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_115.wav	3.29	Each day is a new beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_116.wav	2.52	My daughter is an adult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_117.wav	3.88	Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_118.wav	2.91	We've come from a long way back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_119.wav	2.99	A lot of things can go wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_120.wav	3.08	He seemed to lose his focus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_121.wav	1.88	It is a vicious circle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_122.wav	3.25	She was eight months pregnant at the time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_123.wav	3.59	There has been no delay on government orders.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_124.wav	3.93	Women were mostly notable by their absence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_125.wav	3.76	Everyone needs a holiday, even the Salvation Army.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_126.wav	5.12	I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_127.wav	2.35	How do you respond to losing your child?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_128.wav	2.18	Who is the employer?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_129.wav	4.95	This is the biggest thing in the world, isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_130.wav	4.83	McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_131.wav	3.93	On this form, they have a real chance of going up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_132.wav	3.71	Two charges of threatening crew members were dropped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_133.wav	2.48	You can never have enough money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_134.wav	3.33	Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_135.wav	4.10	I COULD hardly keep up with Professor McKean.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_136.wav	3.59	Our plans for Dunfermline have not changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_137.wav	3.63	Paterson can afford to be generous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_138.wav	5.42	Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_139.wav	2.69	They do the work, you know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_140.wav	3.38	Thus far we have received no complaints.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_141.wav	2.95	I haven't made the donation yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_142.wav	2.90	Other people also tried.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_143.wav	3.37	Slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_144.wav	3.33	It would have very little impact on them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_145.wav	3.80	It would still have been a good film, but very different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_146.wav	2.86	My future is in the marathon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_147.wav	4.18	They were even being used by primary pupils.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_148.wav	3.97	This event allows us to emphasise the positive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_149.wav	2.82	They chose to side with terror.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_150.wav	4.87	In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_151.wav	2.35	They just made me feel dizzy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_152.wav	3.33	He must have sat down, relieved it was over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_153.wav	3.85	He will do so today in Monte Carlo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_154.wav	3.25	Health care workers and labourers followed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_155.wav	3.89	Blair also faces pressure from within the cabinet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_156.wav	3.59	Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_157.wav	3.63	We have all been shocked by her death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_158.wav	3.67	We are asking the council to think again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_159.wav	3.20	He had worked there for only two days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_160.wav	2.56	Hopefully, now we're getting it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_161.wav	3.97	But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_162.wav	3.80	For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_163.wav	4.61	They want to shut the Scottish Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_164.wav	4.65	Scotland need to work on two key areas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_165.wav	3.20	We have already begun to do that here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_166.wav	3.24	The home team also had their moments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_167.wav	3.50	They refused to fire on their own countrymen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_168.wav	4.65	In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_169.wav	3.07	That is where the club has gone wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_170.wav	2.95	I got off to a great start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_171.wav	3.03	It is scheduled to go ahead next Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_172.wav	3.16	The actor has met with Mandela.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_173.wav	2.52	Singing has gone out of fashion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_174.wav	3.71	We begin, as ever, with a reminder of the end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_175.wav	2.69	I got on very well with Allan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_176.wav	3.08	That has given me great confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_177.wav	2.65	This is a dream come true for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_178.wav	3.42	He was lying face down in the water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_179.wav	2.52	He urged people to forgive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_180.wav	3.08	So he is open to ideas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_181.wav	3.29	Central to their cause was Barry Nicholson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_182.wav	4.06	Not that anyone has actually suffered, for her art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_183.wav	4.23	We are expected to do better than before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_184.wav	2.31	The attacker died in the crash.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_185.wav	2.95	I am not even thinking about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_186.wav	2.82	Angola was a really hard place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_187.wav	3.08	It is giving out the wrong message.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_188.wav	4.27	It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workmanlike.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_189.wav	3.12	The sleeper was six hours late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_190.wav	3.76	Tax is a matter for national governments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_191.wav	2.60	We want to keep the pound.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_192.wav	4.74	This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_193.wav	3.12	He needed seven hours of surgery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_194.wav	5.89	Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_195.wav	3.07	It just came into my head that day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_196.wav	3.38	Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_197.wav	5.08	They were later released, and last night were staying with relatives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_198.wav	2.99	I am saddened to hear of the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_199.wav	3.12	Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_200.wav	3.16	He would help me with the form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_201.wav	2.91	The actors just have to say so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_202.wav	2.60	The minister is the engineer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_203.wav	2.73	I think it was briefly considered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_204.wav	2.18	It's a hidden problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_205.wav	2.43	I lost a part of me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_206.wav	3.80	Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_207.wav	2.74	It's part of the game, isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_208.wav	2.35	I believe in the Church.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_209.wav	2.86	Others were even less confident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_210.wav	3.50	It will only work with changes in lifestyle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_211.wav	3.20	So people will come out with these things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_212.wav	2.78	You may have a short memory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_213.wav	2.94	My only ambition is to enjoy my work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_214.wav	2.95	The whole thing is utterly transparent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_215.wav	2.99	Every game against New Zealand is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_216.wav	3.20	That doesn't mean the Cabinet has to endorse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_217.wav	2.99	He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_218.wav	3.20	It shows that painting is still relevant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_219.wav	4.99	Then there's one where people play for fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_220.wav	3.20	It may be his last for a while, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_221.wav	3.63	They have enough intrusion at the time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_222.wav	3.76	Then one night only three people turn up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_223.wav	3.12	The parents will have a great time, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_224.wav	4.18	Now we see the impact of global politics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_225.wav	3.84	Borrowing power was one of those improvements.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_226.wav	3.37	Appointments should be made on merit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_227.wav	3.12	There have been a lot of lessons learned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_228.wav	2.99	I think we will join the single currency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_229.wav	2.48	Gilbert was not amused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_230.wav	2.56	Everything was up for grabs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_231.wav	3.59	I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_232.wav	2.82	There will not be any charges.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_233.wav	3.16	Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_234.wav	3.72	Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_235.wav	2.69	I think we have a very strong case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_236.wav	2.73	It should be a great game, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_237.wav	3.67	You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_238.wav	4.40	Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_239.wav	3.50	So the process was refined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_240.wav	4.02	I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_241.wav	3.63	I have been here for only three months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_242.wav	4.01	They were not doing it too well, either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_243.wav	3.33	He added, It's not a racial problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_244.wav	2.95	We hope this scheme will change that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_245.wav	3.24	How could anyone take issue with that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_246.wav	3.46	The decision is an absolute disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_247.wav	3.42	They were at her bedside when she died.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_248.wav	3.55	They had had time for little else.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_249.wav	3.63	We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_250.wav	3.29	In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_251.wav	2.78	She did not attend the courtroom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_252.wav	3.54	In the meantime, he added, prevention was the key.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_253.wav	3.12	The composer therefore believes he can do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_254.wav	2.56	I still feel like a wee boy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_255.wav	4.31	He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_256.wav	2.31	But there was a shift.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_257.wav	3.24	Israel has done very little until now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_258.wav	3.20	Debate was impassioned and furious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_259.wav	2.52	The death rates are still as high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_260.wav	3.67	For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_261.wav	3.08	We certainly will need to watch him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_262.wav	2.48	I don't think it could be clearer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_263.wav	2.74	We can only go up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_264.wav	3.46	He put some colour into Scottish history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_265.wav	2.39	Our offer will remain on the table.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_266.wav	2.65	He is a man who lives to work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_267.wav	2.48	The website is now being amended.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_268.wav	2.31	It's an internal matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_269.wav	2.90	If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_270.wav	3.16	The breakdown was much later in her life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_271.wav	2.52	Whoever said that cannot have seen it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_272.wav	3.12	He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_273.wav	2.65	I hadn't seen them in eight years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_274.wav	2.90	Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_275.wav	3.12	I am now just a bit uneasy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_276.wav	2.99	However, Sharon rejected the claims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_277.wav	2.52	They married in August last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_278.wav	2.95	Yet he chose to do something different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_279.wav	4.10	He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_280.wav	2.65	The case will now go to appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_281.wav	2.56	They really did a great job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_282.wav	3.72	Our nation has been changed by this event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_283.wav	2.56	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_284.wav	2.52	I love you so very much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_285.wav	3.16	The road was closed for several hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_286.wav	5.51	In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_287.wav	3.76	Surrey police said no body had been found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_288.wav	3.29	My aim is a top six finish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_289.wav	4.23	We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_290.wav	3.84	Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_291.wav	2.35	I love the tradition of vaudeville.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_292.wav	2.69	Most of the public are behind me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_293.wav	2.99	It really is a gift to the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_294.wav	2.78	This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_295.wav	3.46	My house was shaking at the time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_296.wav	3.16	I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_297.wav	3.33	This is a very positive step forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_298.wav	3.08	This is a huge confidence boost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_299.wav	2.78	That's how it worked in Bosnia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_300.wav	2.86	Nobody even knew it had happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_301.wav	2.78	She is a very lucky lady.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_302.wav	2.77	We've been there for seven years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_303.wav	3.29	They made a huge impression on me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_304.wav	3.16	His signature is his handwriting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_305.wav	3.24	He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_306.wav	4.10	It also highlighted some local hero districts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_307.wav	3.97	The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_308.wav	3.29	It worked, up to a point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_309.wav	4.19	One season, they might do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_310.wav	4.78	NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_311.wav	3.93	We've got a great defensive club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_312.wav	3.29	It's up to their parents to choose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_313.wav	2.65	I feel privileged to be here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_314.wav	3.03	She told me to apply for the crest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_315.wav	2.69	I think the Government should pay for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_316.wav	3.20	It is still holding good today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_317.wav	3.25	The budget was too low for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_318.wav	3.80	His sister added, We expected him to be jailed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_319.wav	5.25	The airspace above the theatre was closed off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_320.wav	3.89	We cannot rely on protracted legal proceedings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_321.wav	2.99	I know the worry over Iraq.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_322.wav	2.69	I just could not cope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_323.wav	3.89	We didn't know he was even out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_324.wav	4.82	Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_325.wav	3.93	Here are some possible solutions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_326.wav	3.33	He made so many bad decisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_327.wav	5.47	We are now up against it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_328.wav	4.66	It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_329.wav	3.50	I would have dropped out otherwise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_330.wav	4.23	Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_331.wav	4.36	They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_332.wav	4.01	I think he has undergone a sea change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_333.wav	2.39	One must hope not!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_334.wav	4.82	The casting of her husband was an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_335.wav	4.57	From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_336.wav	4.19	That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_337.wav	3.08	That's what it's all about, isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_338.wav	4.31	When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_339.wav	2.90	This time, there were no such rewards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_340.wav	3.67	Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_341.wav	2.56	I'm just doing artwork.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_342.wav	3.76	And we still have to pay his salary.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_343.wav	2.99	Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_344.wav	2.90	So there's a double whammy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_345.wav	2.26	I didn't have a trio.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_346.wav	4.52	Their three other children had died as infants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_347.wav	3.37	We knew nothing about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_348.wav	2.86	I am astonished by this decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_349.wav	2.18	I hope my successor will do the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_350.wav	3.29	We have got a full house tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_351.wav	2.61	Our children are our future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_352.wav	2.61	We will see how he is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_353.wav	2.48	The fans will support us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_354.wav	2.99	It was a long process, but we got there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_355.wav	3.55	It has, however, been a long time coming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_356.wav	2.14	The whole team was rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_357.wav	2.31	Now we need to keep our heads up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_358.wav	2.73	I put the drawing down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_359.wav	2.82	They feel it belongs to them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_360.wav	3.16	They must act now to tighten the rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_361.wav	2.86	They too refused to come out and talk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_362.wav	2.77	It gave me something to focus on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_363.wav	3.16	It's the curse of our time, irony.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_364.wav	2.65	It's a source of deep concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_365.wav	3.80	Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_366.wav	3.59	But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_367.wav	3.93	Last month he made his debut in Japan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_368.wav	2.56	The Dow Jones is way up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_369.wav	3.03	Now there is an even bigger target.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_370.wav	2.31	There has been a big change in defence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_371.wav	2.95	The Treasury confirmed that the latter was correct.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_372.wav	2.56	There is nothing like a fresh start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_373.wav	3.08	The company has other problems with the shells.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_374.wav	2.43	This must have been severe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_375.wav	2.69	We're all in a state of shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_376.wav	2.65	I thought he was part of the camera.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_377.wav	3.50	Farmers have been an endangered species.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_378.wav	4.06	Injury has played a part, but not a big one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_379.wav	3.12	Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_380.wav	2.65	He was released in March this year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_381.wav	3.07	The Chosen One doesn't always excel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_382.wav	3.12	Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_383.wav	2.86	We're not an employment agency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_384.wav	3.42	People might not actually want the job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_385.wav	2.95	The court had a number of empty seats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_386.wav	4.23	It is the logical extension of audio description.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_387.wav	2.35	It broke up my marriage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_388.wav	3.59	Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_389.wav	3.33	He also was in debt to drug dealers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_390.wav	3.88	The package has been properly costed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_391.wav	4.05	This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_392.wav	2.61	The love affair was over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_393.wav	3.20	For some, it was more painful than others.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_394.wav	5.85	John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_395.wav	2.90	I can't stop people thinking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_396.wav	6.57	The workers said they were treated like animals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_397.wav	4.61	She had every right to read the warrant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_398.wav	3.12	Several people were out in the street.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_399.wav	2.95	There is too much at stake for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_400.wav	3.16	A review group will report on Tuesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_401.wav	3.12	In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_402.wav	2.69	The place became a war zone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_403.wav	1.88	It is not an abortion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_404.wav	3.63	It was to get even better for Motherwell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_405.wav	3.76	The surprise is its product is so poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_406.wav	3.12	Thus the story will continue to thrive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_407.wav	2.05	See it while you can.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_408.wav	2.90	I didn't do too badly myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_409.wav	3.84	Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_410.wav	2.39	He has never even been to Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_411.wav	3.16	We believe the squad will stay together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_412.wav	2.65	Such people do not exist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_413.wav	2.69	We suspect he was pleased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_414.wav	4.01	It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_415.wav	3.12	She always wanted her own way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_416.wav	2.01	But it is all by design.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_417.wav	2.35	We've still got a say in this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_418.wav	3.76	She can't say where she was, what she did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_419.wav	2.18	I'll take what comes along.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_420.wav	2.48	Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_421.wav	2.39	Women reported more depression than men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_422.wav	3.29	The euro is your money, it is our money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p305\p305_423.wav	0.30	Nothing has been going for us, but what can you do?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_001.wav	2.48	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_002.wav	4.95	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_003.wav	9.13	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_004.wav	6.92	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_005.wav	9.00	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_006.wav	6.74	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_007.wav	5.59	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_008.wav	11.69	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its paths high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_009.wav	6.44	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_010.wav	4.91	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_011.wav	9.52	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_012.wav	6.87	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_013.wav	6.96	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_014.wav	7.94	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_015.wav	8.11	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_016.wav	8.84	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_017.wav	8.58	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_018.wav	7.53	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_019.wav	10.46	Since then physicists have found that is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_020.wav	6.32	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_021.wav	13.06	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_022.wav	10.46	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_023.wav	15.24	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_024.wav	9.45	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_025.wav	6.83	Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_026.wav	4.36	This is not a floating Las Vegas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_027.wav	3.37	This is not an amnesty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_028.wav	6.28	The important thing was to be there, and to experience it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_029.wav	4.74	Of course, this is nice to hear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_030.wav	5.93	It was between myself, the management, and the team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_031.wav	4.44	I don't believe you own anything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_032.wav	4.61	The music industry hasn't changed at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_033.wav	5.98	There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_034.wav	4.01	Blood samples have been taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_035.wav	5.25	Someone came down and said, Can you read a script?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_036.wav	6.32	He said he now intends to fly today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_037.wav	5.12	This means that our programme is quite unusual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_038.wav	5.47	Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_039.wav	5.72	A further police inquiry is currently being held.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_040.wav	5.21	Some people begin to turn away, to go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_041.wav	4.86	You're not stopping people using sunbeds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_042.wav	4.87	A recording contract is on the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_043.wav	4.87	It has been a horrible, horrible time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_044.wav	3.84	We like being the underdogs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_045.wav	4.65	They said construction work could begin within weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_046.wav	4.82	We will continue to operate within the sport.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_047.wav	4.05	But the law is very clear on this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_048.wav	4.95	But all forms of the illness are treatable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_049.wav	4.83	It is also central to the unfolding drama.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_050.wav	4.48	Except for this, it was offside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_051.wav	5.89	On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_052.wav	3.12	It's a grey area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_053.wav	3.33	Retirement, who knows?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_054.wav	4.23	He was shocked by what he saw.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_055.wav	6.66	Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_056.wav	3.63	It comes on like a tidal wave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_057.wav	5.17	England and Wales are likely to pull out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_058.wav	7.16	Mr Cook, a left-winger from Britain, would be ideally replaced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_059.wav	5.29	He was taken ill in December last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_060.wav	4.70	We welcome the decisions of Mr Byers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_061.wav	5.51	It's all too short term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_062.wav	5.34	This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_063.wav	6.40	Meanwhile, the weather was causing widespread disruption.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_064.wav	4.48	Robin Williams is very subdued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_065.wav	4.27	His rival's are spoken with elan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_066.wav	6.79	He also does not get on with Christina.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_067.wav	4.48	If convicted, they face the death penalty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_068.wav	5.25	How things have changed since then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_069.wav	7.04	Therefore, it isn't getting the respect it deserves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_070.wav	3.76	This is the way things should be handled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_071.wav	6.19	For me, the tour is wide open this year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_072.wav	6.32	In the past few years, they have started to fight back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_073.wav	3.89	The Prime Minister was very honest and sincere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_074.wav	7.45	What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_075.wav	5.89	She opens tonight in Glasgow, at the King's Theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_076.wav	4.44	Henman is taking nothing for granted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_077.wav	3.88	You'd think there was a match on today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_078.wav	3.33	We must move on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_079.wav	4.52	Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_080.wav	4.78	The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_081.wav	3.97	His options are severely limited.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_082.wav	4.23	It is truly fields of miracles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_083.wav	4.35	They are not an item.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_084.wav	3.72	Why did they let him go?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_085.wav	4.61	Another suggestion was dismissed by Virgin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_086.wav	3.42	I have made good progress.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_087.wav	3.21	We do need a new one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_088.wav	4.44	They had to be cut from the wreckage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_089.wav	6.09	We defended well, but couldn't do much in attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_090.wav	5.17	What happens when the funding is exhausted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_091.wav	4.61	He then had a swipe at Hearts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_092.wav	5.51	According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_093.wav	4.44	But the relief was short-lived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_094.wav	3.80	You had better believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_095.wav	3.03	The mood is upbeat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_096.wav	3.37	They told us about it the next day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_097.wav	4.08	It's not a new concept in jazz.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_098.wav	4.01	There are a huge number of arts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_099.wav	5.93	They are, therefore, not in favour of dispersal of sex offenders.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_100.wav	4.07	My office is bare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_101.wav	6.10	Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_102.wav	6.40	Where is the anthrax?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_103.wav	5.04	Housing is in very short supply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_104.wav	3.80	After all, he is the King of Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_105.wav	6.49	People just came on their own.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_106.wav	6.23	We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_107.wav	5.46	The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_108.wav	5.30	You either have him or you don't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_109.wav	5.63	There are some new buildings in there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_110.wav	5.51	I am prepared to step down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_111.wav	6.10	I'm not a diva.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_112.wav	7.13	There is great relief at this point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_113.wav	5.16	Look at them after three days of rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_114.wav	2.56	I didn't realise it had reached that stage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_115.wav	3.80	There is no point in pushing it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_116.wav	5.08	He was the deputy editor at the paper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_117.wav	4.87	Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_118.wav	6.27	Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_119.wav	7.56	Completion is expected by October the following year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_120.wav	6.36	However, it very nearly all went wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_121.wav	4.61	It is not a definite proposal as yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_122.wav	5.17	I will speak to Michael about this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_123.wav	6.32	This is not understood by people outside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_124.wav	5.63	I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_125.wav	3.63	Wallace was a prisoner of war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_126.wav	3.08	There is a lack of chemistry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_127.wav	3.03	I went straight to the toilet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_128.wav	5.93	She says the royal family get on well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_129.wav	3.67	Does a firefighter have to be killed?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_130.wav	5.59	Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_131.wav	4.78	That group reported just before Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_132.wav	4.27	I've always been desperate to play this part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_133.wav	3.76	We haven't actually considered it down here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_134.wav	6.41	There is still much work to be done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_135.wav	6.53	However, details have yet to be worked out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_136.wav	6.10	All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_137.wav	7.51	One of them, a woman, is in serious condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_138.wav	5.54	We were with him the whole time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_139.wav	5.08	From then on, Scott has never looked back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_140.wav	1.33	All manner of precaution and protection are taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_141.wav	3.67	That's because we work hard at it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_142.wav	6.15	This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_143.wav	7.68	He's been the key to everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_144.wav	4.99	Since then, my life has been turned upside down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_145.wav	4.57	Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_146.wav	5.38	They said to me, Why don't you get into acting, Tommy?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_147.wav	5.17	We need a new kind of theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_148.wav	1.97	I was in the train station overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_149.wav	7.68	I feel my life to be at risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_150.wav	2.52	Again and again, at every level, he delivered the goods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_151.wav	0.86	That would be poetic, wouldn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_152.wav	10.33	We came across the first set of bodies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_153.wav	3.63	We need some confidence to get a win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_154.wav	4.53	Does that put pressure on us?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_155.wav	4.78	You've seen the polls then, Sean.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_156.wav	4.78	This is a foolish idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_157.wav	3.67	You might even have seen him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_158.wav	6.36	Sussex Police refused to give any further details.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_159.wav	5.16	They thought they had found a home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_160.wav	5.55	She collapsed and died a day later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_161.wav	5.04	You should be there with six different characters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_162.wav	4.95	Laura is an investment banker.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_163.wav	3.97	I took a minibus into town.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_164.wav	3.63	I do my job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_165.wav	4.10	Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_166.wav	5.81	Running costs are not subsidised by public money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_167.wav	5.51	Where are his symphonies and major concertos?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_168.wav	3.84	Four policemen were wounded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_169.wav	4.35	Who do these people think they are?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_171.wav	6.15	We want to help them through it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_172.wav	5.76	It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_173.wav	5.27	It has been recorded twice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_174.wav	4.61	It was a bit like having children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_175.wav	3.93	You cannot eat in the dining room.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_176.wav	4.58	It's very difficult to find a buyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_177.wav	4.82	It shows that we are a civilised society.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_178.wav	6.36	It's a commission, and for it's work, a year's work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_179.wav	4.87	I came home by ambulance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_180.wav	4.99	You will never forget the clutching horror.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_181.wav	5.00	It was extremely foolish behaviour on your part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_182.wav	5.21	She is living proof of their expertise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_183.wav	4.25	This one was my best chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_184.wav	4.66	We believe a third party was involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_185.wav	3.63	I am writing a novel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_186.wav	5.46	A bit of match fitness is required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_187.wav	5.21	All were paid by the taxpayer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_188.wav	5.00	The faith of large numbers remain unknown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_189.wav	4.88	It was located on the remote control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_190.wav	5.76	The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_191.wav	4.27	Twaddle is a case in point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_192.wav	3.76	These elements are in the book.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_193.wav	3.71	You look at them and you understand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_194.wav	3.97	I am considered a teenager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_195.wav	4.10	I would like Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_196.wav	4.35	The FBI could become involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_197.wav	3.72	We have only nine months to go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_198.wav	4.05	Both of them have looked good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_199.wav	4.27	I like footballers who play well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_201.wav	7.30	The talking is going on, but the Iraqi people will survive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_202.wav	4.83	Well that's very New Labour, isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_203.wav	4.42	It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_204.wav	4.52	Donald was a man with many friends.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_205.wav	3.71	We played them off the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_206.wav	4.99	It was turning that way all across Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_207.wav	6.57	Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_208.wav	4.86	We were on top and could have won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_209.wav	4.02	That night was a terrible muddle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_210.wav	4.78	The next time he saw her, she was a different person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_211.wav	4.10	He ended up a headmaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_212.wav	4.61	He was too good for me - too consistent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_213.wav	4.06	It is like being a qualifier again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_214.wav	7.04	David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_215.wav	4.91	If we live forever, can we be said to live?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_216.wav	7.51	Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_217.wav	4.44	I told you, you were doing it all wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_218.wav	4.57	Roy Keane is certainly the best.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_219.wav	4.91	I might get an injury very easily.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_220.wav	5.21	There are a lot of unanswered questions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_221.wav	5.59	A world away from Rangers, you might say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_222.wav	4.74	It was a stunning drive from Jon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_223.wav	3.72	She didn't tell us anything new.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_224.wav	3.93	There is nothing like this back home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_225.wav	4.74	And that gives a kind of freedom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_226.wav	4.78	I found a fault and worked at it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_227.wav	4.53	It was a poor performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_228.wav	5.85	They may yet have the last laugh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_229.wav	4.14	You can feel at home in China.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_230.wav	5.76	This is all part of being opening the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_231.wav	4.87	We have tried to keep his head up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_232.wav	6.27	For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_233.wav	3.89	He will become the sovereign.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_234.wav	5.42	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_235.wav	1.75	Everyone could see it apart from Kevin Keegan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_236.wav	5.38	The success story shows no signs of stopping.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_237.wav	4.87	This is a huge boost for my confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_238.wav	5.12	It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_239.wav	4.01	It's just gotten too big.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_240.wav	4.65	Was all this really just five months ago?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_241.wav	6.70	The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_242.wav	5.34	They were two different types.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_243.wav	5.08	It need not be like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_244.wav	6.15	At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_245.wav	6.49	Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_246.wav	4.70	Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_247.wav	5.51	The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_248.wav	6.96	However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_249.wav	8.79	He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_250.wav	6.66	Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_251.wav	5.38	I am totally horrified by the sentence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_252.wav	6.91	I just saw them for a few minutes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_253.wav	6.49	A management agreement, however, was conceded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_254.wav	5.98	People would say, He thinks he can do that as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_255.wav	5.38	The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_256.wav	4.99	Our objective is to tackle poverty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_257.wav	3.89	Two things will count for us in Brussels.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_258.wav	4.18	Today's meeting was open and friendly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_259.wav	4.40	It's the stop-gap before extinction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_260.wav	4.48	He must have something up his sleeve.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_261.wav	4.44	If it wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_262.wav	4.91	They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_263.wav	6.06	That means no more taxation by stealth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_264.wav	4.61	History may repeat itself with Billy Elliot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_265.wav	4.57	Holland won by five wickets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_266.wav	6.53	His expulsion would not solve the problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_267.wav	8.88	After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_268.wav	5.08	Once they go away they won't come back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_269.wav	5.34	THE best marriages are made in heaven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_270.wav	3.76	The main thing is that they enjoy it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_272.wav	6.45	We have to sort it out ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_273.wav	4.52	The board has rejected her proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_274.wav	5.64	It does not move, which is amazing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_275.wav	4.74	She is a very lucky young lady.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_276.wav	4.45	The threat to rural areas is real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_277.wav	5.72	Tourism continues to struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_278.wav	7.79	That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_279.wav	5.76	But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_281.wav	4.14	This is a great shame.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_282.wav	5.04	That was merely their initial problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_283.wav	6.41	I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_284.wav	6.87	We said, What do you mean?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_285.wav	6.87	I need them to set my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_286.wav	5.55	The law will take its course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_287.wav	6.57	They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_288.wav	5.34	It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_289.wav	3.97	The fund has three elements.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_290.wav	3.76	This is a young team, you know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_291.wav	3.88	It's not even finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_292.wav	4.49	Everyone knew where they were.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_293.wav	6.70	As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminister Hall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_294.wav	4.87	In the old days, it was easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_295.wav	5.21	People will make up their own minds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_296.wav	4.14	After that he became more romantic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_297.wav	6.23	There is bound to be a formal complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_298.wav	5.21	My view has now completely changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_299.wav	4.36	They finished second and third.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_300.wav	3.54	We agreed to disagree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_301.wav	4.44	He was then replaced by Ross.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_302.wav	6.70	It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_303.wav	6.87	I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_304.wav	5.25	We've always had three options, and none of them perfect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_305.wav	5.76	People can get them if they want.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_306.wav	4.02	Their message was simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_307.wav	5.51	They're currently managed by Ian Wilson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_308.wav	4.48	He is a law unto himself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_309.wav	4.82	With him are the symbols of his faith.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_310.wav	5.04	There are no easy solutions to this problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_311.wav	6.23	An aide was instructed to get a copy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_312.wav	4.48	The Allies intend to maintain the average.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_313.wav	5.34	Part of Johnny was found some days after.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_314.wav	4.06	It was just completely erased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_315.wav	4.48	A great deal has been achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_316.wav	4.48	I've been thinking about it for a year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_317.wav	5.25	I enjoy playing with both of them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_318.wav	4.48	Too often it is not.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_319.wav	3.67	I tend to not look back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_320.wav	4.48	Confidence among the allies began to slip.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_321.wav	3.25	I got a yellow card.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_322.wav	6.66	Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_323.wav	4.78	I didn't know what he was capable of.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_324.wav	5.68	Our place as artists is to ask questions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_325.wav	6.11	It's good to start with Judith.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_326.wav	6.14	She is now on the back benches.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_327.wav	5.89	It may also be her last.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_328.wav	5.00	Maybe it helps us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_329.wav	3.33	Three bystanders were killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_330.wav	6.19	We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_331.wav	5.47	However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_332.wav	3.54	He made no big mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_333.wav	5.72	There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_334.wav	4.86	We will be homeless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_335.wav	4.10	I believe he can do a better job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_336.wav	6.87	Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_337.wav	5.93	Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_338.wav	5.04	That decision was applauded by Williamson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_339.wav	4.40	But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_340.wav	3.20	Well, was it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_341.wav	3.20	We won't let you down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_342.wav	3.37	What kind of person is he?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_343.wav	4.91	Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_344.wav	5.00	He was visited by UK consular officials.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_345.wav	6.36	So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_346.wav	6.15	English is the language of pop music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_347.wav	5.93	The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_348.wav	5.55	It is a simple equation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_349.wav	5.16	She has seen, or heard, it all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_351.wav	7.17	This time, however, there is a new venue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_352.wav	2.04	Who has the second highest?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_354.wav	5.93	You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_355.wav	7.38	I didn't even have the first idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_356.wav	3.16	No person was charged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_357.wav	3.67	I've only met him three times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_358.wav	3.89	You see, my back has gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_359.wav	4.01	It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p306\p306_360.wav	4.27	She looked very, very poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_001.wav	2.82	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_002.wav	6.06	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_003.wav	7.94	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_005.wav	7.94	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_006.wav	6.40	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_007.wav	6.15	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_008.wav	9.86	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_009.wav	6.57	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_010.wav	4.65	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_011.wav	8.28	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_012.wav	5.98	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_013.wav	5.93	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_014.wav	6.28	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_015.wav	8.02	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_016.wav	8.58	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_017.wav	5.16	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_018.wav	7.64	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_019.wav	8.84	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_020.wav	5.64	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_021.wav	10.84	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_022.wav	8.32	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_023.wav	13.14	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_024.wav	8.49	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_025.wav	4.87	But it was a great decision he joked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_026.wav	4.53	They changed the world of music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_027.wav	5.00	You need a long-term strategy in football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_028.wav	4.78	The law has got to be upheld.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_029.wav	4.48	But we're not the same person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_030.wav	5.00	He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_031.wav	3.76	I saw the explosion and panicked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_032.wav	4.48	The punishment was swift.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_033.wav	6.02	However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_034.wav	5.25	I kept my side of the bargain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_035.wav	5.42	It also makes for interesting viewing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_036.wav	6.40	Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_037.wav	5.34	He released a half-dozen solo albums.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_038.wav	4.95	That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_039.wav	5.34	There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_040.wav	5.55	Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_041.wav	4.10	It doesn't make them evil.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_042.wav	3.76	I have played really well all year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_043.wav	4.95	Parts of the system are already overstretched.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_044.wav	5.59	Tourism in Scotland is facing a financial disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_045.wav	5.59	It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_046.wav	5.81	She added, It is the same story in both countries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_047.wav	5.12	Lara is very, very much a girl.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_048.wav	4.44	I try not to expect anything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_049.wav	4.65	Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_050.wav	4.57	There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_051.wav	4.44	It was, however, the wrong side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_052.wav	3.84	She is now planning a visit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_053.wav	5.46	It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_054.wav	5.34	Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_055.wav	4.87	Today, we begin to answer that question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_056.wav	5.16	No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_057.wav	3.12	I keep my fingers crossed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_058.wav	3.93	The encounter was to change his life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_059.wav	3.08	It's the best of both worlds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_060.wav	5.59	They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_061.wav	4.57	That is why we want this decision reversed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_062.wav	6.19	It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_063.wav	4.95	Staff were invited to make their own proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_064.wav	5.76	We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_065.wav	7.30	After this, the exercise was due to begin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_066.wav	7.38	And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_067.wav	4.91	I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_068.wav	6.14	CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_069.wav	4.23	I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_070.wav	5.38	When he took over it really took off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_071.wav	4.40	That's just the way the game is evolving.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_072.wav	4.48	Michael is putting on a brave face.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_073.wav	5.25	Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_074.wav	4.87	The next thing will be cutting journey times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_075.wav	5.25	It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_076.wav	5.08	This is a mental challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_077.wav	4.10	Their one weakness was running between the wickets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_078.wav	4.61	He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_079.wav	5.68	Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_080.wav	4.36	Ferguson did not hesitate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_081.wav	3.50	He came in an army uniform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_082.wav	6.27	However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_083.wav	4.57	Cars are great for going long distances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_084.wav	5.38	It was published yesterday on the internet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_085.wav	4.44	I knew he would play two weeks ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_086.wav	6.36	The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_087.wav	3.37	It has never been worthwhile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_088.wav	4.44	So other options had to be explored.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_089.wav	5.29	He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_090.wav	5.59	We will learn lessons from what has happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_091.wav	4.78	People love to see this stuff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_092.wav	5.89	One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_093.wav	5.08	Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_094.wav	5.21	His female companion was being treated for shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_095.wav	4.44	I have no plans to change the oath.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_096.wav	4.10	We did not even get a free kick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_097.wav	4.02	He was married with a young child.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_098.wav	6.02	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_099.wav	5.51	Anyone remaining after that will be targeted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_100.wav	4.61	They serve a multitude of purposes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_101.wav	4.18	But his attendance is not guaranteed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_102.wav	5.42	I am sure all schools would accept that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_103.wav	3.76	I am very sorry to be here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_104.wav	4.57	I needed a change, a new challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_105.wav	4.48	Is your life a little too easy?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_106.wav	4.78	I think my game is suited to grass.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_107.wav	4.19	The little boy was playing football at lunchtime.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_108.wav	4.74	Industry leaders reacted angrily.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_109.wav	4.31	Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_110.wav	4.82	People want to see me on the screen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_111.wav	7.34	The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_112.wav	5.25	And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_113.wav	5.47	The conversion didn't go over either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_114.wav	3.88	He took away my childhood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_115.wav	5.04	They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_116.wav	4.44	The motive for the shooting was not known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_117.wav	6.11	Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_118.wav	6.02	Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_119.wav	4.14	It is not great art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_120.wav	4.70	You do not change overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_121.wav	6.19	The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_122.wav	7.68	One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_123.wav	7.13	Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_124.wav	5.85	We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_125.wav	4.66	We aim to put them out of business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_126.wav	4.95	Tony Blair should get out more.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_127.wav	7.94	We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_128.wav	3.76	He was just awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_129.wav	4.82	We now have to concentrate on the league.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_130.wav	4.18	We need to move forward together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_131.wav	4.65	She died in hospital two hours later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_132.wav	5.38	She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_133.wav	4.27	Both were later released after a check-up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_134.wav	6.36	No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_135.wav	4.99	How good is Lennox Lewis?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_136.wav	5.42	I would ask the fans to be patient.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_137.wav	5.63	The ethos of the school was outstanding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_138.wav	5.46	The son has autism and other problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_139.wav	5.08	I'm very puzzled by it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_140.wav	4.65	Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_141.wav	5.63	Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_142.wav	5.34	We are both very confused and extremely angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_143.wav	4.40	All things are possible if you believe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_144.wav	5.38	This was not just incongruous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_145.wav	4.57	It is patently true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_146.wav	4.27	You hope he prevails.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_147.wav	5.98	And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_148.wav	6.32	The fellowship is much more than a commission, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_149.wav	5.68	What the Department of Transport will make clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_150.wav	4.86	But it looks good for next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_151.wav	7.64	I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_152.wav	5.55	He is wanted by German police for questioning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_153.wav	3.67	He was forced to quit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_154.wav	4.10	It is good for their eyesight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_155.wav	3.97	I was loving that little girl.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_156.wav	4.74	But you can't have it both ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_157.wav	7.13	We don't just play golf in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_158.wav	5.04	That's why the young musicians have joined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_159.wav	5.59	The death toll included five children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_160.wav	4.48	Before the game we went for a pint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_161.wav	5.81	There is no credible official announcement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_162.wav	5.21	I understand the medical concerns.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_163.wav	5.29	This is a United Kingdom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_164.wav	4.95	I thought it was a fantastic game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_165.wav	4.40	I'm aware that somebody made a threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_166.wav	5.51	However, who could have predicted this result?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_167.wav	6.87	Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_168.wav	5.38	As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_169.wav	4.69	They were behind the wheel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_170.wav	5.68	The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_171.wav	5.63	The problem arises because he does so much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_172.wav	4.31	The answer is mayhem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_173.wav	4.27	Our young people are leaving.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_174.wav	4.74	What, then, is the real thing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_175.wav	4.36	I can't believe anyone would agree with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_176.wav	4.95	That will be the sweetness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_177.wav	4.87	But is it ethical to practice in humans?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_178.wav	4.74	The big issue for us is the review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_179.wav	4.61	There was a fossil on screen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_180.wav	6.19	I always loved the lightning in the movies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_181.wav	5.64	This does not create any precedent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_182.wav	5.30	I see social work as a vocation, a commitment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_183.wav	4.65	It has removed a bit of guilt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_184.wav	5.51	I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_185.wav	4.31	You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_186.wav	4.36	The early evidence suggests he did not.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_187.wav	4.87	Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_188.wav	3.20	I hope you miss the cut.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_189.wav	4.48	The role was perfect for Russell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_190.wav	5.80	Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_191.wav	5.46	We are seeking funds from government departments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_192.wav	4.95	That, though, was again according to the manager McCall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_193.wav	6.10	He scored one goal and was on fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_194.wav	5.25	I hate to say it, but you can understand it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_195.wav	4.53	Harold is a rarity.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_196.wav	4.78	Walk out the door and anything can happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_197.wav	5.42	I want him to take on Gomez.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_198.wav	7.34	Her condition last night was described as critical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_199.wav	4.83	Frankly, it was worth the booking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_200.wav	5.00	They tend to be easily influenced by others.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_201.wav	3.93	Well, what do you know?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_202.wav	5.47	There are some serious ethical issues involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_203.wav	5.25	If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_204.wav	5.55	Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_205.wav	4.18	He will emerge as a world leader.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_206.wav	4.78	It opens the door to the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_207.wav	6.19	It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_208.wav	3.63	We have no choice but to shut down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_209.wav	4.06	The prognosis is excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_210.wav	5.04	They always want to give a performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_211.wav	4.27	But he just carried on anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_212.wav	4.65	Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_213.wav	4.69	I would not want to be young again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_214.wav	6.40	Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_215.wav	5.12	The Yugoslav army will still be there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_216.wav	4.14	There are schoolboys in uniform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_217.wav	4.99	They were later discharged from hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_218.wav	4.99	These findings would be made public.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_219.wav	4.01	What are you not good at?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_220.wav	5.21	All the lads are totally focused on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_221.wav	5.47	He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_222.wav	3.88	This makes no sense!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_223.wav	3.67	I go home only once.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_224.wav	4.53	It had a gigantic effect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_225.wav	5.68	I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_226.wav	4.78	If not, a deal could take many months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_227.wav	4.91	The team this year is going places.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_228.wav	5.85	More money for students would help - in an ideal world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_229.wav	4.14	It took more than two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_230.wav	7.00	Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_231.wav	4.57	He said because people had invited him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_232.wav	4.65	That's the key issue isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_233.wav	5.08	Its workforce is to be made redundant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_234.wav	3.84	Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_235.wav	4.61	Correction, knowing him, he might.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_236.wav	3.46	I came up through the ranks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_237.wav	4.70	Why does she suddenly win everything now?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_238.wav	5.55	We wanted it left for a wee while.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_239.wav	4.23	These guys will not lie down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_240.wav	5.68	The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_241.wav	4.83	That is nearly four people every day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_242.wav	4.52	There are nine people here now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_243.wav	4.27	His son is a local legend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_244.wav	6.36	Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_245.wav	5.04	Which perhaps is just as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_246.wav	5.12	It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_247.wav	4.44	He would just say it was terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_248.wav	3.75	This is the New Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_249.wav	4.65	I saw military vehicles in the distance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_250.wav	4.74	I hope it has helped the prisoners.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_251.wav	5.04	We kept going right to the final whistle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_252.wav	4.57	For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_253.wav	8.03	JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_254.wav	4.23	The final stage is paranoia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_255.wav	4.87	I am not holding the club to ransom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_256.wav	4.44	Wanger was never like this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_257.wav	5.46	Pig farmers are completely despondent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_258.wav	4.95	But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_259.wav	5.42	We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_260.wav	3.80	That's the sort of game you want.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_261.wav	3.67	We're not travel agents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_262.wav	5.38	Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_263.wav	4.87	We are trying to clarify the issues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_264.wav	3.25	It's the same old story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_265.wav	3.71	He was telling me to keep quiet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_266.wav	3.63	It was a moment of madness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_267.wav	4.87	I do not own the vessel in question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_268.wav	4.95	Racism has no place in any sport.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_269.wav	5.12	I am not happy with proposals for widows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_270.wav	5.12	It is believed she had serious head injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_271.wav	4.10	Bombing is the easy option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_272.wav	5.29	Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_273.wav	5.08	We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_274.wav	4.70	The pilot was making a visual approach.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_275.wav	4.19	I'd say we should give it a week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_276.wav	5.29	Many other Scottish locations also feature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_277.wav	6.41	Little Voice is on general release.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_278.wav	4.61	That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_279.wav	3.97	There is no substitute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_280.wav	4.44	That nation is South Africa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_281.wav	4.61	This will secure the future of our industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_282.wav	5.59	The police have an awful lot to explain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_283.wav	5.68	Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_284.wav	4.53	That's when you hope to take advantage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_285.wav	3.93	It was an empowering journey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_286.wav	4.69	The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_287.wav	4.66	It's not unlike the millennium bug.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_288.wav	5.04	They had been together for about three years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_289.wav	5.33	Children are using books in a terrible condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_290.wav	4.40	Everything has been destroyed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_291.wav	6.66	The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_292.wav	5.38	He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_293.wav	4.87	We just want to get stuck in now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_294.wav	4.78	Do you come from Moscow?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_295.wav	6.19	Broomfield was the centre of the town.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_296.wav	5.29	He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_297.wav	5.08	They are the innocent victims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_298.wav	5.59	We are aware of the tribunal case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_299.wav	5.63	That is the first job of the director - leadership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_300.wav	5.98	Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_301.wav	5.59	But he was a full, working member of our staff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_302.wav	4.19	Broke the birdie record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_303.wav	5.55	Either group is living in fantasy land.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_304.wav	4.31	They tried to give her advice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_305.wav	6.02	That it is a brand name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_306.wav	5.55	We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_307.wav	5.59	Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_308.wav	5.81	They will have to make changes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_309.wav	6.79	This fact is supported by audience research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_310.wav	8.37	Of further privacy, he had no need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_311.wav	4.91	Both sides have to step back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_312.wav	5.51	Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_313.wav	4.69	They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_314.wav	5.29	It sounds a bit of an own goal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_315.wav	5.25	We are ready for the long haul.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_316.wav	5.55	We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_317.wav	5.29	I look for dancers who are also actors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_318.wav	6.70	However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_319.wav	6.14	EMI is a prime example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_320.wav	5.59	I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_321.wav	4.78	The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_322.wav	4.61	It's a record label, not a form of music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_323.wav	4.40	Not that Agassi was a believer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_324.wav	3.76	A friendship that will endure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_325.wav	4.65	Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_326.wav	5.00	It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_327.wav	4.74	Nowadays, it is workers united.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_328.wav	4.06	He is young but not too young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_329.wav	6.70	I played well on Saturday and again today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_330.wav	4.99	It will also take evidence from consumers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_331.wav	5.12	He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_332.wav	3.63	I am not obsessed with sex.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_333.wav	3.63	They've been at it for five hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_334.wav	3.67	There is no answer to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_335.wav	5.00	There was no let-up for the minnows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_336.wav	4.44	Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_337.wav	4.40	His English counterpart agreed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_338.wav	5.34	It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_339.wav	5.08	He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_340.wav	4.31	Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_341.wav	3.63	I am not putting myself down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_342.wav	3.33	He's a joy to follow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_343.wav	3.88	Bob Dylan is getting old.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_344.wav	3.72	We were lucky to have survived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_345.wav	5.38	Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_346.wav	4.95	At this level, you have all to perform well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_347.wav	4.27	I just want to change my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_348.wav	4.35	He did not oppose the divorce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_349.wav	5.51	Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_350.wav	3.33	And Michael was just great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_351.wav	3.58	He knew it would cost him millions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_352.wav	4.87	Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_353.wav	4.18	Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_354.wav	5.38	Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_355.wav	5.13	That only came out during a radio interview.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_356.wav	4.44	We are now setting about finding them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_357.wav	4.44	They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_358.wav	4.40	We must not go down that road.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_359.wav	4.61	It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_360.wav	4.05	I am not among its admirers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_361.wav	4.02	And that match was played in June.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_362.wav	4.06	He will address the nation this evening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_363.wav	4.83	They have shown a great desire and attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_364.wav	4.14	I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_365.wav	5.34	Motherwell have no such good fortune.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_366.wav	5.08	But he is revelling in the big stage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_367.wav	4.61	Stock markets will be watching closely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_368.wav	5.46	If they have City backing, what is the influence?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_369.wav	6.40	Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_370.wav	5.55	Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_371.wav	5.00	There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_372.wav	3.76	His job was not advertised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_373.wav	4.40	And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_374.wav	4.52	Scottish life can be like this, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_375.wav	4.70	He has changed my life for ever.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_376.wav	4.83	The home was now under new management.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_377.wav	5.46	It is like a theatre of the absurd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_378.wav	3.72	There is no openness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_379.wav	4.57	It's being very carefully looked at.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_380.wav	3.84	It was a job he loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_381.wav	4.74	It may encourage more people to prospect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_382.wav	6.66	Filtering through this material a composite finale emerges.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_383.wav	5.89	Where was their passion, the power, the feeling?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_384.wav	3.25	It looks like paradise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_386.wav	4.10	We were short of athletes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_387.wav	4.74	They want to avoid a flashpoint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_388.wav	6.83	They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_389.wav	4.78	The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_390.wav	6.78	Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_391.wav	4.36	I had no qualms about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_392.wav	5.42	Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_393.wav	5.97	McMaster had already seen the first part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_394.wav	4.99	It's about my time as a guitarist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_395.wav	4.99	We have been working closely with Holyrood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_396.wav	3.80	It was early morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_397.wav	4.53	Partition is not an option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_398.wav	4.91	What other retailer would do this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_399.wav	5.04	This is usually done by the space shuttle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_400.wav	5.72	Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_401.wav	3.86	I won't go back to Holland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_402.wav	5.72	In his absence, the council adopted the change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_403.wav	3.24	There was no cohesion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_404.wav	6.06	He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_405.wav	4.01	Whether this return was too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_406.wav	4.01	Jackson may well be right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_407.wav	3.63	My thoughts are with their families.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_408.wav	3.46	I saw some good things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_410.wav	3.97	Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_411.wav	4.44	Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_412.wav	3.55	But who gets on the tube?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_413.wav	5.08	In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_414.wav	3.84	Now you see him, now you don't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_416.wav	4.01	So now this series has had its day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_417.wav	4.27	Gaelic provision continued to be good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_418.wav	4.74	Bobby Robson called him a genius.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_419.wav	4.35	It's a policy which has worked for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_420.wav	4.10	Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_421.wav	3.25	His views are hardly surprising.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_422.wav	3.76	His wife Margaret was not in court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_423.wav	5.46	Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p307\p307_424.wav	3.59	Nobody else was with me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_001.wav	2.39	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_002.wav	4.01	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_003.wav	8.02	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_004.wav	5.04	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_005.wav	6.06	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_006.wav	5.68	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_007.wav	4.48	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_008.wav	7.54	They take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_009.wav	5.89	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_010.wav	3.38	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_011.wav	6.83	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_012.wav	4.74	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_013.wav	4.44	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_014.wav	5.46	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_015.wav	5.81	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_016.wav	6.74	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_017.wav	3.88	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_018.wav	5.34	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_019.wav	7.81	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_020.wav	4.31	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_021.wav	8.96	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_022.wav	6.10	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition on a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_023.wav	10.24	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_024.wav	6.70	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_025.wav	3.42	It does make a big difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_026.wav	3.20	George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_027.wav	3.07	Each one has its own system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_028.wav	4.18	Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_029.wav	3.59	From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_030.wav	2.65	It is a very special city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_031.wav	3.21	It has been blown out of all proportion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_032.wav	2.73	He is not very big, either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_033.wav	2.43	I've taken to the hills.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_034.wav	2.90	My game is in pretty good shape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_035.wav	3.33	How come it is so often unnoticed?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_036.wav	4.31	I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_037.wav	3.16	We used to keep our business rates.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_038.wav	3.67	It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_039.wav	2.90	All of us do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_040.wav	3.89	On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_041.wav	3.20	It could have been just a quick fix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_042.wav	3.29	We are looking for volunteers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_043.wav	3.12	Theatre is not a museum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_044.wav	3.29	Subs not used, McCulloch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_045.wav	4.48	Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_046.wav	2.99	He could face a jail sentence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_047.wav	2.95	They don't take you to mass graves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_048.wav	3.29	What's it got to do with art?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_049.wav	4.10	Happily we found it in the library.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_050.wav	3.42	I know a lot of people who don't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_051.wav	3.33	There was nobody on the roof.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_052.wav	4.31	He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_053.wav	3.76	We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_054.wav	4.31	It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_055.wav	4.01	The days of empty promises are over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_056.wav	4.10	Henry was strong and talented.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_057.wav	4.74	I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_058.wav	3.72	We must improve our relations with government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_059.wav	4.27	Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_060.wav	3.46	Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_061.wav	4.35	Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_062.wav	3.55	He said it was the worst possible result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_063.wav	4.18	The quality of life is difficult for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_064.wav	3.97	Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_065.wav	3.59	It is just part of modern day life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_066.wav	3.59	A young Briton had a lucky escape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_067.wav	3.29	Treatment is not an issue with these people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_068.wav	2.86	YOU thought it was a headache.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_069.wav	2.95	I hope we can put it behind us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_070.wav	2.48	But it was to no avail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_071.wav	3.29	There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_072.wav	4.06	I'm thinking, what would be easier?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_073.wav	2.90	That alibi is now gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_074.wav	3.46	We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_075.wav	3.88	He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_076.wav	2.78	You do have a way out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_077.wav	2.95	It is simple, really.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_078.wav	3.24	I cannot believe she has been admonished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_079.wav	2.73	I was in jail for five years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_080.wav	3.50	You, the British people, are the boss.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_081.wav	3.97	A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_082.wav	4.31	PR for Westminster is their holy grail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_083.wav	4.57	They won the trophy in the Hoops.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_084.wav	3.84	I never won a penny throughout my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_085.wav	4.74	Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_086.wav	3.80	She could easily have been killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_087.wav	4.87	Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_088.wav	4.35	We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_089.wav	3.59	It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_090.wav	2.61	The same goes for personnel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_091.wav	2.73	He was a crazy man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_092.wav	3.29	We don't say there wasn't a massacre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_093.wav	3.84	That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_094.wav	3.93	The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_095.wav	2.77	There was an element of jealousy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_096.wav	2.78	Craig is still suffering seizures.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_097.wav	6.23	Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_098.wav	5.93	That certainly brought me back down to earth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_099.wav	5.68	Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_100.wav	4.18	We have no idea what caused the derailment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_101.wav	4.82	Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_102.wav	3.50	Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_103.wav	5.00	He is only now regaining his confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_104.wav	3.76	Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_105.wav	4.65	It separates the men from the boys.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_106.wav	4.57	But that attachment took a lot of growing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_107.wav	3.76	You'll get on like a house on fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_108.wav	3.29	Two and a half million people have died.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_109.wav	3.12	Or so it would appear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_110.wav	3.33	I hope they understand that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_111.wav	3.50	Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_112.wav	3.46	She will also get a pay rise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_113.wav	4.31	They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_114.wav	3.67	It is time for a more honest approach.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_115.wav	3.37	The move is considered a major breakthrough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_116.wav	4.27	I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_117.wav	3.20	I want to play at the highest level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_118.wav	3.20	Stalkers are capable of killing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_119.wav	2.74	It ignores the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_120.wav	2.78	Britain may now be forced to listen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_121.wav	3.63	The trial is set for February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_122.wav	5.64	Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_123.wav	6.32	Do not go into government buildings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_124.wav	2.48	There is only one caveat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_125.wav	3.29	We are still getting signals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_126.wav	3.20	And perhaps it is as simple as that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_127.wav	3.16	They prefer the short, intensive session.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_128.wav	4.19	THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_129.wav	3.93	The New Deal will constantly be improved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_130.wav	3.89	THE headless man has finally developed a face.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_131.wav	3.08	I heard some of his remarks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_132.wav	3.37	Mary Archer is almost too clever.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_133.wav	4.05	I was just overwhelmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_134.wav	3.12	It had been in place since last July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_135.wav	4.36	The European Court is our only option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_136.wav	2.74	Do you think they would do any better?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_137.wav	4.82	We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_138.wav	4.27	Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_139.wav	3.46	The singer's condition was not specified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_140.wav	2.60	How much of a cop out is that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_141.wav	2.69	The whole region is in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_142.wav	2.99	It will be the final push.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_143.wav	3.97	Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_144.wav	3.42	You were the kidnappers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_145.wav	3.16	It is a very interesting subject.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_146.wav	5.51	The women were on their way home yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_147.wav	2.94	I could feel the blood on my face.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_148.wav	3.67	The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_149.wav	3.16	Well, it's not before time, is it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_150.wav	2.90	Debbie Harry was cool.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_151.wav	3.50	Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_152.wav	3.63	That sort of thing is long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_153.wav	2.65	I'm afraid to say anything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_154.wav	2.90	I know you went back this morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_155.wav	4.06	We did not want an absentee landlord.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_156.wav	3.33	These men could be anywhere in the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_157.wav	3.25	Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_158.wav	4.06	A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_159.wav	3.12	It's my favourite place to hang out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_160.wav	3.55	Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_161.wav	3.89	He will make an excellent chief inspector.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_162.wav	2.60	The red card was okay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_163.wav	4.40	Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_164.wav	3.63	But they will not be compelled to join.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_165.wav	3.67	However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_166.wav	3.03	I was doing well at the hustings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_167.wav	3.72	But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_168.wav	3.59	After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_169.wav	2.69	We must put a marker down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_170.wav	3.33	But she's also beautiful behind the face.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_171.wav	3.42	There is no date on this document.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_172.wav	2.73	And now he tells us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_173.wav	4.27	Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_174.wav	3.29	They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_175.wav	2.99	It is time to come into the limelight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_176.wav	3.89	It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_177.wav	3.12	His name is Michael Owen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_178.wav	3.29	For now, we must take one game at a time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_179.wav	3.33	I will have to order its destruction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_180.wav	3.12	I foolishly had done nothing about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_181.wav	4.27	Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_182.wav	3.84	By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_183.wav	3.11	Smith has not let him down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_184.wav	4.10	No, it's actually in a block of flats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_185.wav	3.67	Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_186.wav	2.43	They've two children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_187.wav	3.16	Luckily, our patient was stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_188.wav	2.86	I'm really proud of my young players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_189.wav	3.08	People buy everything with cash.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_190.wav	3.80	There was great support all round the route.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_191.wav	4.01	It's amazing it happened in the daytime.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_192.wav	2.65	I felt we had fallen back a little.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_193.wav	4.35	Scottish fishermen condemned the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_194.wav	7.51	Or so we have long assumed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_195.wav	8.92	Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_196.wav	5.17	To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_197.wav	5.08	It's not just for classical music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_198.wav	3.50	This must be kept in total perspective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_199.wav	3.37	All of the names are familiar to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_200.wav	3.03	They had not been handcuffed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_201.wav	4.65	It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_202.wav	8.71	I've never been limited on drugs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_203.wav	4.83	They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_204.wav	5.12	Have we not had the rainy season already?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_205.wav	3.67	We have chosen for the patients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_206.wav	3.42	He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_207.wav	3.33	Why should we even be asked to share?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_208.wav	2.48	Which means it matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_209.wav	2.95	There is great potential on this river.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_210.wav	2.69	I was surprised by his response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_211.wav	3.54	This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_212.wav	3.50	River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_213.wav	3.50	Officials say the city must achieve this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_214.wav	3.59	It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_215.wav	2.05	Is this accurate?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_216.wav	3.97	A judicial review is also being considered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_217.wav	4.23	It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_218.wav	3.20	They could go no further forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_219.wav	3.12	I don't know why you say goodbye.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_220.wav	4.77	Appointed general secretary last September.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_221.wav	2.95	They make it look very easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_222.wav	3.24	It was a total surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_223.wav	2.99	I had enough on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_224.wav	2.44	And we're not there yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_225.wav	2.99	No meaningful response was issued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_226.wav	3.41	It is a form of physical exercise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_227.wav	2.26	plays in dark blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_228.wav	3.20	But, by that time, of course, it is again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_229.wav	3.03	It is something that we will put right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_230.wav	2.90	Survival is our aim.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_231.wav	3.46	There is no reason at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_232.wav	3.63	This is her first senior Scottish selection.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_233.wav	3.67	There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_234.wav	2.74	I'm pleased with the horse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_235.wav	3.97	But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_236.wav	3.88	There is a club on the rise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_237.wav	3.13	I had a sense of deja vu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_238.wav	4.14	His silence on the issue is interesting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_239.wav	2.73	They follow him everywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_240.wav	3.03	I couldn't make out what was going on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_241.wav	2.60	There was no safety net.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_242.wav	3.76	So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_243.wav	3.33	I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_244.wav	3.89	I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_245.wav	3.29	Mr Miller is married with three children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_246.wav	3.93	Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_247.wav	3.55	We have great sympathy with Danny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_248.wav	3.29	He should be a great asset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_249.wav	5.12	It means they actually control the programme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_250.wav	4.02	And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_251.wav	3.12	We are not out of touch with politics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_252.wav	3.29	We could have got three medals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_253.wav	4.10	Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_254.wav	3.55	We are at a crossroads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_255.wav	3.37	We are satisfied with this outcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_256.wav	3.03	Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_257.wav	2.56	It didn't take long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_258.wav	3.42	This meeting is the path to salvation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_259.wav	4.91	Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_260.wav	3.89	I started on fire a couple of times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_261.wav	3.08	He also received a medal of honour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_262.wav	3.33	It's not one for the purists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_263.wav	3.29	She said he showed no remorse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_264.wav	3.37	I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_265.wav	3.80	We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_266.wav	2.13	It is a time bomb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_267.wav	2.86	It's a matter of huge concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_268.wav	3.33	Harrowing is easy, after all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_269.wav	3.58	Three years probation is just a joke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_270.wav	4.44	The outstanding issues are still there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_271.wav	4.91	Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_272.wav	4.52	I'm not sure how they got there, but they are.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_273.wav	3.33	And that's good news for the magpies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_274.wav	5.59	He always has been, since his early days with Scottish Opera.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_275.wav	2.31	That got me out of jail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_276.wav	2.90	We've turned the corner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_277.wav	3.59	This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_278.wav	3.42	The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_279.wav	4.65	Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_280.wav	3.86	However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_281.wav	2.82	We've taken steps to rectify it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_282.wav	3.38	I see no need for change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_283.wav	3.08	Do yourselves a favour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_284.wav	3.88	Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_285.wav	3.33	Others said they had been beaten by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_286.wav	4.23	The new system will be marketed this summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_287.wav	2.95	I'd love to be like Peter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_288.wav	3.29	Then came the collision with Sergio.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_289.wav	4.01	We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_290.wav	4.14	Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_291.wav	3.72	His is a success story by any standard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_292.wav	4.48	Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_293.wav	3.50	I shall be voting Yes to support him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_294.wav	3.50	Is something which we just don't do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_295.wav	2.74	We work on the same level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_296.wav	2.73	I've got a young family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_297.wav	2.94	I'm trying to stay open on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_298.wav	2.90	It all seemed so easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_299.wav	3.46	I really don't understand what is happening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_300.wav	2.65	The frustration was showing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_301.wav	4.36	Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_302.wav	2.52	I am a wealthy person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_303.wav	2.95	My friends were very envious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_304.wav	2.94	The snipers are also out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_305.wav	3.38	Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_306.wav	3.16	We're determined to establish the facts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_307.wav	3.97	The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_308.wav	3.29	The list is too long for this piece.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_309.wav	4.65	If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_310.wav	3.80	Entries for the event are still being accepted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_311.wav	3.46	It plans to return to this field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_312.wav	3.76	However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_313.wav	3.33	To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_314.wav	3.38	Tonight's matches European Championship.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_315.wav	2.22	It's like the Russians.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_316.wav	2.18	Is that Titanic?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_317.wav	2.10	Let us hope so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_318.wav	2.86	So, the question is, is it any good?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_319.wav	2.61	I'm getting back up there now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_320.wav	3.24	I couldn't see any reason not to die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_321.wav	3.03	My players have no idea about football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_322.wav	3.46	They are there to get people into work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_323.wav	2.86	I'm getting long in the tooth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_324.wav	3.84	They would be wise to do just that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_325.wav	4.44	Strathclyde Police yesterday declined to comment on Ferris.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_326.wav	3.97	Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_327.wav	3.50	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_328.wav	5.29	Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_329.wav	2.82	She had gone to the Catholic school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_330.wav	3.12	Then we will face the Danish champions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_331.wav	2.73	I'd go to bookshops.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_332.wav	3.12	It is time to fight a decisive battle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_333.wav	3.67	This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_334.wav	4.48	Its national defence policy is defensive in nature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_335.wav	3.46	Military chiefs were playing it straight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_336.wav	3.93	Adams is surely worth a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_337.wav	3.50	There was no hint of bravado.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_338.wav	2.99	You've been a great audience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_339.wav	3.63	ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_340.wav	3.71	By then, however, both men were already in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_341.wav	2.99	She's a valuable member of the Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_342.wav	2.43	I just need a bit of luck.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_343.wav	3.88	The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_344.wav	3.03	I always felt they played for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_345.wav	3.80	Again, it's about responding to your resources.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_346.wav	3.24	Managers and clinicians must work together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_347.wav	3.46	The princess has had other health problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_348.wav	2.82	Everything else is a bonus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_349.wav	2.61	The hotel was now for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_350.wav	2.99	There are two games to go after that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_351.wav	3.67	Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_352.wav	4.74	His replacement was named yesterday, following inquiries by The Herald.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_353.wav	4.82	Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_354.wav	4.22	She now suffers from multiple sclerosis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_355.wav	3.21	It was a UK-wide report.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_356.wav	3.08	This is a dreadful day for Iona.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_357.wav	4.27	He spoke about the choices facing them, and their country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_358.wav	3.71	It could be done by experts and lawyers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_359.wav	3.16	The discussions will surely not last too long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_360.wav	4.31	We'll talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_361.wav	3.80	They have not let anyone into the loop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_362.wav	3.42	So just what is her enduring appeal?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_363.wav	2.56	It's not easy to live in Russia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_364.wav	4.10	I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_365.wav	3.71	Last night was a key episode.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_366.wav	3.72	I grew up listening to these people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_367.wav	3.63	It is normal for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_368.wav	3.42	But it may not be all bad news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_369.wav	5.51	It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_370.wav	3.16	I am content with the silver.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_371.wav	2.82	We have fun in our lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_372.wav	3.16	This, too, could prove a risky business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_373.wav	2.78	You have to audition for jobs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_374.wav	3.08	We're not comparing like with like.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_375.wav	2.86	Ferguson should take note.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_376.wav	4.18	We have always been, and remain confident of securing the order.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_377.wav	3.50	The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_378.wav	3.20	They've got three-quarters of the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_379.wav	3.84	I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_380.wav	3.67	She was released from hospital yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_381.wav	3.54	That is not just my personal view.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_382.wav	3.48	The move follows a review of the Singapore
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_383.wav	3.67	It's like a garage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_384.wav	3.81	This gives a financial incentive to switch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_385.wav	5.08	It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_386.wav	3.72	Liberal Democrat leader makes a hash of it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_387.wav	2.52	You just have to accept.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_388.wav	2.44	We've got to get it right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_389.wav	3.59	The trouble is, though, that there is no simple solution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_390.wav	3.37	His death was a tragic accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_391.wav	3.50	Would you take them?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_392.wav	2.77	I find it puzzling and disturbing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_393.wav	3.54	He lost his job, but it was not just a job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_394.wav	2.94	His condition was stable last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_395.wav	3.20	I'd never seen a play about me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_396.wav	4.99	At present it is fairly uncommon, but its incidence is increasing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_397.wav	4.01	The report is due out next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_398.wav	3.20	It was nerve-racking to watch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_399.wav	2.39	It remains in public ownership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_400.wav	3.25	The Master was by then just too old.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_401.wav	3.88	All credit to them, they took their chances, we didn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_402.wav	3.16	Sub Not Used, McArthur.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_403.wav	3.46	It's a very high number.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_404.wav	2.78	I leave tonight for England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_405.wav	4.27	She didn't tell me anything the night before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_406.wav	4.27	This is a thoroughly handsome and enjoyable production.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_407.wav	3.80	No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_408.wav	3.50	He was dead on arrival at hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_409.wav	3.21	I have no argument with Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_410.wav	3.59	There are simply no orders.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_411.wav	4.01	Sutton is playing as well as ever today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_412.wav	4.14	Like anyone else, he has to take his time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_413.wav	4.82	It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_414.wav	3.89	The problem in Norway is outside the National.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_415.wav	2.82	She took them for a term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_416.wav	3.71	I haven't spoken to anyone about that, not even my wife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_417.wav	3.59	Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_418.wav	2.26	Or so she thought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_419.wav	2.99	It was another good idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_420.wav	4.18	This would discourage investment and job creation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_421.wav	3.50	The Foreign Office was conspicuous by its absence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_422.wav	3.33	Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p308\p308_423.wav	3.03	In fact, they should have scored three times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_001.wav	2.35	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_002.wav	5.89	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_003.wav	10.97	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_004.wav	9.43	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_005.wav	8.28	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_006.wav	7.54	When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_007.wav	8.07	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_008.wav	8.45	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and these two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_009.wav	5.08	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_010.wav	3.71	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_011.wav	7.89	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_012.wav	5.17	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_013.wav	5.76	Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_014.wav	6.61	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_015.wav	6.62	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_016.wav	9.22	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to the home in the skies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_017.wav	4.99	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_018.wav	6.53	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_019.wav	8.79	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_020.wav	6.02	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_021.wav	16.52	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_022.wav	9.35	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_023.wav	19.28	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_024.wav	7.85	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_025.wav	4.95	He was the youngest of the British team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_026.wav	2.99	I fell in love with the ballet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_027.wav	6.19	That their music is truly, truly, truly great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_028.wav	3.93	It feels like a winner already.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_029.wav	3.11	Did you see that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_030.wav	6.79	The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_031.wav	3.33	And the winners are.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_032.wav	4.53	I can't believe something like this could happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_033.wav	6.70	Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_034.wav	4.18	He didn't really, we just made that up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_035.wav	4.01	Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_036.wav	5.55	Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_037.wav	4.44	It is easy to be wise in hindsight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_038.wav	4.66	We're still talking with a few people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_039.wav	3.29	But one shouldn't go by that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_040.wav	4.78	Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_041.wav	4.23	Buying our way out is not an option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_042.wav	2.52	There are big names.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_043.wav	2.90	That argument has been won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_044.wav	4.35	Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_045.wav	6.28	He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_046.wav	5.59	And who would argue with that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_047.wav	4.52	I hope you will leave it at that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_048.wav	5.76	We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_049.wav	2.86	They had four children together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_050.wav	3.93	Again, that was genuine loyalty being recognised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_051.wav	7.04	Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_052.wav	3.16	I fell to the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_053.wav	5.08	They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_054.wav	3.16	They were not defeated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_055.wav	4.18	Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_056.wav	7.30	How can they engage with the work?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_057.wav	3.59	All of us know it exists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_058.wav	7.81	Moray Council could not be contacted last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_059.wav	2.77	This is the band.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_060.wav	3.59	She has a wonderful mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_061.wav	4.14	There are just two tournaments remaining.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_062.wav	3.59	We're into that build-up now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_063.wav	4.18	It is the end of an era.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_064.wav	2.82	We shall not do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_065.wav	5.68	I have had no social life at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_066.wav	3.72	Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_067.wav	3.38	Once again, he refused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_068.wav	4.57	This is about the Orange Order.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_069.wav	4.35	In fact, they will not be disciplined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_070.wav	2.86	We're not the tourist board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_071.wav	4.10	Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_072.wav	6.02	Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_073.wav	3.80	The Commons is too outdated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_074.wav	3.84	Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_075.wav	4.19	That was then and this is now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_076.wav	4.74	Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_077.wav	4.83	Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_078.wav	3.25	Are you watching Liverpool?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_079.wav	3.16	He would be with his peers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_080.wav	5.51	They seem to be backing off from that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_081.wav	2.43	But it took a lot of bottle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_082.wav	3.37	They don't work anymore anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_083.wav	3.33	I wish they, too, would get a grip.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_084.wav	2.18	I am so sorry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_085.wav	3.16	This avalanche is just beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_086.wav	2.57	Journalists should make him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_087.wav	2.95	I believe we have a good chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_088.wav	4.01	However, it is no longer with the national team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_089.wav	3.46	She may even appear in some more films.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_090.wav	3.29	This is the best moment of my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_091.wav	3.63	He also called in at another farm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_092.wav	3.50	I don't know why she is not here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_093.wav	3.84	England could not take anything for granted, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_094.wav	2.39	I agree with them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_095.wav	3.63	I feel very strongly about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_096.wav	3.03	Now he will have to start again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_097.wav	3.29	It is a difficult thing to explain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_098.wav	2.95	I don't know how it happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_099.wav	2.82	Peter doesn't want to leave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_100.wav	3.63	After that nothing could save him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_101.wav	3.54	Construction is due to begin in February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_102.wav	3.25	We shall rely on human beings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_103.wav	3.50	In fact, that would be a distortion of the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_104.wav	3.12	He wouldn't allow that to happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_105.wav	3.42	His treatment has been quite atrocious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_106.wav	3.88	It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_107.wav	2.77	Or, rather, it isn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_108.wav	3.67	The picture is the same across Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_109.wav	4.14	Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_110.wav	3.07	My dad was working in Ayrshire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_111.wav	3.97	There are lots of these women in Finland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_112.wav	3.67	I will not be in dialogue with her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_113.wav	3.03	But there is another side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_114.wav	3.54	Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_115.wav	2.90	There is no guarantee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_116.wav	3.67	I'm confident we can turn things around.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_117.wav	4.65	We want to get to the final, anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_118.wav	2.43	It may be argued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_119.wav	4.18	He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_120.wav	3.16	I bought a car at auction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_121.wav	5.04	And who were they anyway, beforehand?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_122.wav	4.14	His three-year appointment begins on Monday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_123.wav	3.71	Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_124.wav	4.01	Five in a month isn't good enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_125.wav	4.65	Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_126.wav	3.63	This is just one example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_127.wav	3.42	Both offices were closed yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_128.wav	3.97	They don't have to, but they normally do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_129.wav	3.07	We stopped at half-time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_130.wav	4.61	Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_131.wav	2.95	David was not either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_132.wav	5.00	Britain may now be forced to listen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_133.wav	3.13	We don't see it as downgrading.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_134.wav	3.80	He wanted someone young and ambitious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_135.wav	3.76	No date has been set for the appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_136.wav	3.07	He is dying from cancer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_137.wav	4.68	People can describe a moment in their life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_138.wav	2.57	What's the rush?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_139.wav	2.82	The starting point is pretty unusual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_140.wav	4.40	However, they will only be found in the wild.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_141.wav	4.91	They receive a high profile in the media.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_142.wav	2.57	It was an ambush.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_143.wav	3.80	I think this proposal is excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_144.wav	5.76	If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_145.wav	3.42	Is that too much to ask?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_146.wav	5.04	The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_147.wav	3.50	I've so much respect for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_148.wav	3.50	Each one has its own system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_149.wav	3.71	I felt under no pressure today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_150.wav	4.10	The Devil is the creator of weapons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_151.wav	3.72	And that was the adults.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_152.wav	4.74	Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_153.wav	3.33	This is a job for the Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_154.wav	4.06	I felt the head was very like me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_155.wav	3.76	We started with that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_156.wav	3.25	And he had much need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_157.wav	3.67	Last night the bombardment was terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_158.wav	3.24	This can only help us go forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_159.wav	3.08	It's never the same problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_160.wav	5.72	But, even so, you always want to try something new.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_161.wav	5.01	Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_162.wav	4.18	I hadn't been looking after myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_163.wav	2.65	I was over the moon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_164.wav	4.40	And really, the songs are the key thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_165.wav	2.78	Four minutes later, the show was over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_166.wav	3.59	His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_167.wav	3.93	Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_168.wav	3.25	And then came the seventies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_169.wav	3.03	I guess it is down to focus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_170.wav	4.06	Last week, he was taken to the hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_171.wav	4.99	You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_172.wav	4.44	His track record is not promising.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_173.wav	8.07	No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_174.wav	3.03	He put a lot of effort into it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_175.wav	3.20	However, you have just got to adjust it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_176.wav	4.48	That was moving the goalposts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_177.wav	3.89	He was pronounced dead in hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_178.wav	4.57	We have the location, which is assured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_179.wav	5.04	The club are feeling no different today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_180.wav	5.93	What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_181.wav	4.40	I see the extended family once a year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_182.wav	2.26	I'm not a magician.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_183.wav	3.20	We couldn't go very fast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_185.wav	2.35	There was even a joke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_186.wav	2.99	Tony Blair, can you see her face?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_187.wav	3.46	This guy is never going to give up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_188.wav	3.67	They had previously been on five-day notice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_189.wav	4.70	But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_190.wav	3.63	The show is small but perfectly formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_191.wav	4.36	This is the first job of the director - leadership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_192.wav	5.46	It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_193.wav	3.67	It is too early to speculate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_194.wav	3.38	I just had so much fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_195.wav	5.04	Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_196.wav	2.74	I will wait until later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_197.wav	4.82	Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_198.wav	4.40	She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_199.wav	3.25	Or so we have long assumed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_200.wav	3.76	They responded with victories.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_201.wav	3.63	That was the personal impulse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_202.wav	6.06	I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_203.wav	3.67	But first it goes out on TV.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_204.wav	3.37	What is the truth about the cow?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_205.wav	4.27	They will want to watch a winning team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_206.wav	2.09	I think it's awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_207.wav	3.89	Who is going to be penalised?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_208.wav	3.37	This will be just another tax on motorists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_209.wav	2.99	I feel sorry for the Reds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_210.wav	3.20	One must hope not!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_211.wav	2.82	He is a Satan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_212.wav	4.36	Just see where the blood is coming from.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_213.wav	5.12	He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_214.wav	3.33	In her opinion, the rich are different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_215.wav	5.77	Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_216.wav	4.83	I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_217.wav	2.90	There was no cohesion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_218.wav	2.91	He was jailed for five years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_219.wav	4.06	Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_220.wav	2.78	We will not break even.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_221.wav	2.52	We will look into it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_222.wav	4.57	IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_223.wav	3.84	But he's not afraid to take risks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_224.wav	2.82	Some of his family still live there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_225.wav	4.22	However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_226.wav	6.02	However, it very nearly went wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_227.wav	4.44	Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_228.wav	2.95	Things are moving together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_229.wav	4.36	I get to work with very good people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_230.wav	3.67	A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_231.wav	3.76	He must not be removed from office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_232.wav	8.07	Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_233.wav	5.08	Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_234.wav	2.56	Look at the table.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_235.wav	3.37	This film will be totally awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_236.wav	3.89	I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_237.wav	4.23	Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_238.wav	3.08	Last year was not a good year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_239.wav	2.86	It's a difficult job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_240.wav	2.52	We can't get over it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_241.wav	3.33	Several hundred people attended yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_242.wav	3.84	My preference is for the single vaccines.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_243.wav	4.53	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_244.wav	3.84	He saw it all as a big game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_245.wav	2.82	They are not an item.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_246.wav	5.04	And thought we would get away with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_247.wav	2.99	I can't wait for the outdoors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_248.wav	3.76	It's more like a Labour Party rally.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_249.wav	4.14	Staff should be paid for what they produce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_250.wav	4.36	I would urge the Government to think again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_251.wav	4.23	It will be even more difficult tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_252.wav	3.55	They were on holiday in Egypt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_253.wav	4.10	I was happiest with my short game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_254.wav	7.34	We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_255.wav	3.97	We went on to become very successful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_256.wav	7.94	Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_257.wav	4.31	No, is the answer to your first question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_258.wav	3.84	We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_259.wav	3.25	That could be at least five years away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_260.wav	2.22	That is my role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_261.wav	2.69	He also presented You Bet!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_262.wav	2.26	That's the day job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_263.wav	3.08	It really is taken seriously.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_264.wav	2.74	We have not given up hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_265.wav	3.50	I'm looking at ways to do that now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_266.wav	4.01	Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_267.wav	2.74	It's such a trial!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_268.wav	3.76	That kind of growth is the important thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_269.wav	3.12	I think it is totally wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_270.wav	2.65	And a film maker was born.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_271.wav	3.37	It was also put on the Internet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_272.wav	4.14	The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_273.wav	3.29	And yet his legacy is doubtful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_274.wav	2.60	It seems to have worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_275.wav	3.80	Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_276.wav	2.56	There was a battle there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_277.wav	4.27	This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_278.wav	4.44	Well, when did he ever refuse?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_279.wav	3.79	Today's ruling confirms that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_280.wav	3.72	It's good news and long overdue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_281.wav	4.78	THE atmosphere was electric.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_282.wav	3.71	I'd never heard him in person before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_283.wav	3.03	We're going to change our party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_284.wav	5.42	Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_285.wav	2.94	I have learned a lot from him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_286.wav	3.29	Is he any good in the kitchen?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_287.wav	3.89	He has been campaigning for change for years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_288.wav	3.97	A formal decision will be announced within months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_289.wav	3.29	He must have something up his sleeve.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_290.wav	3.20	He was at home with his pals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_291.wav	3.08	We make good weapons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_292.wav	9.94	So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_293.wav	3.12	This is not a Scottish problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_294.wav	3.16	Then followed a bout of flu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_295.wav	3.63	The balance isn't there at EMI.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_296.wav	4.27	That was the most annoying thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_297.wav	2.95	We are being hijacked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_298.wav	2.56	We had no part in it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_299.wav	3.97	It wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_300.wav	3.67	Mike Tyson went to prison.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_301.wav	2.99	It was nice to get a clean sheet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_302.wav	3.42	Our young people are leaving.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_303.wav	2.86	And there is no cause for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_304.wav	3.03	That would have been too easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_305.wav	3.59	She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_306.wav	3.46	This is not a faceless system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_307.wav	3.97	This is a long-term discussion paper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_308.wav	4.06	In all cases computer equipment was seized.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_309.wav	3.63	It is just like the stock market.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_310.wav	2.86	The damage from the fire was huge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_311.wav	3.71	That's what it's all about, isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_312.wav	3.59	Both agreed on the success of the event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_313.wav	3.12	What, then, is the real thing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_314.wav	3.42	Boarding school was equally protective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_315.wav	2.60	Most people know that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_316.wav	3.12	It will be the final push.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_317.wav	4.01	Clearly, this was the important nursing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_318.wav	5.59	Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_319.wav	2.78	The campaign was raucous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_320.wav	3.59	On Saturday, it was much the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_321.wav	3.93	But both were involved with other matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_322.wav	2.29	But we were wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_323.wav	3.20	The result today is an impasse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_324.wav	4.27	However, in October another partnership was announced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_325.wav	2.90	There is no threat to them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_326.wav	2.73	Nelson does not disappoint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_327.wav	2.90	The goal will stay with me forever.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_328.wav	5.16	The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_329.wav	4.57	Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_330.wav	3.12	It is a high time to act.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_331.wav	4.99	Then we will face the Danish champions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_332.wav	6.40	He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_333.wav	4.40	The South African defended his work ethic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_334.wav	3.97	We have a team to reach the final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_335.wav	5.04	There was barely a handful of chances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_336.wav	4.99	The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_337.wav	3.08	I have found my vision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_338.wav	4.44	We don't know the scale of need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_339.wav	3.80	You need a reason for staying.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_340.wav	4.23	Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_341.wav	4.23	However, we have not come to any conclusions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_342.wav	4.66	I don't expect to see that this time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_343.wav	5.38	You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_344.wav	3.20	The big issue for us is the review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_345.wav	3.54	That is not the way we should operate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_346.wav	4.82	More likely, perhaps, it is that he will stay in England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_347.wav	4.44	The new work will begin in the autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_348.wav	4.66	The written judgment was issued in printed form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_349.wav	4.49	He showed he has some things to learn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_350.wav	2.05	Or do they?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_351.wav	3.08	They are the innocent victims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_352.wav	3.33	It is now time for justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_353.wav	2.65	That is of no use.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_354.wav	3.80	I could have been offended.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_355.wav	4.44	Now it is measuring it in dollars.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_356.wav	3.63	But he is frustrated at every turn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_357.wav	6.06	He was down the right, the left, and through the middle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_358.wav	3.59	This is the lowest of the low.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_359.wav	4.82	Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_360.wav	4.65	Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_361.wav	3.42	He's a nice guy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_362.wav	3.37	The milk industry is in turmoil.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_363.wav	3.71	I love the moment of being first.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_364.wav	3.25	It is a decision which has paid off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_365.wav	2.74	Their mind was already made up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_366.wav	3.55	I had some time with Aston Villa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_367.wav	2.73	But it's got to be worth it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_368.wav	4.87	But does the same thing happen with music?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_369.wav	4.06	I just couldn't believe what had happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_370.wav	3.20	Alex is a big part of that future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_371.wav	2.52	Pray that is so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_372.wav	4.01	In fact it isn't related to either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_373.wav	3.73	There was support from across the board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_374.wav	2.54	There may be some evidence to this effect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_375.wav	4.74	It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_376.wav	2.44	So what does one do?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_377.wav	3.29	Such actions are rarely popular.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_378.wav	5.93	The methadone programme is completely out of control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_379.wav	3.03	That is why it's so lyrical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_380.wav	3.07	I joined a group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_381.wav	4.05	I've heard this stuff about the markets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_382.wav	3.59	It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_383.wav	3.08	It has removed a bit of guilt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_384.wav	4.61	And they all had these other commitments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_385.wav	5.04	However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_386.wav	3.08	Here, again, they were denied a voice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_387.wav	4.52	They were unconfirmed reports that it was a cannabis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_388.wav	4.78	Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_389.wav	2.90	I never agreed with that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_390.wav	3.46	I didn't actually believe them at first.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_391.wav	2.90	Have you heard anything from Paramount?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_392.wav	4.14	We knew their goalkeeper would take the chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_393.wav	4.70	We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_394.wav	3.16	There was only one hole in it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_395.wav	3.03	I don't think it's vital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_396.wav	3.93	It might not survive the process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_397.wav	3.80	They keep the atmosphere in mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_398.wav	3.20	My father died in childbirth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_399.wav	2.82	The issue has still to be resolved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_400.wav	3.37	Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_401.wav	3.41	It is a catalogue of obstruction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_402.wav	3.25	I'm happy to contribute to that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_403.wav	4.10	Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_404.wav	3.08	We were close, but not close enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_405.wav	2.95	And that started me thinking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_406.wav	5.72	Offered the gold medal, he declined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_407.wav	3.50	It brings together two essential elements.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_408.wav	4.40	Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_409.wav	2.69	We had a reunion last week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_410.wav	2.56	This will help our confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_411.wav	2.86	We have high hopes that this will work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_412.wav	2.60	They also have good neighbours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_413.wav	3.42	People ask about the concept of a team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_414.wav	2.35	Who has he fought?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_415.wav	3.71	The film is about the cost of genius.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_416.wav	3.50	They've been here before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_417.wav	2.99	I want a free vote.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_418.wav	3.67	He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_419.wav	4.91	It would show them a positive way forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_420.wav	3.08	I think it's a disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_421.wav	2.56	So he should be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_422.wav	4.01	He also admitted possessing a firearm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_423.wav	4.05	ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p310\p310_424.wav	6.36	Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_001.wav	2.78	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_002.wav	4.18	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_003.wav	7.60	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_004.wav	6.06	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_005.wav	6.53	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_006.wav	6.87	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_007.wav	6.15	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_008.wav	9.01	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_009.wav	4.91	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_010.wav	3.67	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_011.wav	6.49	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_012.wav	5.21	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_013.wav	4.70	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_014.wav	5.21	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_015.wav	6.70	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_016.wav	7.00	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_017.wav	5.16	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_018.wav	5.68	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_019.wav	7.77	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_020.wav	4.66	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_021.wav	9.77	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_022.wav	6.71	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_023.wav	11.18	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_024.wav	7.21	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_025.wav	4.00	No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_026.wav	2.31	It's ahead of Labour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_027.wav	2.60	It is the whole package.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_028.wav	2.31	I was totally wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_029.wav	2.73	It was a matter of chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_030.wav	3.67	Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_031.wav	2.82	Miller was every bit as happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_032.wav	2.52	We keep a distance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_033.wav	3.80	She went home from school and never returned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_034.wav	3.20	Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_035.wav	3.67	With actors it is slightly different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_036.wav	3.63	Green is desperate to play in The Open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_037.wav	2.60	They did a very good job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_038.wav	3.54	That's what we're still trying to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_039.wav	4.48	He tried to stop it, but it was already too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_040.wav	4.06	We cannot go on in this fashion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_041.wav	2.82	We must learn to finish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_042.wav	3.42	There can be no two ways about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_043.wav	3.37	I knew my contract was up this year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_044.wav	2.86	I am content with the silver.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_045.wav	2.86	People acted too quickly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_046.wav	2.82	My heart is with the artist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_047.wav	4.23	That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_048.wav	4.23	There are different cultures in different departments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_049.wav	3.38	What would you do if you didn't work?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_050.wav	3.88	They are already on the way there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_051.wav	3.88	The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_052.wav	2.86	This is a holy place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_053.wav	3.16	We will miss him very much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_054.wav	3.50	As a nation, we must become more active.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_055.wav	2.94	They should go ahead as normal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_056.wav	3.71	At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_057.wav	4.31	It ended as it began, in confusion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_058.wav	3.07	I just went a bit too far.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_059.wav	3.42	I am delighted for Simon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_060.wav	3.37	His third goal was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_061.wav	3.12	I don't have a problem with getting older.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_062.wav	3.12	It has been declared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_063.wav	3.50	Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_064.wav	3.20	The scientific debate is dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_065.wav	2.35	Only one got through.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_066.wav	3.84	In the end, however, it all came together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_067.wav	2.56	He is a visionary.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_068.wav	3.46	I was the trial judge in both.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_069.wav	2.56	I have a choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_070.wav	3.12	It happens in many countries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_071.wav	3.12	It's not just about the shows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_072.wav	3.59	But the cost to his health was enormous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_073.wav	2.60	I have spoken to the skipper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_074.wav	3.29	Already the children are dying.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_075.wav	3.12	Craig is a major concern for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_076.wav	3.20	We don't do this for everyone, of course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_077.wav	2.86	I can't wait to meet him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_078.wav	3.93	THE pain was almost too much to bear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_079.wav	2.99	It's the same as Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_080.wav	2.91	We've got a job to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_081.wav	2.99	You just have to adjust.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_082.wav	2.82	Well, that's just a third district.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_083.wav	3.29	I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_084.wav	2.43	They are there to help us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_085.wav	3.42	He added, We are not prepared for war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_086.wav	3.67	My wife and family are the support system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_087.wav	3.97	Sub Not Used, McArthur.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_088.wav	3.20	I have hardly any commitments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_089.wav	3.84	The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_090.wav	2.90	It is a very special place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_091.wav	3.29	Some things in life you have to accept.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_092.wav	2.78	I am relishing the challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_093.wav	2.82	It is set in Paris.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_094.wav	2.90	The party has never fully recovered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_095.wav	4.01	Everyone is working together to resolve the problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_096.wav	3.42	Surely history will not repeat itself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_097.wav	3.25	The initial report has been completed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_098.wav	2.65	He's got me very well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_099.wav	3.08	It's like an extension of your body.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_100.wav	3.37	It is quite a new prescription.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_101.wav	2.73	Johnsen is equally concerned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_102.wav	2.31	Which he is, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_103.wav	2.78	These matters are now behind us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_104.wav	2.82	But things are never the same again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_105.wav	3.03	It is easy to agree with him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_106.wav	3.16	He, too, will return.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_107.wav	2.99	Is there anything in the wound?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_108.wav	3.54	Chambers said he would accept the place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_109.wav	3.25	Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_110.wav	3.58	It is not really used by many people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_111.wav	3.29	There could be no dispute about our history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_112.wav	3.42	He has one son and one daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_113.wav	2.56	Don't get me wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_114.wav	3.12	It is nearly there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_115.wav	3.38	Otherwise we will pay the price.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_116.wav	3.46	I find it rather oppressive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_117.wav	3.76	They are all Arabs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_118.wav	2.69	It is already making a difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_119.wav	3.25	He decides to do something about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_120.wav	3.46	There were no new cases yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_121.wav	3.67	Someone else has now got them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_122.wav	3.24	But once again it was not converted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_123.wav	3.33	These figures are truly terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_124.wav	3.12	This is a most serious matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_125.wav	3.54	I let go the telephone and ran.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_126.wav	3.89	Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_127.wav	3.71	After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_128.wav	2.61	It was a bit of a shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_129.wav	3.37	The hearing was continued until a later date.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_130.wav	3.20	Still, some additions are inspired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_131.wav	2.78	Planning is a key issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_132.wav	3.03	Did he always want to be a comedian?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_133.wav	2.95	The way ahead is not easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_134.wav	2.77	I could do a better job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_135.wav	3.08	Yet what is supposed to be said?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_136.wav	3.12	Parole isn't a decision for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_137.wav	2.31	I get the bus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_138.wav	3.08	We are still the best team in Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_139.wav	2.56	They got the job done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_140.wav	2.56	It's a horrific incident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_141.wav	3.20	They have been contrasting years, certainly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_142.wav	3.55	Four minutes later, the show was over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_143.wav	3.37	We've not won anything yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_144.wav	3.55	They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_145.wav	4.10	There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_146.wav	3.03	They did not let him down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_147.wav	2.82	I believe in trade unions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_148.wav	3.03	This is in a league of its own.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_149.wav	3.29	It's been such a waste of money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_150.wav	3.03	The money is not really our concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_151.wav	2.14	You just know it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_152.wav	4.36	Now, she has completed a family tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_153.wav	3.97	I certainly think it's very short-sighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_154.wav	2.73	We have the easy part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_155.wav	3.16	At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_156.wav	2.99	It's like a high school play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_157.wav	2.69	He was part of South Africa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_158.wav	2.78	It's there for people to look at.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_159.wav	2.74	The party will make up its own mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_160.wav	3.16	At least two women were among those arrested.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_161.wav	2.86	They never got into the show this time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_162.wav	3.54	But no, it's not funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_163.wav	5.12	In that case, the children were not missing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_164.wav	2.74	He changed my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_165.wav	2.73	There was nothing else to match it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_166.wav	3.42	Two options are being proposed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_167.wav	3.03	They haven't been thought through.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_168.wav	2.69	The criteria have changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_169.wav	3.08	O, Is there a lot of blood?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_170.wav	4.40	Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_171.wav	3.63	I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_172.wav	3.67	He was at home with his pals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_173.wav	3.55	This is a very interesting move.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_174.wav	3.46	The highest rate is in Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_175.wav	2.48	His only reply was a laugh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_176.wav	3.16	those who are preparing to give up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_177.wav	3.59	What kind of festival is proposed?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_178.wav	3.55	I was delighted with every one of them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_179.wav	3.84	Sure the COE is a cracking band.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_180.wav	4.70	Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_181.wav	3.24	That will help my case a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_182.wav	3.46	It was entirely justified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_183.wav	2.95	He looked at me before replying.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_184.wav	2.99	This may be perfectly innocent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_185.wav	3.08	It feels that the game is off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_186.wav	3.03	There will be no change in government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_187.wav	2.73	Another man said, It was horrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_188.wav	2.48	But we still don't know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_189.wav	2.52	Who do you think you are?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_190.wav	3.07	Glasgow is a tour de force.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_191.wav	3.03	I have no battle with the Scots.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_192.wav	2.95	It is all credit to them today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_193.wav	2.95	I have done ever since it was published.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_194.wav	2.95	Nobody could survive on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_195.wav	2.52	They seem to turn up for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_196.wav	2.52	They were kept there for a summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_197.wav	3.38	He confirmed there had been no warning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_198.wav	3.37	It is that sort of film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_199.wav	4.99	She was not hard done by.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_200.wav	2.78	Can you believe it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_201.wav	3.76	I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_202.wav	3.33	They are now out in the cold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_203.wav	5.63	However, planners should be taking the lead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_204.wav	3.67	I'm very frightened of the dark.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_205.wav	3.12	Our message was inclusive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_206.wav	2.95	This has been a shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_207.wav	3.20	Yet the survey has been cautious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_208.wav	4.14	Everything in the symphony is there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_209.wav	3.63	There has also been some Scots input.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_210.wav	3.12	This time, he will be more on the defensive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_211.wav	3.93	There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_212.wav	3.16	But who will buy it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_213.wav	4.14	It had to be more flexible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_214.wav	3.33	Openness is always the best way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_215.wav	2.39	It wouldn't go off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_216.wav	3.42	It can be halted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_217.wav	2.86	This was a lot of numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_218.wav	3.50	Would it be good for the Nationwide League?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_219.wav	4.10	Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_220.wav	2.73	The whole thing has been a nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_221.wav	3.80	He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_222.wav	3.42	The professor said the results were positive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_223.wav	3.12	I think he's the favourite, no question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_224.wav	2.99	But it's just great to have won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_225.wav	2.52	And it paid off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_226.wav	3.33	Gone with them is any sense of narrative.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_227.wav	2.69	Those Were The Days, indeed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_228.wav	3.03	I never made any offer to Mark.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_229.wav	2.48	It should be scrapped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_230.wav	3.22	He admitted the asylum system was not working.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_231.wav	2.49	They are just trying to cover up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_232.wav	3.16	We have to defend ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_233.wav	3.33	I came here this week to work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_234.wav	3.80	Where do we go from here?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_235.wav	3.12	Barry Ferguson is one of them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_236.wav	2.44	He gets his moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_237.wav	3.03	This was an option from the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_238.wav	2.86	Clearly he is keeping in touch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_239.wav	3.29	It's not a party, no, no.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_240.wav	2.91	It's not that clear-cut.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_241.wav	2.91	It may not be life long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_242.wav	3.42	It was just above the roof.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_243.wav	4.66	It has changed, and not for the better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_244.wav	5.42	However, that is a sizeable if.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_245.wav	3.46	Everyone must be focused on the league.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_246.wav	2.39	The English are coming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_247.wav	2.65	I believe in theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_248.wav	3.89	Only four of his passengers were uninjured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_249.wav	4.40	However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_250.wav	2.99	It's time to say enough is enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_251.wav	3.16	Mentally, you have to be tough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_252.wav	2.99	He has to pull back from the brink.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_253.wav	3.76	She has insisted she did nothing wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_254.wav	2.94	That's my daughter acting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_255.wav	2.99	The film has also been superbly designed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_256.wav	3.76	The performance was really, really immense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_257.wav	2.48	Faces from the Eighties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_258.wav	3.37	The family baton is handed on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_259.wav	2.30	How can this be?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_260.wav	2.69	We are still alive and kicking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_261.wav	2.65	I want to go now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_262.wav	3.29	There are many questions to be answered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_263.wav	3.29	Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_264.wav	3.71	All the children on the roll are genuine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_265.wav	3.03	They said we were out of touch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_266.wav	2.73	Sub Not Used, McCormick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_267.wav	2.69	There is no signature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_268.wav	2.73	There is no point in denying that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_269.wav	2.30	The kids are paying the price.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_270.wav	2.95	He said he was delighted by the award.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_271.wav	2.86	They didn't find any substance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_272.wav	2.99	They still have the dirty work to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_273.wav	3.03	I've never seen a game like it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_274.wav	3.16	It doesn't seem like that long ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_275.wav	2.65	He will do very well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_276.wav	3.03	They also intend to travel today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_277.wav	2.56	There's a lot of hysteria.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_278.wav	3.50	The casualties were not named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_279.wav	2.56	I was shaking on the blocks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_280.wav	3.37	There are two ways to start a festival.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_281.wav	3.20	I am very happy with life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_282.wav	3.84	Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_283.wav	3.12	My office is down there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_284.wav	3.29	Even then this game was not over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_285.wav	3.76	Seaman is not a goalkeeper of old.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_286.wav	3.97	We also hope to meet the men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_287.wav	3.63	The defender made an impressive debut.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_288.wav	3.58	It has become very confused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_289.wav	2.48	Fame and money followed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_290.wav	2.99	I am not in denial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_291.wav	3.08	Shelter also supports the reform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_292.wav	4.36	The attack was totally out of the blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_293.wav	4.01	There is a solution, she believes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_294.wav	2.99	So there is a very real dilemma.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_295.wav	3.37	I can't believe we didn't win that game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_296.wav	2.86	Then there's the Old Firm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_297.wav	4.06	I seem to keep this for the majors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_298.wav	4.18	We were in different places, usually in cellars.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_299.wav	3.84	They're not always the same person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_300.wav	3.55	It would have to be backdated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_301.wav	3.20	He said he was sorry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_302.wav	2.56	My position on the euro is quite clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_303.wav	4.44	Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_304.wav	3.80	We have worked well with them for years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_305.wav	3.16	That was me today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_306.wav	4.01	That is the consistent approach of the Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_307.wav	3.63	That is when we are really effective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_308.wav	2.86	The director's a genius.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_309.wav	4.23	There was no sign that anything was amiss.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_310.wav	3.24	It was the climax of the thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_311.wav	2.60	This is new money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_312.wav	2.35	We have not given up on the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_313.wav	3.33	The decision was left entirely to him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_314.wav	2.78	Yes, it was uplifting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_315.wav	2.99	Nobody should believe this story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_316.wav	3.67	This is not out of choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_317.wav	3.85	But don't just take my word, for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_318.wav	3.59	But this one has a lot of potential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_319.wav	2.86	It's a big challenge for the audience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_320.wav	2.73	We'll see what happens.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_321.wav	3.37	This was another video cassette.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_322.wav	4.40	If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_323.wav	2.65	It will make a huge difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_324.wav	2.82	He pretended not to care.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_325.wav	3.29	Not because they want to sing about something.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_326.wav	2.56	I was in tears in the street.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_327.wav	3.71	Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_328.wav	3.93	No doubt the council would welcome the proposal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_329.wav	3.54	But that's not the idea behind this article.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_330.wav	3.88	If he could've prevented it happening, he would have.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_331.wav	3.41	That is why we are here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_332.wav	4.23	The German had a point to make.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_333.wav	4.23	This time, however, may have been different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_334.wav	3.12	You have to feel for the guy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_335.wav	3.72	However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_336.wav	2.78	Bomber was not amused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_337.wav	3.37	They would have been forgiven for doing so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_338.wav	2.82	Was it just negligent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_339.wav	3.63	And suddenly it became a free-for-all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_340.wav	2.99	This Government is cutting taxes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_341.wav	3.37	Things don't look too good at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_342.wav	2.73	This is a big club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_343.wav	3.76	I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_344.wav	3.37	They will now get that support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_345.wav	3.46	I feel it's time to make the switch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_346.wav	2.99	It seemed so personal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_347.wav	3.50	I've no problem with what they said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_348.wav	3.76	He added that he felt undermined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_349.wav	3.67	I think we have got the balance right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_350.wav	3.67	Eriksson would have approved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_351.wav	3.29	It is physical but it is also good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_352.wav	3.20	His behaviour today has been disgusting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_353.wav	3.07	Tyson said he had made a mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_354.wav	1.88	So it goes on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_355.wav	3.16	We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_356.wav	3.42	I hope they will understand the reasons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_357.wav	2.35	They should have listened to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_358.wav	2.56	I am greatly encouraged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_359.wav	2.82	It was like someone had died.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_360.wav	2.46	What does he want him to look like?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_361.wav	3.12	The actors are confident and polished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_362.wav	3.16	I hope he would have been very pleased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_363.wav	3.33	We would have concerns about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_364.wav	2.56	Taxes may need to rise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_365.wav	2.86	It's unusual to say the least.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_366.wav	3.42	All inquiries should be made to the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_367.wav	3.07	Our Great Depression is our lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_368.wav	3.12	I just did not cope with the pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_369.wav	2.69	We have some concerns.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_370.wav	3.16	So he was anxious to try something new.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_371.wav	2.69	This was a chilling echo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_372.wav	2.13	They really want to do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_373.wav	2.26	And then he laughs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_374.wav	2.31	I recommend a tour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_375.wav	2.52	We don't ask for much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_376.wav	3.16	We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_377.wav	3.37	I had a wonderful time working with him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_378.wav	3.20	We have to start again on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_379.wav	3.24	It feels like a winner already.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_380.wav	2.74	And it covers the spectrum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_381.wav	3.29	The replacements made a big difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_382.wav	2.31	And the winners are.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_383.wav	3.20	Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_384.wav	4.44	He didn't really, we just made that up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_385.wav	4.14	Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_386.wav	2.73	There are big names.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_387.wav	3.20	My players are precious to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_388.wav	2.82	That argument has been won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_389.wav	4.05	Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_390.wav	3.80	For us, that decision was hard to understand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_391.wav	2.56	I had to calm down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_392.wav	4.91	Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_393.wav	3.80	She returned home a few days later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_394.wav	2.43	They haven't run away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_395.wav	2.90	Nobody can take it away from me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_396.wav	2.86	She is fulfilled by it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_397.wav	3.33	He said no survivors had been found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_398.wav	2.26	Who can say?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_399.wav	2.27	It is the end of an era.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_400.wav	2.82	In short, the club was broke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_401.wav	3.63	Sadly, in this case, that was not so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_402.wav	2.48	She is a veteran in the Balkans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_403.wav	2.78	The men are safe and unharmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_404.wav	2.65	We're not the tourist board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_405.wav	2.65	It was the same old story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_406.wav	2.35	I was frustrated here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_407.wav	2.95	We have reacted well to each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_408.wav	2.61	Are you watching Liverpool?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_409.wav	2.52	I was furious about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_410.wav	3.08	This will be no easy option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_411.wav	3.46	They knew they shouldn't have been there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_412.wav	2.18	Of course we aren't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_413.wav	2.18	We haven't been told.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_414.wav	2.48	It worked well in Monaco.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_415.wav	2.61	They were outside the circle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_416.wav	2.82	The whole process was so different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_417.wav	3.67	He also called in at another farm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_418.wav	2.35	I agree with them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_419.wav	3.07	I feel very strongly about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_420.wav	2.73	We will listen to colleagues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_421.wav	3.12	It's very difficult and very worrying.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_422.wav	2.91	It's something we want to make work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p311\p311_423.wav	3.41	There will be no excuses on Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_002.wav	3.84	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_003.wav	6.74	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_004.wav	5.63	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_005.wav	7.47	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_006.wav	6.53	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_007.wav	4.61	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_008.wav	8.11	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_009.wav	5.09	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_010.wav	3.80	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_011.wav	7.13	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_012.wav	5.04	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_013.wav	4.53	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_014.wav	6.23	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_015.wav	5.94	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_016.wav	7.30	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_017.wav	3.97	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_018.wav	5.98	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_019.wav	7.85	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_020.wav	5.00	Many complicated ideas about the rainbows have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_021.wav	10.63	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increase as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_022.wav	8.36	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_023.wav	11.61	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_024.wav	6.69	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_025.wav	4.10	Perhaps that was their mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_026.wav	3.55	This was a rationing decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_027.wav	4.14	The way forward is working with other disciplines.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_028.wav	2.78	He is doing the right things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_029.wav	3.29	Blood samples were taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_030.wav	2.78	I've got the poster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_031.wav	3.50	This is excellent news for the workforce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_032.wav	2.91	We have a high quality product.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_033.wav	2.91	Haven't been so lucky since.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_034.wav	2.31	Well, you might have a point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_035.wav	3.59	It was quite distressing for the crew.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_036.wav	3.33	Now the show is for public consumption.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_037.wav	3.33	That decision is now being appealed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_038.wav	2.90	This is really good news for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_039.wav	3.59	I wish it wasn't so, but it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_040.wav	3.59	Not so, it transpires.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_041.wav	3.20	I shouldn't have put up with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_042.wav	4.10	I think so - he seems to be in good health.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_043.wav	3.20	I think it must be the uniforms.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_044.wav	3.93	This is not a monument to the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_045.wav	2.48	I certainly hope not.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_046.wav	3.80	However, there could be more bad weather to come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_047.wav	2.30	I feel pretty good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_048.wav	3.12	The group will report back in the summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_049.wav	2.90	Back then it was hard to refuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_050.wav	3.72	Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_051.wav	2.52	I was in the zone in the morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_052.wav	2.52	We have to break that cycle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_053.wav	2.90	In fact, it might just be the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_054.wav	2.99	The children are being very brave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_055.wav	2.77	They have a car and cannot afford another.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_056.wav	2.61	My only concern is for my children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_057.wav	2.39	This is welcome news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_058.wav	3.25	The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_059.wav	2.90	The trust has no magic wand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_060.wav	3.37	We just wish they had done so before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_061.wav	2.14	It was a virus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_062.wav	2.56	The rest, of course, is history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_063.wav	2.43	They chose the latter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_064.wav	4.27	I've not said anything to them, they know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_065.wav	3.25	All were later allowed home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_066.wav	2.39	Will you just put it away?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_067.wav	3.03	I think it's more important to have fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_068.wav	2.31	Who did the recruiting?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_069.wav	3.72	It is still with Ministers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_070.wav	2.78	The effect was almost magical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_071.wav	2.95	It happened again, and again, and again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_072.wav	2.48	It showed him the way to drive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_073.wav	3.07	I am still waiting for a reply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_074.wav	2.99	After this, they were always in the driving seat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_075.wav	2.47	Were they under-age?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_076.wav	2.86	He was charged with perjury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_077.wav	3.03	I started it, but then forgot all about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_078.wav	2.77	However, there would be no permanent displays.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_079.wav	2.30	The goal will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_080.wav	3.97	He could hardly have been in greater demand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_081.wav	2.87	We didn't take our chances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_082.wav	2.95	It was all very proper and civilised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_083.wav	3.33	I've played them all in the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_084.wav	2.26	There are many children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_085.wav	2.65	That never seemed likely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_086.wav	3.55	Action must be taken urgently.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_087.wav	3.33	I was brought up in a mining background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_088.wav	3.63	Either system could have prevented the crash.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_089.wav	3.16	Here, the fans have been fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_090.wav	2.99	I thought his speech was a disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_091.wav	2.73	But these things are happening now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_092.wav	2.82	I am very encouraged by this poll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_093.wav	2.27	They should be swept away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_094.wav	2.52	They thought the set-up there was unfair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_095.wav	2.69	It will be a challenging film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_096.wav	3.67	The test case is still awaiting action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_097.wav	2.43	What happens next?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_098.wav	3.59	He added, The old system has reached its limits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_099.wav	2.91	We could easily be cut again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_100.wav	2.61	The plot is minimal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_101.wav	3.03	The scheme is hopelessly failing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_102.wav	2.48	They're just a nonsense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_103.wav	2.82	There may be some resistance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_104.wav	2.44	I could not believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_105.wav	4.01	One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_106.wav	3.46	The Rangers think they have problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_107.wav	3.59	He will go a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_108.wav	3.33	Then there was her childhood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_109.wav	3.97	Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_110.wav	3.16	I thought that all musicians were the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_111.wav	2.18	It's so much more fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_112.wav	3.46	I believe he could have turned it around.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_113.wav	3.20	Secondly, there are other options for patients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_114.wav	2.60	Where do you think she is going?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_115.wav	2.52	This looks like it's anything but open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_116.wav	3.50	I am not against a further inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_117.wav	3.89	Such is the scene of the tragedy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_118.wav	2.35	It's a double whammy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_119.wav	1.93	What's the theme?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_120.wav	2.95	We are satisfied that this is the case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_121.wav	2.99	For me, it was a shattering experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_122.wav	2.48	This latter suggestion is very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_123.wav	3.72	The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_124.wav	3.08	Davis is very supportive, as a director.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_125.wav	2.69	There was some merit in that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_126.wav	3.46	That is a trend which will be encouraged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_127.wav	2.09	What's wrong with that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_128.wav	2.18	The pain is still acute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_129.wav	3.42	His remit is specific.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_130.wav	2.43	It is a very big problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_131.wav	2.35	Frustration is not the word.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_132.wav	3.07	The police have to act to help them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_133.wav	2.48	She was extremely rigid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_134.wav	3.12	It may be down, but New York is not out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_135.wav	2.35	But what lies ahead?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_136.wav	2.13	I am so upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_137.wav	2.48	I was blown out of proportion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_138.wav	3.20	There was a definite prejudice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_139.wav	2.86	It's the same with us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_140.wav	2.01	It's an awful lot of money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_141.wav	3.03	He was the architect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_142.wav	4.19	This should include procedures for personal imports.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_143.wav	2.73	It's a fantastic achievement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_144.wav	3.67	Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_145.wav	3.33	He, too, was not satisfied.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_146.wav	2.39	It's easy to see why.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_147.wav	3.16	I've never regretted coming here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_148.wav	3.07	He is in a lot of pain, it's very distressing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_149.wav	3.12	I am so, so, so lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_150.wav	5.25	We still have a long, long way to go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_151.wav	2.22	I fell into it by accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_152.wav	2.56	I only wanted to give her a fright.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_153.wav	2.09	Where does it come from?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_154.wav	2.94	Norman was not doing so bad, either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_155.wav	3.50	If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_156.wav	2.90	It is almost certain to be the last.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_157.wav	2.78	Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_158.wav	3.46	That says something for his strength of character.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_159.wav	3.25	The world is being invited to visit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_160.wav	2.91	If it's not, they didn't go far enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_161.wav	2.22	I think it's a sensible change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_162.wav	2.69	Sex is fun?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_163.wav	1.75	I'm not sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_164.wav	2.73	His first album was a hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_165.wav	2.95	He had played well in that central role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_166.wav	2.73	And who would argue with that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_167.wav	2.95	It was visibly on fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_168.wav	3.59	What's it for, after all?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_169.wav	2.01	Who would be out there, singing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_170.wav	2.60	A number of people could not speak English.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_171.wav	2.26	They have got off with murder.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_172.wav	3.29	Charges against the pair were found not proven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_173.wav	2.99	This remains the party's policy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_174.wav	2.95	I cannot say anymore.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_175.wav	2.35	They want this research to continue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_176.wav	2.86	Robert is a special talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_177.wav	3.03	They are going to carry it through.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_178.wav	2.31	It was very, very dejected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_179.wav	2.52	You can't keep them separate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_180.wav	3.29	I think it can count against you now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_181.wav	2.91	He was a legend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_182.wav	3.03	That's when the story first appeared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_183.wav	1.92	You're going to die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_184.wav	2.99	There was a substantial explosion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_185.wav	3.50	He will continue to provide support for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_186.wav	5.51	I'm going to see my friend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_187.wav	2.48	We played too deeply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_188.wav	3.93	I probably would have been a dancer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_189.wav	2.69	There is a lot of heroin about.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_190.wav	4.01	We're going to see a Government in a hurry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_191.wav	5.29	He never asked me for money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_192.wav	2.99	I was a bit nervous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_193.wav	3.85	There was no question of him not impressing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_194.wav	2.35	However, we came through.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_195.wav	2.60	I love this tournament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_196.wav	2.27	He had a heart problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_197.wav	2.73	I am desperate to play for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_198.wav	3.03	It is a large number.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_199.wav	3.76	We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_200.wav	2.65	Hear what they have to say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_201.wav	2.52	Now there's a thought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_202.wav	2.61	I believe that the answer is simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_203.wav	2.95	That, he claimed, was essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_204.wav	2.78	I was on the pitch and everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_205.wav	2.65	They told him to go to drama school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_206.wav	3.29	Clearly the impact is going to be negative.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_207.wav	2.14	Let us hope so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_208.wav	2.82	She looked very settled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_209.wav	2.14	Of course he was right!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_210.wav	2.56	The next few months will tell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_211.wav	3.12	It felt like my support system was leaving.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_212.wav	2.94	But my daughter has got nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_213.wav	2.18	You can see their point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_214.wav	3.50	Nobody, if he has anything to do with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_215.wav	2.26	The dangers are very obvious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_216.wav	2.35	There were no casualties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_217.wav	3.42	Is it in the right place?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_218.wav	2.35	I played well in my time there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_219.wav	2.78	A teacher is, really, about unity.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_220.wav	3.12	They are still going to be impulsive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_221.wav	2.48	I love you so very much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_222.wav	3.67	The scheme was simple but extremely effective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_223.wav	2.48	He is a very nice man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_224.wav	2.27	We want to sort it out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_225.wav	2.86	Sean Connery did not disappoint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_226.wav	2.52	Such a city does not exist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_227.wav	2.60	It made me determined to get back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_228.wav	2.52	It was no avail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_229.wav	2.77	We're going to see more extreme weather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_230.wav	2.65	He was replaced by John Spencer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_231.wav	3.12	Of course, we have to be very concerned about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_232.wav	3.59	That is in the very nature of farming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_233.wav	3.16	And, also, when he does not have the ball.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_234.wav	2.30	It was worth the wait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_235.wav	2.73	I love the tradition of vaudeville.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_236.wav	3.03	It will take place in July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_237.wav	3.50	We must not give in to the bastards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_238.wav	3.71	This is a major step forward for carers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_239.wav	2.86	I think it was his parents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_240.wav	3.08	Our commitment is to move forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_241.wav	2.82	Partly, it is his own fault.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_242.wav	2.39	It's a personal matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_243.wav	2.35	That's where it all started.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_244.wav	1.84	I won't go back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_245.wav	2.69	Why has it taken so long?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_246.wav	2.05	You make the choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_247.wav	2.18	And does it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_248.wav	2.18	I was proud of our lads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_249.wav	3.84	These will finally be corrected by next week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_250.wav	3.54	This kind of traffic is commonplace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_251.wav	3.97	All would be under threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_252.wav	2.44	Was it a foul?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_253.wav	2.86	He leaves a beat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_254.wav	2.73	Perhaps it was her demeanour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_255.wav	2.82	It lasted longer than we thought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_256.wav	2.31	Promises were not kept.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_257.wav	3.07	It hasn't happened, but other things have.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_258.wav	3.03	The claim was denied by first minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_259.wav	3.08	Who is he?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_260.wav	3.03	It has to be long-term commitment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_261.wav	3.76	It was that bad, that low.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_262.wav	3.63	That would be a big mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_263.wav	2.50	His arrival could be the making of them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_264.wav	3.20	After all, this is the start of the giving age.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_265.wav	2.73	I said How much?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_266.wav	1.97	You are a liar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_267.wav	3.55	The scheme has been funded by the Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_268.wav	2.30	We're still talking about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_269.wav	2.77	She would say he was still the best.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_270.wav	2.01	He finished the night in a cell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_271.wav	1.96	I'm not afraid of that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_272.wav	2.56	I don't know what he was shouting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_273.wav	2.90	It is the icing on the cake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_274.wav	2.22	It was a new ball game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_275.wav	2.56	The people here are quite reserved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_276.wav	3.54	Previously police had said that schools were safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_277.wav	2.43	Our legal advice is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_278.wav	3.03	The past is history, not destiny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_279.wav	3.59	These were the edited highlights.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_280.wav	2.78	All were within range of Israeli cities.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_281.wav	2.01	They were totally behind it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_282.wav	3.20	However, it is believed they were from the Highlands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_283.wav	2.31	We could do a lot worse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_284.wav	2.52	Knowledge is everything at this level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_285.wav	3.33	Inquiries are ongoing into this incident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_286.wav	2.05	It is all one-sided.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_287.wav	3.16	In the end, that was enough to beat England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_288.wav	2.26	That was the initial attraction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_289.wav	2.35	Who will take them after that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_290.wav	2.86	He's also thinking long-term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_291.wav	3.93	A kinder but effective treatment would be welcomed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_292.wav	2.35	Trevor has been great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_293.wav	2.31	It would also take time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_294.wav	2.82	Rather than answer, she resigned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_295.wav	3.33	She said No, he's not in Elgin today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_296.wav	2.77	I was first in the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_297.wav	2.39	It is highly unlikely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_298.wav	2.26	Bill is a mentor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_299.wav	2.56	The atmosphere is businesslike.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_300.wav	2.65	I have fallen in love with the Highlands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_301.wav	2.95	There will be no exceptions to this rule.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_302.wav	2.35	What makes a house a home?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_303.wav	2.65	Destruction came from within.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_304.wav	3.16	I think however, he was having a fit!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_305.wav	2.90	It is good to look back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_306.wav	2.77	You can't do one without the other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_307.wav	2.26	Obviously we want to stop the rot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_308.wav	2.69	Chris Paterson was outstanding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_309.wav	3.12	The casting of her husband was an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_310.wav	2.05	I would say so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_311.wav	2.95	It's not the end of the matter, of course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_312.wav	3.03	Sub Not Used, McKay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_313.wav	2.39	And they did just that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_314.wav	3.16	You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_315.wav	2.82	She has left the island.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_316.wav	2.05	They had three children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_317.wav	2.22	Our system is archaic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_318.wav	2.01	She had kept the news from him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_319.wav	2.61	We want to know about the policy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_320.wav	2.39	It is not illegal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_321.wav	2.44	I wouldn't say this is normal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_322.wav	2.69	We don't have the credible evidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_323.wav	2.35	That will be the case on Tuesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_324.wav	2.39	It's one up to the Scots.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_325.wav	2.56	This is complete nonsense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_326.wav	2.48	I don't want to use the term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_327.wav	2.09	There is still hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_328.wav	2.95	It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_329.wav	2.69	It's all happening at a local level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_330.wav	2.13	She is a great talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_331.wav	1.67	It's the big omission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_332.wav	3.41	We do things in an appropriate way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_334.wav	3.42	However, she is female, and so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_335.wav	3.75	The playing is perfectly turned out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_336.wav	4.19	He will be advised by me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_337.wav	3.29	But he did not rule out further talks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_338.wav	1.63	It's part of your life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_339.wav	1.97	He had a horror.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_340.wav	3.12	We're delighted and we certainly deserved it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_341.wav	3.54	This time we may not be seeking volunteers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_342.wav	3.29	That was the biggest game of my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_343.wav	2.65	This is perfectly legal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_344.wav	2.74	That's the most important thing for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_345.wav	2.35	Then came the second round.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_346.wav	3.33	Quite simply, no-one else is willing to do so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_347.wav	3.03	Saddam is not threatening this country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_348.wav	2.26	We told them in June.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_349.wav	2.26	Parents should avoid it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_350.wav	3.37	It was not a difficult decision, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_351.wav	2.82	It was a horrible thing to happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_352.wav	2.43	And she's not even in the book!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_353.wav	2.43	Of course it's a bunch of trouble.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_354.wav	3.59	I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_355.wav	2.52	He, too, is killing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_356.wav	2.89	Bin Laden is believed to be left-handed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_357.wav	2.82	It's better to be happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_358.wav	3.63	It's just so sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_359.wav	3.59	We have lost the round, but not the fight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_360.wav	2.31	And Scotland is no different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_361.wav	3.33	It's been an extremely frustrating year for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_362.wav	2.48	We are in a learning curve.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_363.wav	2.05	He can do everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_364.wav	2.73	She was just that sort of person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_365.wav	3.12	Is it a warning to parents?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_366.wav	2.99	You've gotten all the facts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_367.wav	5.25	And it will be even more difficult tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_368.wav	2.78	Soon the whole country will be level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_369.wav	2.82	And huge, indeed, it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_370.wav	3.16	I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_371.wav	2.95	Attack appears to be the biggest concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_372.wav	3.38	For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_373.wav	3.29	He said he needed no more evidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_374.wav	2.69	It's such a tragedy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_375.wav	2.61	It was a long time coming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_376.wav	2.22	Gordon Brown was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_377.wav	3.16	The referee didn't do his job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_378.wav	2.56	We are very nearly there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_379.wav	3.16	Stand by for action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_380.wav	2.43	Barry will be able to handle this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_381.wav	2.99	However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_382.wav	2.39	The urgency is real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_383.wav	2.86	They have been for some time now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_384.wav	2.56	It was only logical to end it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_385.wav	2.39	Yet the consensus is, it's worth it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_386.wav	2.86	I've no passion for any country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_387.wav	2.27	Scotland needs to hear it, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_388.wav	2.65	Nobody ever gets to see them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_389.wav	2.05	That's an old idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_390.wav	2.65	It is part and parcel of it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_391.wav	3.50	The only safe investment is cash.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_392.wav	2.25	It's the whole season.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_393.wav	3.93	We had no choice but to go down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_394.wav	2.31	We are keen to have him back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_395.wav	5.89	This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_396.wav	2.52	Of course, it was very passionate in Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_397.wav	2.90	And we all understand that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_398.wav	2.77	The new incitement offence will cover all religions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_399.wav	3.03	Clearly, the future remains uncertain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_400.wav	3.41	Do what you have to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_401.wav	2.52	We must do well in that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_402.wav	1.84	She died later on Monday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_403.wav	3.12	No-one has yet been charged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_404.wav	2.74	If so, they were wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_405.wav	2.73	This is my big break.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_406.wav	2.01	It was meant to rival the dollar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_407.wav	2.78	There is no easy answer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_408.wav	2.65	There was someone on the floor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_409.wav	2.78	I put pressure on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_410.wav	3.37	He supported the decision to review the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_411.wav	3.24	It was chaotic and frightening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_412.wav	2.99	Friday night was a pretty good night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_413.wav	2.91	He will never walk the streets again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_414.wav	3.46	The proposals have been taken out of context.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_415.wav	2.22	Golf has lost a great character.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_416.wav	3.76	However, it has had only a limited uptake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_417.wav	5.46	I have to say, for me, the game was not.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_418.wav	3.16	However, the report was incorrect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p312\p312_419.wav	2.86	There was no pressure at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_001.wav	2.48	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_002.wav	5.08	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_003.wav	11.18	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_004.wav	6.49	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_005.wav	8.28	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_006.wav	7.94	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_007.wav	6.36	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_008.wav	8.58	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_009.wav	5.72	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_010.wav	5.08	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_011.wav	8.96	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_012.wav	7.26	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_013.wav	7.34	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_014.wav	5.42	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_015.wav	6.53	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_016.wav	7.26	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_017.wav	6.10	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_018.wav	7.68	Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_019.wav	7.73	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_020.wav	5.98	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_021.wav	9.86	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the sizes of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_022.wav	9.09	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_023.wav	14.30	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_024.wav	11.90	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_025.wav	2.52	They will be dealt with.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_026.wav	2.90	It is never an easy game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_027.wav	3.50	This year it will be Billy Crystal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_028.wav	3.37	I intend to raise the matter there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_029.wav	4.14	However, it's good to turn the page.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_030.wav	3.29	We have to put this behind us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_031.wav	3.67	I thought it was quite good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_032.wav	3.63	It was important to win the singles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_033.wav	4.01	This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_034.wav	3.72	That is impressive by any standards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_035.wav	3.41	We are doing very well as we are.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_036.wav	4.48	The waiting is over, well almost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_037.wav	5.76	This was the performance, and the result they needed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_038.wav	5.29	I'm not allowed to say that, of course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_039.wav	3.41	It helped me to get noticed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_040.wav	3.29	They hit me in the head.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_041.wav	2.78	But he is not using them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_042.wav	3.41	That, though, was just the start of it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_043.wav	4.27	We are not moving in.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_044.wav	3.50	We have not had a formal request.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_045.wav	3.12	I never had a childhood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_046.wav	3.33	Its effect on humans is not yet known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_047.wav	3.24	We offered something different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_048.wav	3.84	We were very much a happy family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_049.wav	6.53	He was critically ill in hospital last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_050.wav	2.95	My brother's buried under there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_051.wav	4.44	Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_052.wav	2.69	What were they?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_053.wav	3.46	It was large enough to fit the wall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_054.wav	3.63	He will be judged by his actions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_055.wav	3.29	Her role in it was small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_056.wav	2.86	I've really noticed that this week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_057.wav	3.37	We might be back next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_058.wav	2.52	In a way he was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_059.wav	4.14	It's back to how it used to be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_060.wav	3.42	It is not a standing army.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_061.wav	4.23	The firm was down and almost out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_062.wav	4.23	They said they were only young men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_063.wav	3.76	I was chosen to do this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_064.wav	3.50	I learned a lot from that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_065.wav	3.63	The house was so well alight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_066.wav	3.84	He got his degree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_067.wav	4.23	Sandy was very active.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_068.wav	5.12	However, there is great potential in this right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_069.wav	4.01	We have no idea what caused the derailment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_070.wav	3.08	I'm confident of the outcome this week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_071.wav	3.33	There were no formal announcements.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_072.wav	4.06	Before the games it was pretty open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_073.wav	4.10	It really has left the town in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_074.wav	4.10	But you can go beyond that condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_075.wav	4.23	I'm so worried about the roads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_076.wav	3.03	This was much worse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_077.wav	4.57	He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_078.wav	4.10	We are confident of taking that back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_079.wav	3.67	They must be kept on the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_080.wav	3.33	Did they give any good advice?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_081.wav	2.74	Who wants to be a millionaire?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_082.wav	3.25	This does not help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_083.wav	5.59	I've invented a village in East Lothian.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_084.wav	4.27	That's why the ministers resigned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_085.wav	3.88	He has lost confidence and weight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_086.wav	4.82	This process of attrition is expected to continue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_087.wav	4.78	Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_088.wav	3.16	This could be her way forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_089.wav	3.29	This gives us a lot of practice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_090.wav	4.52	The Parliament will make its own decisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_091.wav	5.47	It's a very, very special day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_092.wav	4.65	The crucial strike was yet to come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_093.wav	5.64	There's also the point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_094.wav	3.03	It was forced to divert.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_095.wav	4.40	Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_096.wav	4.10	That's the National Grid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_097.wav	3.71	But Allen is deadly serious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_098.wav	3.63	Peter doesn't want to leave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_099.wav	3.84	He wouldn't allow that to happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_100.wav	3.76	They've just got to believe in themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_101.wav	3.63	This is my personal assessment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_102.wav	3.16	There was no trouble at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_103.wav	9.52	Although, you never know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_104.wav	3.63	We shall be victorious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_105.wav	4.52	The quality of work is very impressive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_106.wav	4.36	However, he added there were signs of progress.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_107.wav	3.89	Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_108.wav	4.74	I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_109.wav	4.27	Nothing is being offered in exchange.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_110.wav	2.77	I took the gun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_111.wav	5.89	It's just one of those things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_112.wav	3.59	A web site is planned for November.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_113.wav	3.63	We played so well at times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_114.wav	4.10	I was very fortunate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_115.wav	3.63	Such a policy would be a disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_116.wav	4.36	We act because we must.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_117.wav	7.85	They will be destroyed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_118.wav	4.01	We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_119.wav	5.08	O Neill is reputed to have replied.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_120.wav	2.48	The Tory party will last.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_121.wav	4.23	It was a journey into a new life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_122.wav	3.97	It's a way of making a mark.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_123.wav	3.67	There is a great carry over value.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_124.wav	4.10	Life, as many people know it, in other words.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_125.wav	3.41	I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_126.wav	3.80	What's the point?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_127.wav	4.10	Why is this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_128.wav	2.56	What has changed since then?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_129.wav	4.14	Raymond was always on the outside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_130.wav	4.10	We need to make more inquiries about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_131.wav	3.76	I'd love to be at the World Cup.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_132.wav	5.34	He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_133.wav	2.52	I'm sorry to hear this news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_134.wav	3.33	At some point, the bill will be presented.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_135.wav	3.08	I mean it happens.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_136.wav	4.74	This week is a perfect example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_137.wav	5.21	This performance has given my confidence a boost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_138.wav	3.97	Receiving this medal is an honour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_139.wav	3.07	Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_140.wav	3.63	But every two minutes it was exploding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_141.wav	3.20	That sort of thing is long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_142.wav	2.60	It's typical of me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_143.wav	4.31	However, consumers may take a different view.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_144.wav	2.90	They played it like a cup final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_145.wav	3.38	However, it's not all bad news for women.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_146.wav	6.40	But the championship is not over yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_147.wav	3.38	We haven't found out anything different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_148.wav	3.89	A review of the decision is being sought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_149.wav	4.78	It will be about commitment, not compliance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_150.wav	3.97	Still, in the end, it was a fair result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_151.wav	3.67	Surely it can do better than that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_152.wav	2.47	I am ashamed of them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_153.wav	3.50	Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_154.wav	3.88	The salary changes are long overdue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_155.wav	4.05	I, like an idiot, agreed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_156.wav	3.63	If so, we want to hear from them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_157.wav	3.50	I'm not blaming audiences.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_158.wav	2.69	Who was on the panel?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_159.wav	3.93	They may differ on other issues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_160.wav	3.12	He'd never run the distance before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_161.wav	3.72	I can make one further announcement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_162.wav	3.41	The General Election is all to play for.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_163.wav	2.82	It was a fiery game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_164.wav	3.29	Agents and coaches must be paid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_165.wav	3.67	Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_166.wav	3.50	Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_167.wav	2.78	It will not be easy for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_168.wav	3.16	This one is a special case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_169.wav	2.52	But what are the songs about?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_170.wav	3.16	There is a simmering anger out there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_171.wav	3.62	The ministers are now to make their decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_172.wav	3.20	That is not a position they enjoy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_173.wav	2.52	The stadium was full.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_174.wav	2.82	Dewar is the medium.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_175.wav	2.78	It was that kind of night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_176.wav	3.03	It is very much a matter for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_177.wav	2.99	Perhaps it is jealousy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_178.wav	3.41	Any error is severely punished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_179.wav	3.42	He's got a great chance of making it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_180.wav	2.69	We won't do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_181.wav	2.95	I hope we do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_182.wav	3.93	From now on there is no hiding place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_183.wav	3.08	I didn't want to ignore the punters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_184.wav	2.09	He quit in October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_185.wav	2.95	The United Nations must act.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_186.wav	2.82	Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_187.wav	2.31	Her daughter is getting married.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_188.wav	2.95	His manager blamed the referee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_189.wav	2.13	They were that poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_190.wav	3.59	Patients will be partners in decision making.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_191.wav	3.11	We have understood the problems for some time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_192.wav	3.89	Stan is a vital part of our future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_193.wav	2.82	All these things have an impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_194.wav	3.24	That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_195.wav	2.22	They believed it worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_196.wav	3.16	After that, though, we're still waiting to see.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_197.wav	2.73	They should feel ashamed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_198.wav	2.61	This is a really serious issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_199.wav	2.69	So they will settle again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_200.wav	3.33	How do we get more people in?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_201.wav	3.72	I'm just looking to take my chances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_202.wav	2.91	It looks as though there is no chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_203.wav	3.89	This is not a European Army.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_204.wav	2.95	Election results are expected soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_205.wav	2.65	So she told him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_206.wav	4.14	A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_207.wav	2.86	There are moments of honesty, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_208.wav	2.77	It was good to score the goal today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_209.wav	1.88	The night is young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_210.wav	3.16	Sadly, too, many of them are similar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_211.wav	2.90	I suspect that it will.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_212.wav	3.42	But there's no eye contact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_213.wav	3.16	The squad will be the same for France.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_214.wav	4.22	We are a party for people, not against people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_215.wav	3.80	Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_216.wav	2.78	We're still paying the price for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_217.wav	3.42	He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_218.wav	2.56	It's not a wish list.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_219.wav	3.24	He's very, very lucky to be alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_220.wav	3.46	Some of the players have not progressed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_221.wav	3.80	It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_222.wav	3.54	If not, he should go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_223.wav	4.36	We remain committed to it, as does the government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_224.wav	2.82	There is no margin for error.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_225.wav	3.16	This was not an easy meeting for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_226.wav	3.20	From our point of view, it's the right time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_227.wav	3.03	That figure will always remain with me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_228.wav	2.73	And then a funny thing happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_229.wav	2.65	It doesn't take much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_230.wav	2.86	She asked us a lot of questions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_231.wav	2.86	It was a stunning strike.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_232.wav	2.52	It is a technique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_233.wav	3.24	They hold on for many years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_234.wav	3.16	Is it the shape of things to come?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_235.wav	3.20	My body is exhausted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_236.wav	3.84	Home is in the Scottish Borders.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_237.wav	3.84	We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_238.wav	3.12	There is nothing to fear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_239.wav	2.14	I was an athlete.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_240.wav	2.73	Life was like a timetable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_241.wav	3.25	World leaders expressed their sympathy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_242.wav	2.69	I tried to push him away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_243.wav	4.48	It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_244.wav	3.84	This was done by the council staff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_245.wav	2.86	The truth is otherwise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_246.wav	2.73	We haven't come out of this very well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_247.wav	3.29	I wanted to put myself on the line.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_248.wav	3.63	I thought they could have made the gesture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_249.wav	4.78	We should be rewarded for producing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_250.wav	3.37	The bottom line is that this must stop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_251.wav	13.02	Which, in effect, it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_252.wav	3.08	The man became a reporter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_253.wav	2.82	It is a memorial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_254.wav	3.33	We feel it sends out the wrong message.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_255.wav	2.86	Our people are paying high prices.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_256.wav	3.33	The reason is partly because of tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_257.wav	3.67	Nor is it likely to do so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_258.wav	2.52	Or so everyone believed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_259.wav	2.94	Perhaps we should do the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_260.wav	2.26	I read it every year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_261.wav	3.33	He was in contention almost every week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_262.wav	3.29	Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_263.wav	2.14	It's up to Ann.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_264.wav	3.33	We are playing them at their own game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_265.wav	4.23	By this point the couple were approaching fast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_266.wav	3.03	I had trouble with the producers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_267.wav	3.08	So, it took me back to boarding school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_268.wav	3.33	They just thought it was extremely good acting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_269.wav	2.86	The conference is the first test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_270.wav	2.44	That's what we're trying to achieve.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_271.wav	2.82	I expect a rapid response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_272.wav	3.20	There was still more disquiet in Israel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_273.wav	2.39	There is no more money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_274.wav	2.26	My mother is a widow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_275.wav	3.20	The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_276.wav	3.42	There have been different reports from different people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_277.wav	3.20	It's an absolute disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_278.wav	4.31	Something was plainly wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_279.wav	6.32	Why should he go anywhere?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_280.wav	3.93	One thing is sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_281.wav	4.74	It was a foolhardy decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_282.wav	2.35	I'm confident we can do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_283.wav	6.06	Funding needs to be long term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_284.wav	3.63	It's funny how it comes and goes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_285.wav	4.91	I would never even consider it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_286.wav	3.00	We're talking about the outskirts of London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_287.wav	4.31	The end result is precisely the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_288.wav	3.33	We have it on video.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_289.wav	2.99	I'm not a threat to coaches.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_290.wav	3.88	Painful, but only because it's true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_291.wav	3.93	It's never over until it's over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_292.wav	4.02	Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_293.wav	3.12	This year, it was a little different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_294.wav	2.99	That, though, is to miss the point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_295.wav	2.52	We gave them the goal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_296.wav	3.46	Is being naturally funny enough?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_297.wav	2.95	What's the point of staying sober?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_298.wav	2.95	We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_299.wav	3.80	The incident is being taken seriously.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_300.wav	3.54	So what's the shape, and what's the detail?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_301.wav	3.63	They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_302.wav	3.29	I can feel the sound inside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_303.wav	3.76	I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_304.wav	2.78	I'm not a fan of books.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_305.wav	3.07	SO now we know the secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_306.wav	2.60	It may well have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_307.wav	3.76	I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_308.wav	2.77	It was a simple question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_309.wav	3.59	I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_310.wav	3.03	And we've beaten them before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_311.wav	4.01	Could you put it in writing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_312.wav	2.86	I'm not a paedophile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_313.wav	3.29	Some of their movement was excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_314.wav	2.43	But they had to be paid for.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_315.wav	2.78	The odds are that it will.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_316.wav	2.69	But then they scored their fourth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_317.wav	2.73	They deserve a lot of credit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_318.wav	3.46	That's the position that the MoD has adopted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_319.wav	2.01	Why is that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_320.wav	2.86	Then came the crunch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_321.wav	4.44	But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_322.wav	3.16	But will they fall in love?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_323.wav	2.86	As if they ever stopped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_324.wav	3.42	The referee had a shocking game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_325.wav	3.42	Players are fighting to stay in the team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_326.wav	2.30	For a few years we had good fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_327.wav	2.95	Medical staff are with them at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_328.wav	3.29	It went on to become an annual event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_329.wav	4.14	This is the logic of punishment assaults.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_330.wav	3.07	We are now in an election period.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_331.wav	3.63	Everyone's too upset to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_332.wav	3.46	Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_333.wav	2.65	But when we do it is great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_334.wav	3.29	She has nothing to say to journalists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_335.wav	3.03	I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_336.wav	2.78	He pleaded for caution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_339.wav	2.91	I can't believe the buzz.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_340.wav	2.69	I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_341.wav	3.89	The picture is the same across Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_342.wav	2.69	When it comes down to it, this is a job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_343.wav	3.33	It's no less intriguing, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_344.wav	3.12	It's a question of perception.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_345.wav	2.86	Staff have been informed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_346.wav	3.54	My heart is not so sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_347.wav	3.37	This morning was very quiet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_348.wav	3.46	On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_349.wav	3.20	It's been handled entirely properly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_350.wav	3.80	I shall be voting Yes to support him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_351.wav	3.03	That might help a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_352.wav	3.67	Two others were also seriously injured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_353.wav	3.80	He was made redundant in February of last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_354.wav	3.16	Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_355.wav	4.31	Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_356.wav	2.65	You've obviously got an answer to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_357.wav	2.01	It seems very odd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_358.wav	2.61	Closure is not one of them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_359.wav	2.01	The hotel was huge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_360.wav	4.10	A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_361.wav	2.86	Well, you can have a tree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_362.wav	2.65	It was the same at Twickenham.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_363.wav	2.61	This is an internal matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_364.wav	2.52	I'm amazed at what he's done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_365.wav	2.27	They took a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_366.wav	2.65	The idea was presented to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_367.wav	2.95	The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_368.wav	4.10	He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_369.wav	4.14	His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_370.wav	2.56	The hearing was fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_371.wav	2.27	I see it as my job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_372.wav	2.90	This was not a summit about the euro.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_373.wav	2.95	Frank Warren is a great man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_374.wav	2.35	I'm a little bit tired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_375.wav	2.78	That was never their agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_376.wav	2.35	She died at her home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_377.wav	2.65	She's currently in foster care.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_378.wav	2.61	That's the only thing that matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_379.wav	2.69	I enjoy the creative process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_380.wav	3.76	They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_381.wav	3.54	It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_382.wav	3.50	As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_383.wav	3.63	It's always the same, isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_384.wav	3.55	We have been preparing all year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_385.wav	2.90	We could learn a lot from them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_386.wav	2.99	I can't wait for the outdoors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_387.wav	3.50	Sure, we have problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_388.wav	5.21	I was released after six days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_389.wav	5.51	That time is not far away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_390.wav	2.90	I may think about performing it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_391.wav	3.12	There are a number of possible outcomes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_392.wav	3.12	We also enjoyed a lot of support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_393.wav	3.20	This is the last thing we ever expected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_394.wav	2.99	You can't go back and change things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_395.wav	3.12	It's time to fight a decisive battle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_396.wav	3.08	Of course, it is a tough assignment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_397.wav	3.50	Instead, it's back to the drawing board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_398.wav	2.56	He says it often enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_399.wav	4.01	Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_400.wav	3.67	His primary residence is Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_401.wav	3.20	I found that much more challenging.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_402.wav	3.16	This fight is not going to go away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_403.wav	3.25	It would have been very easily done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_404.wav	3.25	I will never manage another Scottish club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_405.wav	2.90	The Open champion is back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_406.wav	3.03	It's going to be a new challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_407.wav	3.07	As, indeed, they would be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_408.wav	2.22	I want to keep him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_409.wav	2.61	He deserves a top team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_410.wav	2.26	I knew people on that committee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_411.wav	2.86	The next eight weeks are critical to us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_412.wav	2.86	Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_413.wav	2.73	Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_414.wav	2.48	We never agreed to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_415.wav	3.54	But that night they killed her housekeeper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_416.wav	2.99	But it's not the end of Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_417.wav	3.25	Sightings were replaced by rumours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_418.wav	2.26	Would they work together again?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_419.wav	2.39	I didn't play all that well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_420.wav	1.71	Who can tell?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_421.wav	2.73	It appears to have been closed down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_422.wav	2.48	Now, that is a good deal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p313\p313_423.wav	2.69	The whole nation will be delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_001.wav	2.16	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_002.wav	4.10	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_003.wav	6.19	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_004.wav	4.70	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_005.wav	6.28	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_006.wav	6.19	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_007.wav	5.59	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_008.wav	7.86	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_009.wav	5.55	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_010.wav	3.16	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_011.wav	7.51	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_012.wav	4.87	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_013.wav	4.87	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_014.wav	5.33	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_015.wav	6.53	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_016.wav	7.25	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_017.wav	3.51	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_018.wav	6.87	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_019.wav	7.94	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_020.wav	5.08	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_021.wav	9.30	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_022.wav	7.34	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_023.wav	11.29	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_024.wav	7.81	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_025.wav	4.14	The Scots are, however, in good company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_026.wav	4.23	He was born in London of Scottish parents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_027.wav	3.97	Her condition last night was described as critical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_028.wav	3.89	Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_029.wav	3.41	Four other charges were dropped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_030.wav	2.82	I believe in the Church.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_031.wav	3.12	We are just being flooded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_032.wav	4.74	It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_033.wav	4.18	They tend to be easily influenced by others.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_034.wav	4.31	It's about bringing people in, breaking down barriers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_035.wav	2.99	Well, what do you know?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_036.wav	3.16	But she was very human.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_037.wav	4.83	There are some serious ethical issues involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_038.wav	5.38	If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_039.wav	3.55	His concern is only for the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_040.wav	3.42	We have reacted well to each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_041.wav	3.84	Pupils and staff were sent home early.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_042.wav	4.70	It is all about people being assaulted, abused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_043.wav	3.93	I'm delighted with how he has come through.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_044.wav	4.23	In fact, he didn't deliver a speech at the awards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_045.wav	3.29	He will emerge as a world leader.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_046.wav	2.99	That view has not altered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_047.wav	2.95	I only half believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_048.wav	5.55	It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_049.wav	4.14	All the oil companies are talking together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_050.wav	3.29	We have no choice but to shut down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_051.wav	2.86	I'm feeling pretty good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_052.wav	3.16	The prognosis is excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_053.wav	3.12	Rangers deserved to beat us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_054.wav	3.67	That, though, is the measure of the man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_055.wav	2.78	It was developed in the Gulf War.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_056.wav	4.18	Sub Not Used, MacKay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_057.wav	2.78	It is not normal practice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_058.wav	4.27	But he just carried on anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_059.wav	3.88	The spirit in the squad is certainly good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_060.wav	3.16	What happens next?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_061.wav	3.07	I would not want to be young again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_062.wav	5.04	Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_063.wav	3.42	I'm astonished the men were not injured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_064.wav	2.95	There are schoolboys in uniform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_065.wav	5.89	Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_066.wav	4.02	They were later discharged from hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_067.wav	4.31	Let's see that increase over the years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_068.wav	4.01	I've learned a lot, and tomorrow is another day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_069.wav	3.33	They knew they shouldn't have been there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_070.wav	3.63	These findings would be made public.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_071.wav	3.50	It's the most beautiful place on earth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_072.wav	4.95	I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_073.wav	3.33	You can't go on forever.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_074.wav	4.14	All the lads are totally focused on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_075.wav	4.78	So far this season this approach is working.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_076.wav	3.16	I have got a knife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_077.wav	4.36	If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_078.wav	2.56	What did we learn?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_079.wav	3.54	I go home only once.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_080.wav	3.38	I'm not going to answer that right now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_081.wav	4.10	It had a gigantic effect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_082.wav	3.76	On that basis, he would set it aside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_083.wav	5.55	I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_084.wav	3.63	Bin Laden was not mentioned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_085.wav	4.87	Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_086.wav	3.93	The team this year is going places.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_087.wav	3.63	It opens the door to the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_088.wav	3.63	We should do everything at a stroke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_089.wav	2.77	He had a moustache.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_090.wav	3.59	He has changed my life for ever.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_091.wav	3.63	It plans to return to this field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_092.wav	3.55	He said because people had invited him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_093.wav	3.29	Action must be taken urgently.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_094.wav	3.33	They are completely different from each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_095.wav	4.48	The money is not really our concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_096.wav	3.07	Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_097.wav	4.06	Correction, knowing him, he might.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_098.wav	3.20	I came up through the ranks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_099.wav	4.57	Why does she suddenly win everything now?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_100.wav	3.88	His team management was protective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_101.wav	4.10	He was the deputy editor at the paper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_102.wav	2.56	The proposal was rejected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_103.wav	4.14	First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_104.wav	4.53	We wanted it left for a wee while.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_105.wav	3.59	That would be even more disastrous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_106.wav	2.77	These guys will not lie down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_107.wav	3.03	You can expect a hell of a fuss.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_108.wav	3.33	Harrowing is easy, after all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_109.wav	3.67	That is nearly four people every day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_110.wav	2.82	There are nine people here now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_111.wav	2.69	Is my wife a racist?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_112.wav	3.85	It is a pity, but you can't have everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_113.wav	2.95	This would not be my first choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_114.wav	3.29	His wife Margaret was not in court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_115.wav	4.83	Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_116.wav	3.11	Which perhaps is just as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_117.wav	4.19	It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_118.wav	3.25	He would just say it was terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_119.wav	4.06	They have got their position, we have got our position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_120.wav	3.03	That's not fair to the supporters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_121.wav	3.97	I saw military vehicles in the distance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_122.wav	2.82	But the killer remains at large.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_123.wav	2.78	It is a great shame.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_124.wav	3.12	There are a lot of examples.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_125.wav	2.52	But it will backfire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_126.wav	2.99	But then he changed his mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_127.wav	3.50	I really hope he thinks that through.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_128.wav	3.25	Police were also perplexed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_129.wav	3.67	For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_130.wav	3.46	It's very tragic and traumatic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_131.wav	3.54	For me, it's a tension you can feel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_132.wav	2.69	That's a huge amount.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_133.wav	3.16	The final stage is paranoia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_134.wav	3.33	I'm not holding the club to ransom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_135.wav	5.04	Her advice for Glasgow is just be visionary.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_136.wav	2.99	Folk music is in her blood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_137.wav	3.67	Pig farmers are completely despondent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_138.wav	3.46	They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_139.wav	3.97	We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_140.wav	2.60	I would love it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_141.wav	3.55	This is the high point of my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_142.wav	2.69	That's the sort of game you want.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_143.wav	3.08	My duty is to win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_144.wav	3.37	Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_145.wav	3.25	We are trying to clarify the issues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_146.wav	2.31	Now we look forward to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_147.wav	2.48	There is no such thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_148.wav	3.33	We've had an enjoyable adventure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_149.wav	3.12	He was telling me to keep quiet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_150.wav	4.78	It was a moment of madness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_151.wav	2.82	Don't even bother applying.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_152.wav	3.71	But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_153.wav	3.20	We like being the underdogs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_154.wav	3.55	We haven't seen from the Bank of Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_155.wav	3.67	But we are not immune to the problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_156.wav	3.42	Racism has no place in any sport.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_157.wav	3.07	It's all too short term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_158.wav	4.06	It is believed she had serious head injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_159.wav	2.35	We must move on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_160.wav	3.97	Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_161.wav	4.44	We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_162.wav	3.80	The pilot was making a visual approach.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_163.wav	2.86	I'd say we should give it a week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_164.wav	3.59	The elections should have no role in this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_165.wav	3.16	I should not be able to stand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_166.wav	4.18	Many other Scottish locations also feature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_167.wav	3.67	Little Voice is on general release.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_168.wav	3.46	Frankly, it was worth the booking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_169.wav	3.20	That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_170.wav	2.56	They've got to get better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_171.wav	4.48	He realises he has hit a glass ceiling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_172.wav	3.67	This is good news for the Western Isles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_173.wav	2.82	We've got the top three.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_174.wav	3.20	I was never alone with her, right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_175.wav	2.82	There is no substitute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_176.wav	2.86	That nation is South Africa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_177.wav	3.41	This will secure the future of our industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_178.wav	2.99	It's just a normal life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_179.wav	3.89	However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_180.wav	3.71	I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_181.wav	3.59	Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_182.wav	3.20	That's when you hope to take advantage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_183.wav	3.03	He is the example for all of us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_184.wav	3.97	There is no way to do this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_185.wav	3.12	It was an empowering journey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_186.wav	3.93	Clearly we were looking at this very carefully.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_187.wav	3.67	I certainly do not agree with that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_188.wav	3.50	It was a disaster of a race.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_189.wav	3.20	It's not unlike the millennium bug.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_190.wav	3.16	No, it's never been mentioned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_191.wav	3.71	They had been together for about three years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_192.wav	2.91	O Neill has delivered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_193.wav	3.07	That is a trend which will be encouraged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_194.wav	4.02	What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_195.wav	2.91	Our customers come first.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_196.wav	3.25	We will reform the welfare state.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_197.wav	3.54	It may be his last for a while, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_198.wav	3.03	His director of football is leaving.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_199.wav	4.40	Mixing drugs and alcohol can be extremely dangerous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_200.wav	4.95	The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_201.wav	4.27	He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_202.wav	2.82	We don't want to be too intrusive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_203.wav	2.65	We just want to get stuck in now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_204.wav	2.60	Drugs are getting through.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_205.wav	2.65	Do you come from Moscow?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_206.wav	3.63	He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_207.wav	2.82	That night was a terrible muddle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_208.wav	3.50	We are aware of the tribunal case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_209.wav	2.18	You saw the football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_210.wav	4.87	Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_211.wav	4.40	He added,  It is all about the search for power.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_212.wav	4.18	But he was a full, working member of our staff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_213.wav	3.03	I am a little bit tired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_214.wav	2.86	Broke the birdie record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_215.wav	3.38	We have an attorney on the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_216.wav	2.48	I looked forward to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_217.wav	2.90	That was a disgraceful performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_218.wav	2.56	I'd come back from London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_219.wav	2.99	That it is a brand name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_220.wav	2.39	She was an only child.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_221.wav	2.78	The text is reduced to bubbles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_222.wav	2.31	They should come forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_223.wav	3.29	We don't say there was a massacre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_224.wav	3.72	John Lennon is a very large industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_225.wav	3.76	The island will never recover.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_226.wav	3.25	That is not an easy thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_227.wav	4.06	Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_228.wav	4.01	Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_229.wav	3.84	Three weeks later, he resigned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_230.wav	3.20	It is a court case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_231.wav	3.12	She was a delightful person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_232.wav	2.52	The next one comes up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_233.wav	3.54	This fact is supported by audience research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_234.wav	3.67	Of further privacy, he had no need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_235.wav	3.71	Come to that, is any of this really happening?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_236.wav	3.37	Both sides have to step back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_237.wav	2.77	This is wonderful news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_238.wav	3.03	Is he going to look after them?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_239.wav	4.91	But if they were there, they were keeping a low profile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_240.wav	4.23	They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_241.wav	3.46	Obviously, we would want to look at this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_242.wav	2.86	We are ready for the long haul.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_243.wav	6.40	I was just getting over the time difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_244.wav	3.46	I don't have any answer for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_245.wav	3.46	I look for dancers who are also actors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_246.wav	4.78	However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_247.wav	3.29	The death toll included five children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_248.wav	3.80	EMI is a prime example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_249.wav	3.76	I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_250.wav	3.33	And what is she escaping from?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_251.wav	3.41	You cannot allow it to go on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_252.wav	4.61	A Scottish film studio is also being considered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_253.wav	3.42	Not that Agassi was a believer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_254.wav	3.25	A friendship that will endure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_255.wav	3.93	Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_256.wav	3.20	It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_257.wav	2.52	That will not change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_258.wav	3.89	He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_259.wav	3.42	I thought that all musicians were the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_260.wav	3.54	I am deeply sorry they did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_261.wav	4.61	Nowadays, it is workers united.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_262.wav	4.48	Asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_263.wav	2.35	Who would have thought it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_264.wav	3.20	He is young but not too young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_265.wav	3.89	I played well on Saturday and again today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_266.wav	3.97	Lara is very, very much a girl.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_267.wav	4.48	He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_268.wav	3.25	I took a minibus into town.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_269.wav	3.46	They've been at it for five hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_270.wav	3.12	I'm not talking about his career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_271.wav	2.69	I watched a game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_272.wav	4.44	That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_273.wav	4.35	Blair is very positive at European Councils.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_274.wav	4.87	Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_275.wav	3.03	He has lost confidence and weight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_276.wav	3.29	Intensive care has been very busy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_277.wav	3.37	There was no let-up for the minnows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_278.wav	3.80	Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_279.wav	2.74	It could be a danger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_280.wav	2.56	This is my home town.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_281.wav	3.03	His English counterpart agreed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_282.wav	3.29	We will build upon the basic state pension.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_283.wav	3.63	Nothing can bring back their son.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_284.wav	4.53	It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_285.wav	3.50	It's part of the game, isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_286.wav	3.25	Some may end up in hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_287.wav	3.59	The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_288.wav	3.16	The alliance said it may not wait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_289.wav	3.20	I'm not putting myself down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_290.wav	2.73	That is highly unfair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_291.wav	3.97	There is great demand for human cloning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_292.wav	3.72	I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_293.wav	3.46	I am just trying to do my job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_294.wav	4.18	I don't think we could have expected better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_295.wav	2.18	You take a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_296.wav	3.33	What are you going to do exactly?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_297.wav	4.14	Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_298.wav	3.89	Mr Mason is claiming unfair dismissal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_299.wav	3.03	I just want to change my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_300.wav	4.01	A statement is expected in April.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_301.wav	2.26	Check that he is dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_302.wav	5.42	CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_303.wav	3.24	He is also a great finisher.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_304.wav	3.76	This club have been fair to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_305.wav	3.20	He knew it would cost him millions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_306.wav	3.16	This is too much like Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_307.wav	3.20	He's been here on numerous occasions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_308.wav	2.82	A counter reaction was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_309.wav	2.61	He said he was sorry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_310.wav	3.97	Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_311.wav	5.25	Clearly, she says, we would never resort to such devices.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_312.wav	3.84	That only came out during a radio interview.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_313.wav	3.12	The record companies have gone through the floor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_314.wav	2.99	We are waiting for them to calm down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_315.wav	3.07	We are now setting about finding them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_316.wav	4.40	In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_317.wav	3.46	Neither was involved in violence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_318.wav	4.27	It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_319.wav	3.76	Lucky for us, he enjoyed the experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_320.wav	2.86	I am not among its admirers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_321.wav	3.25	Hitches can be expected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_322.wav	3.33	He wasn't ready to cope with the pressures.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_323.wav	4.40	This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_324.wav	2.82	I'll tell you honestly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_325.wav	2.77	Dialogue is the key.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_326.wav	3.42	He will address the nation this evening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_327.wav	3.84	They have shown a great desire and attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_328.wav	3.54	I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_329.wav	3.88	Motherwell have no such good fortune.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_330.wav	3.93	But he is revelling in the big stage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_331.wav	3.20	You have to think not.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_332.wav	5.72	No, no, it's not what you think.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_333.wav	3.16	This is a national crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_334.wav	2.78	Scotland were beaten again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_335.wav	3.93	Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_336.wav	4.74	Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_337.wav	2.65	The whole thing would be perfect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_338.wav	3.67	What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_339.wav	4.69	There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_340.wav	4.78	However, we had no failures on our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_341.wav	2.78	She had been sexually assaulted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_342.wav	3.29	His job was not advertised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_343.wav	3.03	The event has now gone to Helsinki.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_344.wav	2.95	It is a thing of beauty to watch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_345.wav	3.29	With us, we just want them to respond.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_346.wav	3.24	And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_347.wav	2.44	They are the heroes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_348.wav	3.46	For me, it was a shattering experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_349.wav	3.24	Scottish life can be like this, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_350.wav	2.91	This seems like a very good idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_351.wav	3.63	It was not confirmed by Scotland Yard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_352.wav	3.89	Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_353.wav	2.95	It took more than two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_354.wav	3.37	There is access for disabled people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_355.wav	2.95	The home was now under new management.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_356.wav	3.91	We don't want to push him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_357.wav	2.86	I like what has happened!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_358.wav	3.72	It is like a theatre of the absurd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_359.wav	2.44	One was a lawyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_360.wav	2.44	There is no openness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_361.wav	3.59	We are still going ahead with our plans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_362.wav	3.97	It's being very carefully looked at.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_363.wav	2.95	It was a job he loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_364.wav	3.41	Now it has become a big picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_365.wav	3.67	It may encourage more people to prospect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_366.wav	3.03	But let's not get carried away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_367.wav	4.40	Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_368.wav	3.80	This is the last thing we ever expected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_369.wav	2.56	It looks like paradise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_370.wav	3.50	This means a great deal to the families.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_371.wav	4.61	Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_372.wav	2.48	We were short of athletes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_373.wav	3.20	They want to avoid a flashpoint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_374.wav	3.84	The European is a piece of vanity publishing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_375.wav	2.48	We want to keep the pound.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_376.wav	3.89	The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_377.wav	3.16	Only local people are helping.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_378.wav	3.80	They are so easy for youngsters to open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_379.wav	3.46	There were three boys and two girls.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_380.wav	5.21	Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_381.wav	2.35	He had no answer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_382.wav	2.48	There is a job to be done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_383.wav	3.16	Scotland is too small a country for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_384.wav	2.52	I am not obsessed with sex.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_385.wav	3.80	Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_386.wav	2.69	I can't believe what has happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_387.wav	3.24	It's about my time as a guitarist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_388.wav	2.91	You do that because you want to win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_389.wav	3.93	At this level, you have all to perform well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_390.wav	2.52	It was early morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_391.wav	2.73	Partition is not an option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_392.wav	3.59	We've been treated with complete contempt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_393.wav	2.56	There must be boundaries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_394.wav	3.33	I cannot confirm the name of any driver.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_395.wav	3.03	The home team had an amazing start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_396.wav	2.56	We can make changes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_397.wav	4.82	It is a comforting fantasy - but it remains a fantasy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_398.wav	2.56	The conclusion is enthralling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_399.wav	3.25	Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_400.wav	3.46	This is usually done by the space shuttle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_401.wav	2.93	The best option is to destroy the plants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_402.wav	3.93	Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_403.wav	3.54	Friends of the family have given their support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_404.wav	4.31	This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_405.wav	2.86	You name it, they have it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_406.wav	3.25	We are obviously disturbed by this case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_407.wav	3.20	The review has been conducted fairly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_408.wav	2.52	There is no smoking gun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_409.wav	4.31	We could play someone else, but he is ready to play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_410.wav	4.22	He feels he has cost us the game, but he didn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_411.wav	5.29	He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_412.wav	2.82	It is a natural reaction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_413.wav	3.29	Whether this return was too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_414.wav	2.78	I don't believe that money is the answer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_415.wav	2.43	Jackson may well be right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_416.wav	2.90	I am in a very difficult position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_417.wav	3.42	They will run in tandem with New Work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_418.wav	3.12	As for Owen, class is permanent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_419.wav	3.29	THE pain was almost too much to bear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_420.wav	2.99	My thoughts are with their families.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_421.wav	2.86	He is not very big, either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_422.wav	3.07	Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p314\p314_423.wav	3.25	How come it is so often unnoticed?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_001.wav	2.48	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_002.wav	5.68	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_003.wav	8.45	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_004.wav	6.36	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_005.wav	7.62	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_006.wav	7.04	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_007.wav	5.94	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_008.wav	9.62	These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_009.wav	7.08	There is , according to a legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_010.wav	5.13	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_011.wav	8.11	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_012.wav	5.81	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_013.wav	6.28	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_014.wav	5.59	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_015.wav	6.53	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_016.wav	7.04	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_017.wav	3.76	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_018.wav	8.11	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_019.wav	9.86	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but the refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_020.wav	4.40	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_021.wav	9.90	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increase.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_022.wav	7.96	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_023.wav	13.40	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_025.wav	3.72	We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_026.wav	3.76	Meetings will also remain private.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_027.wav	1.84	Have we tried everything?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_028.wav	3.03	It's not going to work out that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_029.wav	2.56	We have worked hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_030.wav	3.41	After that, it's a step into the unknown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_031.wav	3.67	Naturally, she said yes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_032.wav	3.84	This is not a war on terror.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_033.wav	3.54	It is not for any other purpose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_034.wav	3.59	There will always be problems on the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_035.wav	4.06	Why you did it will never be known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_036.wav	3.20	He was in his element.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_037.wav	4.23	She is believed to be in South Africa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_038.wav	3.03	What a week he has had.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_039.wav	3.33	We just want this season to end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_040.wav	4.70	He is looking for a sporting challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_041.wav	3.88	There is a new confidence about the club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_042.wav	4.14	I accept that, but is very upsetting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_043.wav	3.20	We accept the challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_044.wav	3.98	The question is, Will it be enough?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_045.wav	4.05	After that it is up to the boss.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_046.wav	5.12	They were taken to prove a point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_047.wav	3.20	It doesn't have to be in Inverness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_048.wav	3.29	And they removed a Borderer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_049.wav	3.37	So, why does he do it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_050.wav	3.63	I would love to have him home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_051.wav	3.63	It is very unfair, and something should be done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_052.wav	3.12	He had no enemies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_053.wav	3.12	That is not the case this time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_054.wav	6.11	We are going to New Broomfield to win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_055.wav	4.65	But the law is very clear on this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_056.wav	3.54	They treated me with respect and courtesy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_057.wav	3.50	There was only silence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_058.wav	4.40	However, he said it would be likely to bring a chill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_059.wav	3.33	It doesn't look as pretty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_060.wav	3.80	However, our players will fight for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_061.wav	3.63	Everyone was very saddened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_062.wav	3.46	He declined to give further details.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_063.wav	2.65	He said it was for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_064.wav	3.16	This is a dream come true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_065.wav	3.50	The problem is not confined to the UK.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_066.wav	3.50	I wouldn't give them a grade.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_067.wav	2.91	What on earth is wrong with you?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_068.wav	2.48	This is far too high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_069.wav	4.44	We are still going ahead with our plans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_070.wav	3.97	IS Tony Blair on drugs?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_071.wav	3.50	And if he hadn't become a musician?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_072.wav	3.71	It has certainly paid off for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_073.wav	3.71	He was also a great man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_074.wav	5.21	We have a major concern about the enforcement action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_075.wav	3.71	It is clear that change is required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_076.wav	5.08	Thirty schools were closed in the Western Isles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_077.wav	2.48	This is a big step up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_078.wav	3.38	Robin Williams is subdued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_079.wav	4.52	The judge was very nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_080.wav	4.82	They control the prices paid to farmers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_081.wav	4.61	The company yesterday refused to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_082.wav	3.55	Most of them have already gone home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_083.wav	4.74	Worse still, he might be singing Lady in Red.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_084.wav	2.78	Weaknesses there are, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_085.wav	3.29	It is, after all, a very funny play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_086.wav	2.99	Can you imagine a world without design?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_087.wav	3.03	He was caught and fired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_088.wav	3.50	I feel confident about the outcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_089.wav	2.86	The driver escaped injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_090.wav	3.89	Mini rugby is a great thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_091.wav	2.86	There was no bad behaviour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_092.wav	3.89	Today she has been released.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_093.wav	3.33	It's a much bigger problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_094.wav	3.46	There are no problems between us at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_095.wav	5.47	Hopefully, he will be back in contention next week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_096.wav	2.18	I've had it for the exams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_097.wav	2.99	I hope it comes out all right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_098.wav	3.16	I will just have to be patient.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_099.wav	3.84	It's a sensible management decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_100.wav	2.52	I kept it very simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_101.wav	2.86	The rest was badminton.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_102.wav	2.90	It will take several days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_103.wav	3.03	We had to push to get a goal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_104.wav	2.56	That got me out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_105.wav	4.10	I would just like someone to confess.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_106.wav	4.69	We are making progress on waiting lists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_107.wav	3.89	It will have to ratify the deal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_108.wav	7.64	I did not have faith in the procedures.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_109.wav	3.76	I was not a joiner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_110.wav	3.88	It has to find out what went wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_111.wav	2.31	Until you hit the big games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_112.wav	2.99	It has until Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_113.wav	3.33	I've tried to get on with my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_114.wav	3.12	She has the biggest part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_115.wav	2.61	We will win this tie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_116.wav	2.69	This is totally untrue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_117.wav	4.05	Or someone wants to say something different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_118.wav	2.44	I think they have to change that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_119.wav	3.03	This series is for real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_120.wav	2.56	It's great news, isn't it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_121.wav	2.05	It's very ingenious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_122.wav	5.59	That would depend on the parole board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_123.wav	4.48	It is all up to the Members.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_124.wav	4.57	The two sets are different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_125.wav	3.29	And now the pressure is off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_126.wav	3.61	You can see the appeal of running away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_127.wav	3.71	Their opening was disastrous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_128.wav	3.80	The time is up for Iraq to comply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_129.wav	4.14	There can be no compromise on that demand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_130.wav	3.84	The following are the principal provisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_131.wav	3.12	Too much has already been said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_132.wav	3.80	Now, however, things are different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_133.wav	3.41	It was not a beautiful game, was it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_134.wav	3.20	She is not the world champion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_135.wav	2.46	It would be difficult to argue with that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_136.wav	4.57	While they went on a holiday, we got the contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_137.wav	2.82	He is a bully.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_138.wav	4.40	The case was taken on by his brother.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_139.wav	2.52	I've won the British.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_140.wav	3.33	And so the cycle continues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_141.wav	3.29	I don't have many friends.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_142.wav	4.27	However, it was a different story in the final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_143.wav	2.95	They exist in name alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_144.wav	2.52	I am not retiring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_145.wav	3.67	All will be revealed in due course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_146.wav	4.70	In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_147.wav	3.16	And frankly, it's been a while.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_148.wav	3.20	Feel for five seconds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_149.wav	4.10	I hope it is a good omen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_150.wav	4.70	Because if it matters to them, it matters to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_151.wav	3.42	They will appear again next week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_152.wav	3.46	Failure is not an option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_153.wav	3.93	We were not consulted regarding this appointment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_154.wav	3.38	You look at that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_155.wav	4.01	Things begin to spring to life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_156.wav	3.80	Or was it Some kind of a ham?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_157.wav	2.22	I understood that concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_158.wav	4.05	The things writers and directors say!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_159.wav	3.50	I am prepared to step down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_160.wav	3.63	It was like a dream to be here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_161.wav	5.21	The four characters could be one somebody suggested.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_162.wav	3.20	Either way, it doesn't bother me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_163.wav	2.95	It would help to heal the wounds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_164.wav	3.84	We did not deserve to go through.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_165.wav	2.47	It's got to be in the head.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_166.wav	2.52	It certainly sounded it at times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_167.wav	3.63	It will be too hot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_168.wav	3.37	That happens in boxing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_169.wav	2.95	Consumers will also benefit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_170.wav	2.45	None of the opinions is good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_171.wav	4.61	We were hopeful that it would be successful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_172.wav	3.46	They must not succeed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_173.wav	2.69	He declined to provide a breakdown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_174.wav	3.33	But the foundations have been laid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_175.wav	3.24	I have never seen him like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_176.wav	3.59	And you need to be so resourceful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_177.wav	4.62	Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarerry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_178.wav	3.80	She hopes to study in Britain one day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_179.wav	4.52	Everything in the world was focused on London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_180.wav	3.58	We played better after the break.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_181.wav	2.99	But this relative success has not been easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_182.wav	3.12	It was the same with the Dickens.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_183.wav	3.62	Of course it is still possible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_184.wav	4.69	Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_185.wav	4.19	That, in a way, is the point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_186.wav	3.80	What is so unusual about this case?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_187.wav	5.12	It is not about the money, it is about everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_188.wav	3.03	That would end it for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_189.wav	5.94	Police are treating the incident as attempted murder.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_190.wav	4.23	Sure, he is the best player in the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_191.wav	4.27	I just love lessons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_192.wav	4.31	Retirement is on his mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_193.wav	3.59	It's to do with this place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_194.wav	6.23	The home side didn't stand a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_195.wav	3.55	We shall not be moved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_196.wav	3.67	The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_197.wav	2.60	It is not just the agencies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_198.wav	3.55	There must be boundaries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_199.wav	3.88	However, he was later released without charge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_200.wav	3.42	Arsenal refused to be evicted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_201.wav	2.35	I watch the other visitors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_202.wav	3.07	Nobody is pushing out to the right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_204.wav	3.33	He confirmed his fitness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_205.wav	2.24	The gap is narrowing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_206.wav	3.97	All of us in Scotland should be viligant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_207.wav	3.20	Both men were uninjured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_208.wav	3.37	My husband was fighting for his life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_209.wav	4.10	It is not a financial issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_210.wav	3.12	We are in this for the long haul.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_211.wav	3.46	We have a budget in March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_212.wav	3.41	There was no respite.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_213.wav	3.50	I got very, very tired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_214.wav	3.63	I am really sorry that he is going.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_215.wav	4.18	They will do their own thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_216.wav	2.86	It is too much for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_217.wav	5.04	But is this enough to provoke a killing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_218.wav	4.14	I didn't just walk in and get it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_219.wav	3.46	We've made a couple of albums.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_220.wav	3.59	We need a much wider debate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_221.wav	4.18	My attitude is exactly the same as before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_222.wav	2.18	Look at a computer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_223.wav	3.59	They went back to the seventeenth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_224.wav	2.99	First, the programme was unbalanced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_225.wav	4.61	So what could be better than becoming a captain?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_226.wav	4.01	However, it proved to be the turning point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_227.wav	5.12	However, everyone should do it once in their life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_228.wav	5.33	In hindsight, it was the wrong decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_229.wav	3.54	I waited and waited.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_230.wav	4.01	We all knew it could not be true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_231.wav	3.84	Its future is uncertain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_232.wav	5.89	I'm very surprised and obviously delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_233.wav	3.37	It doesn't look good for her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_234.wav	3.59	She said he did not look too happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_235.wav	4.27	We are aware of the problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_236.wav	3.67	Where will the elderly go then?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_237.wav	4.18	Then it was changed without notice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_238.wav	3.20	He had a great game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_239.wav	3.80	The following year, they asked him again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_240.wav	4.06	It is the men who create the demand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_241.wav	4.74	I'm very happy indeed to be almost redundant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_242.wav	3.29	Every case is completely different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_243.wav	3.11	It's a scandal, a disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_244.wav	4.01	Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_245.wav	3.97	However, he said the money had not been wasted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_246.wav	2.22	It will be fine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_247.wav	3.29	He should emerge as the winner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_248.wav	4.14	They are you, the fans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_249.wav	2.69	We're just waiting for her reaction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_250.wav	4.23	At the end of the day, two men have been shot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_251.wav	3.11	What a difference a game can make.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_252.wav	4.61	They will not be able to come back, in my opinion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_253.wav	2.22	Why do it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_254.wav	2.82	It opened last month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_255.wav	4.44	This will be our new beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_256.wav	5.76	If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_257.wav	3.97	I have totally had enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_258.wav	3.50	Hopefully today will be the turning point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_259.wav	3.93	We shall be ready for Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_260.wav	4.87	It was bound to happen, and it has happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_261.wav	5.21	There were no reported casualties on the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_262.wav	2.39	What are you waiting for?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_263.wav	4.82	In the meantime, everyone is taking everyone to court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_264.wav	4.01	This is still happening in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_265.wav	4.01	Another issue will be policing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_266.wav	2.77	Today was first class.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_267.wav	3.42	This is the biggest surprise of my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_268.wav	4.87	On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_269.wav	3.80	This is a good move for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_270.wav	2.99	Feel the heat?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_271.wav	3.84	She was so full of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_272.wav	5.55	I should have given him one in return.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_273.wav	3.25	I began to pray.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_274.wav	4.91	The princess has strong links with Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_275.wav	3.37	I am very confident about tomorrow night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_276.wav	2.57	I just wanted to fly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_277.wav	3.03	And he has a tale to tell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_278.wav	3.84	Footballers have also been targeted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_279.wav	3.46	The deadline is real and absolute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_280.wav	3.59	So, how did this happen?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_281.wav	4.36	It's all a part of letting it go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_282.wav	4.66	I just hope it's not tonight against us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_283.wav	3.42	There are no quick fixes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_284.wav	3.20	The change was not instant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_285.wav	3.12	We've got the bronze.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_286.wav	3.07	They use them for everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_287.wav	3.97	Who is to benefit from this change?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_288.wav	3.54	We are not defeated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_289.wav	3.50	He knows what he's got to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_290.wav	2.99	Clearly, the stakes are high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_291.wav	3.25	We have been going for three years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_292.wav	2.86	We deserved the three points.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_293.wav	4.44	It is planned for London in the spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_294.wav	4.65	War and force are not the only solutions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_295.wav	4.57	They would have to go to the Royal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_296.wav	4.18	It didn't matter who was in their way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_297.wav	3.03	Which brings us to the point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_298.wav	2.95	I think it's difficult for Bonnie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_299.wav	3.72	I am quite excited about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_300.wav	3.16	Everyone agrees with that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_301.wav	2.99	She had denied the charge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_302.wav	5.21	If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_303.wav	3.46	Sometimes you stand on them as they collapse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_304.wav	2.65	I didn't feel good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_305.wav	3.12	It is believed that he had been stabbed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_306.wav	4.44	It is an expensive part of their equipment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_307.wav	2.99	Let's get to know him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_308.wav	2.03	We have got to attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_309.wav	3.18	Well, they were the unlucky ones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_310.wav	3.99	Time has run out for Saddam Hussein.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_311.wav	4.48	It divided audiences at Cannes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_312.wav	3.76	It's a lovely, lovely film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_313.wav	2.82	How would it work?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_314.wav	3.33	We told them in July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_315.wav	2.48	The film was great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_316.wav	4.27	Venus rejects the very suggestion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_317.wav	2.69	It's a real challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_318.wav	3.54	The police believe that the man was not injured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_319.wav	4.10	Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_320.wav	3.80	There was too much at stake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_321.wav	2.91	I read about it in the newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_322.wav	4.27	What did they think of her voice?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_323.wav	4.53	Is that not uncanny?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_324.wav	4.05	It has to reinvent itself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_325.wav	3.80	It is a good result for Great Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_326.wav	3.29	He was happy with his form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_327.wav	4.74	His art was not just about emotions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_328.wav	4.36	Nato was not a love affair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_329.wav	3.33	It's a production company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_330.wav	3.37	But we will not be scared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_331.wav	5.55	But that is not an issue for now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_332.wav	4.36	It will not work in our favour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_333.wav	3.89	It is the wealthiest in Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_334.wav	3.37	He is on the wrong side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_335.wav	4.36	That was a disgraceful performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_336.wav	4.27	There will be no receivers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_337.wav	4.31	My son was too young to die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_338.wav	3.89	The air campaign is not over yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_339.wav	3.93	It's a national sport.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_340.wav	3.03	But this isn't a play about The Troubles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_341.wav	4.40	The picture in Glasgow was improving, he added.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_342.wav	3.80	Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_343.wav	3.97	I was shocked and outraged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_344.wav	3.63	Not many people like to do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_345.wav	2.69	It was extremely cold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_346.wav	3.42	Italy would be lukewarm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_347.wav	3.63	People are using it in their daily lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_348.wav	4.74	Chelsea was a great club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_349.wav	3.03	We have to open up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_350.wav	4.90	She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_351.wav	3.06	There is a review outgoing at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_352.wav	4.70	The pensioners did not want to know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_353.wav	3.80	It was just awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_354.wav	3.37	We are doing okay in the league.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_355.wav	4.61	Today the Kremlin would be contacted in seconds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_356.wav	3.72	It is time for concerted national action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_357.wav	3.46	Do you know who we are?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_358.wav	2.99	Souter will be back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_359.wav	3.29	I'd like to report a murder.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_360.wav	3.55	I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_361.wav	2.52	It certainly gives you hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_362.wav	3.93	If he does not leave, he will be shot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_363.wav	2.65	Two people have died.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_364.wav	3.80	Fishermen are still in a state of confusion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_365.wav	4.02	I am delighted to have her back home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_366.wav	4.65	Many of them were his friends and colleagues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_367.wav	4.27	It is based on his movement records.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_368.wav	3.25	It wasn't an easy decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_369.wav	3.20	It left me with sadness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_370.wav	4.14	There is a changing of the guard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_371.wav	3.84	The boys are very confident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_372.wav	2.23	It was our time maybe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_373.wav	3.42	I know we can play a lot better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_374.wav	5.55	We said it will happen one night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_375.wav	2.90	It is a flexible concept.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_376.wav	4.06	This election is far from over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_377.wav	3.59	So the Government will be damaged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_378.wav	5.29	Ali was shot at, but refused to back down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_379.wav	3.33	However, we let them back into the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_380.wav	3.13	I have great confidence in Annabelle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_381.wav	3.50	Is that such a bad thing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_382.wav	4.91	You do need a check and a balance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_383.wav	3.76	Thousands of people were missing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_384.wav	4.65	Maloney is an engaging talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_385.wav	3.16	It's time to move on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_386.wav	3.42	I couldn't get out of bed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_387.wav	5.12	Mr Campbell received a phone call.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_388.wav	6.45	I'm delighted, and the players were brilliant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_389.wav	3.63	I can't describe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_390.wav	2.39	It changed my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_391.wav	3.97	But what will we put on it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_392.wav	3.67	It will benefit a lot of people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_393.wav	3.93	A new school will be built.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_394.wav	5.17	There may be hope this year, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_395.wav	3.80	That is not too bad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_396.wav	4.83	They are taking a stand against this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_397.wav	3.20	They are not left wing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_398.wav	3.03	I was the sheep.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_399.wav	4.31	I think we believed the tie was won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_400.wav	2.65	Well, there you go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_401.wav	3.37	How do you find the youngsters?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_402.wav	3.38	It was a great team effort.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_403.wav	4.31	In my experience, he does not do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_404.wav	3.84	Mr Forrester reacted angrily.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_405.wav	4.05	I am glad that justice has been done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_406.wav	3.89	Its first awards will just do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_407.wav	5.85	The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_408.wav	3.29	That is my preference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_409.wav	4.14	Taxation should be simplified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_410.wav	5.89	We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_411.wav	4.23	It is not that sort of inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_412.wav	3.08	I have signed a contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_413.wav	3.84	I have never been overly ambitious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_414.wav	3.42	We were beaten by the better team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_415.wav	3.16	I hope you don't regret it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_416.wav	3.03	He was all blackened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_417.wav	2.73	This is your country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_418.wav	3.97	This is the greatest moment of our lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_419.wav	3.97	Audiences there were shocked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_420.wav	3.55	They responded in the most positive way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_421.wav	4.06	The British government said she was coming home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_422.wav	2.52	We won very easily.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p316\p316_423.wav	3.48	That is a matter for Mr Graham.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_001.wav	2.39	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_002.wav	3.29	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_003.wav	7.77	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_004.wav	5.33	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_005.wav	6.15	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_006.wav	6.96	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_007.wav	5.42	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_008.wav	8.71	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_009.wav	6.23	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_010.wav	3.76	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_011.wav	7.56	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_012.wav	4.91	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_013.wav	4.91	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_014.wav	5.08	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_015.wav	6.49	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_016.wav	6.83	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_017.wav	4.10	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_018.wav	5.80	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_019.wav	8.41	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_020.wav	4.87	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_021.wav	9.86	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_022.wav	7.34	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_023.wav	11.44	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_024.wav	7.26	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_025.wav	2.82	They have the cash to do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_026.wav	2.78	There was a fine line to tread.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_027.wav	3.37	Yet it is all for two good causes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_028.wav	2.78	It is so elusive and light.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_029.wav	2.86	I am not a fan of stoppages.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_030.wav	3.46	The council has been open and transparent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_031.wav	2.39	Is the war over?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_032.wav	3.38	The country is in a state of chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_033.wav	2.82	But don't expect an easy ride.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_034.wav	4.10	In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_035.wav	3.67	Some US embassy staff have left the country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_036.wav	2.78	It was a policy they were against.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_037.wav	3.07	Her mother said she fell off a swing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_038.wav	3.16	We see little sign of improvement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_039.wav	4.82	The study, carried out by the consumer magazine Which?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_040.wav	2.86	The gaffer was great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_041.wav	4.22	Overall, however, these were also down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_042.wav	5.25	Ten years on, that advice is beginning to pay dividends.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_043.wav	2.91	Had she enjoyed the experience?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_044.wav	3.67	I feel very sad and extremely cut up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_045.wav	3.59	She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_046.wav	3.16	I would think they are just behind them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_047.wav	2.99	We then went to see the headmaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_048.wav	5.04	As far as we are concerned, he is innocent anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_049.wav	3.54	There is no mandate for a regime change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_050.wav	3.29	He did the right thing by ignoring me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_051.wav	3.46	These men are a part of India.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_052.wav	2.52	Are we going to stay up?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_053.wav	3.84	Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_054.wav	3.16	I am going home to see my children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_055.wav	3.41	New potential dangers were emerging.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_056.wav	2.86	That tells you something about them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_057.wav	4.31	The father was treated like a criminal, and why?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_058.wav	2.74	I am a drug addict.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_059.wav	2.99	I've had to take time off work today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_060.wav	4.14	The problem is the book.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_061.wav	3.24	There was no basis for their arrest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_062.wav	2.90	This wasn't just a big crowd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_063.wav	3.84	I wondered about changing back to rugby.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_064.wav	3.29	They say he wants to go to England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_065.wav	3.42	They are the partner of choice for anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_066.wav	4.27	Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_067.wav	2.86	Wagner was never like this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_068.wav	3.29	It is an attitude of mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_069.wav	3.59	How do you resurrect a dying town?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_070.wav	4.06	And what does it cost, and who is paying?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_071.wav	3.03	I've come here for the jersey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_072.wav	2.73	This is not an optional extra.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_073.wav	2.90	This is not the most crucial issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_074.wav	3.71	We don't know much, but we are still awaiting news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_075.wav	2.48	It's that sort of night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_076.wav	4.19	Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_077.wav	3.20	Will we ever play together again?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_078.wav	3.29	It's been a terrible ordeal for Margaret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_079.wav	3.93	I played well but missed a few chances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_080.wav	3.46	That must be left to the Parole Board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_081.wav	2.99	I'm so proud of my team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_082.wav	3.54	They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_083.wav	2.99	That would open the gates of hell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_084.wav	3.89	This has not, and has been neglected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_085.wav	3.12	McNaughton was not so sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_086.wav	2.99	What did you learn in school today?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_087.wav	4.48	If you're a national company, you must provide it all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_088.wav	3.63	We will see how he is after treatment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_089.wav	3.76	This is rapidly becoming a fiasco.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_090.wav	3.33	There is no signature on this document.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_091.wav	3.12	We could not compete with Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_092.wav	4.74	In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_093.wav	3.75	But they must serve their sentence in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_094.wav	3.80	He was critically ill in hospital last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_095.wav	3.12	However, it is much bigger than that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_096.wav	3.12	One season, they might do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_097.wav	2.77	Our approach will be different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_098.wav	3.16	Too much has already been said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_099.wav	3.93	He asked me in a tolerance zone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_100.wav	2.73	But don't worry just yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_101.wav	4.10	This championship is different from the other majors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_102.wav	4.14	For now, though, my future is with Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_103.wav	2.99	I drove the ball well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_104.wav	4.27	If so, how does it intend to achieve this result?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_105.wav	3.93	His handling raises a wider issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_106.wav	2.86	We have got the school holidays on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_107.wav	3.24	This is not a recipe for conflict.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_108.wav	5.04	They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_109.wav	3.25	We understand the changes in the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_110.wav	2.69	It is a potential factor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_111.wav	2.35	This is the big one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_112.wav	2.65	That just wasn't good enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_113.wav	3.59	The company has other problems with the shells.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_114.wav	3.97	The working families tax credit is far better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_115.wav	2.99	He had done his homework properly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_116.wav	4.61	Then, as we know too well, anything can happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_117.wav	3.07	We must get the three points.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_118.wav	3.84	Players were held in equally low regard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_119.wav	3.46	I was in the train station overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_120.wav	3.03	It's to do with context.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_121.wav	2.94	Now we need to keep our heads up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_122.wav	2.69	Our home is your home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_123.wav	2.95	It is essential that we win the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_124.wav	3.29	There was no confusion over the second.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_125.wav	5.04	Alan Milburn, the health secretary, refused to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_126.wav	3.59	A decision is expected shortly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_127.wav	3.38	Hear what they have to say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_128.wav	5.59	I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_129.wav	2.39	You would be wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_130.wav	3.93	Motorists will buy passes in advance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_131.wav	4.44	Mr Wilson had two brothers and three sisters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_132.wav	2.99	I think it is wide open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_133.wav	3.25	They too refused to come out and talk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_134.wav	2.82	We took the chances when they came.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_135.wav	3.72	It is important that vital services are maintained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_136.wav	3.25	These services may also have to be cut.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_137.wav	3.54	Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_138.wav	3.67	The captaincy will help that, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_139.wav	2.95	We can't have it both ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_140.wav	3.25	Actors stand still in the frame.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_141.wav	3.59	Who honestly expected anything else?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_142.wav	4.53	We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_143.wav	3.80	MOVIE stars are public property.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_144.wav	3.50	They never looked like winning it either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_145.wav	3.63	A Foreign Office spokesman declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_146.wav	4.18	No details of the talks were given.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_147.wav	4.82	The group is separate from the Real IRA.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_148.wav	3.29	It was a wilful act of violence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_149.wav	3.93	On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_150.wav	3.03	We never got off the bus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_151.wav	2.86	The driver escaped injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_152.wav	3.37	T, Is there anything in the wound?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_153.wav	3.08	They should be looking at his victims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_154.wav	2.31	We told them in June.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_155.wav	3.50	It's all about money, money, money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_156.wav	2.78	I won't make an official complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_157.wav	4.95	Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_158.wav	3.89	The research is published in the journal, Nature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_159.wav	2.39	She is a double victim.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_160.wav	2.39	How can you not react?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_161.wav	3.50	They make a selective perception process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_162.wav	3.46	There can be no compromise on that demand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_163.wav	3.20	I am totally devoted to this job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_164.wav	3.08	The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_165.wav	2.69	There was an e-mail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_166.wav	2.69	That is a lot of writing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_167.wav	3.25	I try to be open to experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_168.wav	3.89	Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_169.wav	5.21	We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_170.wav	2.78	It is no place for a poet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_171.wav	2.95	This is excellent value for money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_172.wav	2.61	Each day is a new beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_173.wav	2.78	My daughter is an adult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_174.wav	4.10	It obviously changes the prospects for getting agreement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_175.wav	3.29	They are difficult awards to decide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_176.wav	3.12	Thereafter he left Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_177.wav	3.12	We've come from a long way back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_178.wav	2.77	A lot of things can go wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_179.wav	2.78	I was delighted with Robbie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_180.wav	3.03	He seemed to lose his focus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_181.wav	2.35	I'll just do my best.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_182.wav	2.78	Three penalties were given.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_183.wav	2.90	And the World Cup has not even begun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_184.wav	2.31	The police were called in.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_185.wav	3.07	The group would never be the same again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_186.wav	3.25	Aye, but who do you really support?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_187.wav	3.20	She was eight months pregnant at the time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_188.wav	2.56	This is not a birthday party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_189.wav	2.39	This makes no sense!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_190.wav	2.48	It's a drop in the bucket.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_191.wav	3.33	I've had a hard time, to be honest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_192.wav	3.84	He said that this is beautiful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_193.wav	3.93	During the communist time they were very privileged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_194.wav	3.20	That option cannot be ruled out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_195.wav	3.71	Women were mostly notable by their absence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_196.wav	4.14	Everyone needs a holiday, even the Salvation Army.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_197.wav	4.36	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_198.wav	3.25	Three years probation is just a joke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_199.wav	3.50	That's how she wants to remember him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_200.wav	3.54	How do you respond to losing your child?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_201.wav	2.39	Who is the employer?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_202.wav	3.46	This is the biggest thing in the world, isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_203.wav	3.84	Mr Smith was dismissive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_204.wav	3.59	McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_205.wav	3.16	Pressure of work is no excuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_206.wav	4.23	On this form, they have a real chance of going up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_207.wav	3.67	Two charges of threatening crew members were dropped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_208.wav	2.82	Would he be able to live with that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_209.wav	3.20	However, what is his calibre?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_210.wav	4.14	I COULD hardly keep up with Professor McKean.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_211.wav	4.61	Our plans for Dunfermline have not changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_212.wav	2.60	It's a production company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_213.wav	4.44	No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_214.wav	3.50	She died in middle age.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_215.wav	4.52	They do the work, you know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_216.wav	3.80	There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_217.wav	2.56	We are in the hat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_218.wav	2.73	We were a load of rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_219.wav	3.07	Thus far we have received no complaints.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_220.wav	2.91	I haven't made the donation yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_221.wav	3.25	Other people also tried.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_222.wav	3.03	But Harry has become a franchise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_223.wav	2.65	He is at war with his knee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_224.wav	4.18	I could go on, but none of these things is true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_225.wav	2.52	I can't deny that fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_226.wav	2.99	Clubs can only do so much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_227.wav	2.90	It's unsafe for society.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_228.wav	4.36	Seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_229.wav	3.50	It would have very little impact on them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_230.wav	4.44	It would still have been a good film, but very different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_231.wav	5.04	But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_232.wav	3.58	I will be having talks with the workforce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_233.wav	2.82	I don't care to recall it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_234.wav	2.31	That's the whole idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_235.wav	2.61	They showed a lot of heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_236.wav	2.65	Michael, he is running!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_237.wav	2.82	My life is a mess.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_238.wav	2.52	He did not report it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_239.wav	2.99	You must be ready to play anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_240.wav	3.25	For example they could be in school uniform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_241.wav	2.99	Surely the panel was interested?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_242.wav	3.76	They were even being used by primary pupils.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_243.wav	3.08	It's like English in its underwear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_244.wav	4.05	This event allows us to emphasise the positive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_245.wav	3.54	I now know that from memory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_246.wav	2.35	We need to tighten up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_247.wav	2.22	I saw it at a ruck.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_248.wav	2.22	This is a huge event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_249.wav	2.30	Just get on with your job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_250.wav	4.66	Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_251.wav	3.89	That decision was applauded by Williamson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_252.wav	2.69	You are not going in blind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_253.wav	2.90	They just made me feel dizzy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_254.wav	3.89	He must have sat down, relieved it was over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_255.wav	3.54	He will do so today in Monte Carlo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_256.wav	3.24	The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_257.wav	3.37	Health care workers and labourers followed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_258.wav	4.19	Blair also faces pressure from within the cabinet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_259.wav	3.07	We have great confidence in Derek.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_260.wav	3.84	It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_261.wav	2.60	We are not too surprised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_262.wav	4.06	There were no new cases yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_263.wav	3.50	If only the problems concerned the players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_264.wav	2.69	It will be an eye for an eye.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_265.wav	3.20	Whatever happened to that one?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_266.wav	3.54	There were no proposals on the table.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_267.wav	3.03	I have spoken to head office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_268.wav	3.97	Here the National Gallery has been very clever.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_269.wav	2.69	Do you want a cup of tea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_270.wav	4.61	Three further cases were confirmed yesterday in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_271.wav	3.29	We have all been shocked by her death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_272.wav	3.12	We are asking the council to think again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_273.wav	3.33	We are committed to urgent action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_274.wav	3.03	Hopefully, now we're getting it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_275.wav	2.52	I am totally surprised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_276.wav	3.37	Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_277.wav	4.01	But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_278.wav	3.20	The bookies have got it about right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_279.wav	3.84	There's not much money in cycling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_280.wav	3.24	It was always open for extension.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_281.wav	2.73	I think we're very different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_282.wav	4.61	For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_283.wav	4.44	The way forward is working with other disciplines.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_284.wav	2.90	And that is not a bad idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_285.wav	3.03	He also has a house in Italy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_286.wav	3.12	Blood samples were taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_287.wav	4.87	In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_288.wav	3.38	Scotland need to work on two key areas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_289.wav	2.69	It's so creative and different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_290.wav	3.29	They are in care for a reason.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_291.wav	3.76	They refused to fire on their own countrymen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_292.wav	3.97	In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_293.wav	3.80	Obviously, Airbus is one of these.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_294.wav	2.31	It got no better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_295.wav	2.69	I keep my fingers crossed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_296.wav	3.20	Some were close to tears.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_297.wav	3.03	It would then be up to the judge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_298.wav	3.63	Was all this really just five months ago?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_299.wav	3.08	Some reports said they had been killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_300.wav	2.95	This is the start of a new campaign.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_301.wav	3.71	It is scheduled to go ahead next Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_302.wav	2.86	The failings are serious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_303.wav	2.74	It is like a bereavement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_304.wav	3.29	I shouldn't have to put up with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_305.wav	3.03	It could have been just a quick fix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_306.wav	2.91	I got on very well with Allan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_307.wav	3.20	That has given me great confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_308.wav	2.90	This is a dream come true for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_309.wav	3.33	No other country has ever won this tournament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_310.wav	3.59	However, there could be more bad weather to come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_311.wav	3.20	He was lying face down in the water.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_312.wav	3.07	He confirmed there had been no warning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_313.wav	2.69	Ferguson did not hesitate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_314.wav	4.14	Managers and clinicians must work together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_315.wav	2.48	They didn't have a care in the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_316.wav	2.69	I was in the zone in the morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_317.wav	2.48	He urged people to forgive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_318.wav	3.46	In fact, it might just be beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_319.wav	2.60	So he is open to ideas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_320.wav	3.20	Central to their cause was Barry Nicholson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_321.wav	4.27	Not that anyone has actually suffered, for her art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_322.wav	2.78	There is no right to appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_323.wav	3.12	We are expected to do better than before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_324.wav	4.10	The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_325.wav	3.03	I am not even thinking about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_326.wav	4.23	Scotland is one of the favourites, with Glasgow to the fore.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_327.wav	3.16	The World Trade Centre was our Main Street.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_328.wav	2.31	It is good for their eyesight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_329.wav	2.52	I feel it is very irrational.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_330.wav	4.99	It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workmanlike.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_331.wav	3.33	It is still with Ministers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_332.wav	2.95	The effect was almost magical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_333.wav	3.97	Everything is obviously in the very early stages.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_334.wav	3.07	We are not doing the Today programme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_335.wav	3.88	It's not that difficult, it really isn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_336.wav	3.63	She was charged with perjury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_337.wav	2.65	I was not a joiner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_338.wav	2.99	The sleeper was six hours late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_339.wav	4.01	Tax is a matter for national governments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_340.wav	3.46	Stewart will travel with some confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_341.wav	3.12	Sunday's game was not a trial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_342.wav	3.72	They were average apart, together superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_343.wav	2.86	Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_344.wav	4.31	This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_345.wav	4.52	That never seemed likely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_346.wav	4.83	A decision is expected next March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_347.wav	2.78	We don't believe anything anymore.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_348.wav	2.90	I am awaiting a reply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_349.wav	3.67	There was no need for such a hostel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_350.wav	3.59	This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_351.wav	4.91	Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_352.wav	2.26	There's no doubt about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_353.wav	3.03	It just came into my head that day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_354.wav	3.38	We've always had a very positive attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_355.wav	2.44	What's a boy to do?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_356.wav	2.90	We're not an employment agency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_357.wav	2.39	The other was the tabloids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_358.wav	2.61	They should be swept away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_359.wav	3.20	They thought the set-up there was unfair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_360.wav	3.16	I am saddened to hear of the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_361.wav	2.99	We want to replicate that success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_362.wav	2.73	We were lucky to have survived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_363.wav	3.67	Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_364.wav	2.48	I am very happy to be here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_365.wav	2.73	He would help me with the form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_366.wav	2.56	We could easily be cut again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_367.wav	2.99	That meant the search was unlawful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_368.wav	1.96	And he goes with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_369.wav	2.52	The actors just have to say so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_370.wav	3.46	Someone else can do the cooking that night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_371.wav	2.77	I am so lucky for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_372.wav	2.31	It broke up my marriage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_373.wav	4.53	He planned to relocate to Scotland, probably Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_374.wav	3.20	The minister is the engineer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_375.wav	3.37	After that, it's a step into the unknown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_376.wav	3.16	I think it was briefly considered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_377.wav	2.95	And Rangers think they have problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_378.wav	3.38	We talk to each other about these matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_379.wav	2.52	It's a hidden problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_380.wav	3.29	They serve a multitude of purposes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_381.wav	3.71	There will be two other areas of contention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_382.wav	2.31	I lost a part of me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_383.wav	4.82	Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_384.wav	5.38	Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_385.wav	3.20	But he has strong links to Labour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_386.wav	2.69	Bob Dylan is getting old.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_387.wav	2.90	I never thought it would take this long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_388.wav	2.78	And he is immensely loyal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_389.wav	3.12	It will only work with changes in lifestyle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_390.wav	3.03	They think that it matters but it doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_391.wav	4.48	This looks like it is anything but open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_392.wav	3.07	My only ambition is to enjoy my work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_393.wav	2.35	She kept him on a string.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_394.wav	3.08	The committees are due to report next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_395.wav	2.39	It's a long-term solution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_396.wav	3.84	That doesn't mean the Cabinet has to endorse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_397.wav	2.13	What's the theme?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_398.wav	3.25	He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_399.wav	3.12	It shows that painting is still relevant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_400.wav	2.44	It's a very special unit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_401.wav	4.35	The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_402.wav	3.55	Davis is very supportive, as a director.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_403.wav	3.20	However, the groups denied the claims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_404.wav	3.33	It's only tackling congestion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_405.wav	3.25	And our game is about going forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_406.wav	3.12	They will have to cut through the roof.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_407.wav	3.03	Then there's one where people play for fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_408.wav	2.61	That's the law of the land.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_409.wav	3.16	They have enough intrusion at the time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_410.wav	2.44	What's wrong with that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_411.wav	3.29	This wasn't something we wanted to rush into.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_412.wav	3.93	Then one night only three people turn up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_413.wav	3.50	The parents will have a great time, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_414.wav	3.80	Now we see the impact of global politics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_415.wav	3.38	The figures are bad, but not that bad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_416.wav	2.65	This was not the show for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_417.wav	2.69	The police have to act to help them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_418.wav	2.69	She was extremely rigid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_419.wav	2.99	Neither side can win this war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_420.wav	3.76	Borrowing power was one of those improvements.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_421.wav	3.24	We do not, at the moment, have a shortage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_422.wav	2.86	Appointments should be made on merit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_423.wav	3.46	Manchester United are the classic example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p317\p317_424.wav	0.09	That is not bigotry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_001.wav	2.35	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_002.wav	4.35	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_005.wav	6.83	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we can go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_006.wav	6.19	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_007.wav	4.69	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_008.wav	8.28	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_009.wav	5.12	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_010.wav	4.01	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_011.wav	8.03	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_012.wav	5.72	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_013.wav	5.68	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_014.wav	5.00	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_015.wav	6.36	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_016.wav	6.44	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_017.wav	4.48	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_018.wav	5.59	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_019.wav	8.15	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_020.wav	4.61	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_021.wav	9.22	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_022.wav	8.06	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_023.wav	11.99	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_024.wav	7.68	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_025.wav	3.12	They will be dealt with.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_026.wav	3.12	It is never an easy game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_027.wav	3.29	This year it will be Billy Crystal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_028.wav	3.50	I intend to raise the matter there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_029.wav	3.59	However, it's good to turn the page.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_030.wav	3.67	We have to put this behind us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_031.wav	4.48	I thought it was quite good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_032.wav	3.33	It was important to win the singles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_033.wav	4.10	This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_034.wav	3.29	That is impressive by any standards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_035.wav	4.10	We are doing very well as we are.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_036.wav	3.97	The waiting is over, well almost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_037.wav	4.91	This was the performance, and the result they needed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_038.wav	3.89	I'm not allowed to say that, of course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_039.wav	4.10	It helped to get me noticed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_040.wav	2.82	They hit me in the head.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_041.wav	4.74	But he is not using them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_042.wav	4.14	That, though, was just the start of it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_043.wav	3.16	We are not moving in.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_044.wav	3.12	We have not had a formal request.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_045.wav	2.78	I never had a childhood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_046.wav	4.40	Its effect on humans is not yet known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_047.wav	3.29	We offered something different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_048.wav	4.10	We were very much a happy family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_049.wav	4.14	He was critically ill in hospital last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_050.wav	3.76	My brother is buried under there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_051.wav	5.17	Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_052.wav	2.26	What were they?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_053.wav	3.29	It was large enough to fit the wall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_054.wav	3.07	He will be judged by his actions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_055.wav	3.25	Her role in it was small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_056.wav	3.07	I have really noticed that this week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_057.wav	2.52	We might be back next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_058.wav	2.73	In a way he was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_059.wav	3.16	It's back to how it used to be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_060.wav	3.16	It is not a standing army.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_061.wav	3.67	The firm was down and almost out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_062.wav	3.20	They said they were only young men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_063.wav	2.86	I was chosen to do this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_064.wav	3.16	I learned a lot from that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_065.wav	3.25	The house was so well alight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_066.wav	2.44	He got his degree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_067.wav	2.61	Sandy was very active.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_068.wav	4.01	However, there is great potential in this right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_069.wav	4.48	We have no idea what caused the derailment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_070.wav	4.27	I am confident of the outcome this week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_071.wav	3.24	There were no formal announcements.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_072.wav	4.31	Before the games it was pretty open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_073.wav	3.21	It really has left the town in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_074.wav	3.33	But you can go beyond that condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_075.wav	3.29	I'm so worried about the roads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_076.wav	3.42	This was much worse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_077.wav	4.52	He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_078.wav	3.63	We are confident of taking that back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_079.wav	3.38	They must be kept on the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_080.wav	2.77	Did they give any good advice?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_081.wav	2.90	Who wants to be a millionaire?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_082.wav	2.82	This does not help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_083.wav	4.10	I've invented a village in East Lothian.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_084.wav	3.54	That's why the ministers resigned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_085.wav	3.46	He has lost confidence and weight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_086.wav	4.10	This process of attrition is expected to continue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_087.wav	3.76	Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_088.wav	3.16	This could be her way forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_089.wav	3.42	This gives us a lot of practice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_090.wav	3.89	The Parliament will make its own decisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_091.wav	3.71	It's a very, very special day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_092.wav	3.80	The crucial strike was yet to come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_093.wav	2.95	There's also the point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_094.wav	2.83	It was forced to divert.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_095.wav	3.46	Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_096.wav	3.12	That's the National Grid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_097.wav	3.37	But Allen is deadly serious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_098.wav	3.12	Peter doesn't want to leave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_099.wav	3.29	He wouldn't allow that to happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_100.wav	3.63	They have just got to believe in themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_101.wav	4.19	This is my personal assessment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_102.wav	2.73	There was no trouble at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_103.wav	2.39	Although, you never know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_104.wav	2.44	We shall be victorious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_105.wav	3.59	The quality of work is very impressive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_106.wav	3.67	However, he added there were signs of progress.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_107.wav	3.71	Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_108.wav	3.76	I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_109.wav	3.71	Nothing is being offered in exchange.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_110.wav	2.18	I took the gun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_111.wav	3.03	It's just one of those things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_112.wav	3.93	A web site is planned for November.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_113.wav	3.16	We played so well at times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_114.wav	2.78	I was very fortunate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_115.wav	3.37	Such a policy would be a disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_116.wav	3.07	We act because we must.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_117.wav	2.44	They will be destroyed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_118.wav	3.97	We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_119.wav	3.80	O Neill is reputed to have replied.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_120.wav	2.99	The Tory party will last.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_121.wav	3.07	It was a journey into a new life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_122.wav	2.82	It's a way of making a mark.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_123.wav	3.16	There is a great carry over value.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_124.wav	3.59	Life, as many people know it, in other words.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_125.wav	5.04	I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_126.wav	2.61	What's the point?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_127.wav	2.39	Why is this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_128.wav	3.67	What has changed since then?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_129.wav	3.97	Raymond was always on the outside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_130.wav	4.06	We need to make more inquiries about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_131.wav	3.29	I'd love to be at the World Cup.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_132.wav	4.10	He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_133.wav	2.48	I am sorry to hear this news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_134.wav	3.76	At some point, the bill will be presented.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_135.wav	2.52	I mean it happens.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_136.wav	3.37	This week is a perfect example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_137.wav	4.18	This performance has given my confidence a boost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_138.wav	3.54	Receiving this medal is an honour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_139.wav	4.44	Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_140.wav	3.80	But every two minutes it was exploding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_141.wav	3.25	That sort of thing is long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_142.wav	2.78	It is typical of me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_143.wav	3.85	However, consumers may take a different view.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_144.wav	3.20	They played it like a cup final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_145.wav	3.76	However, it is not all bad news for women.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_146.wav	4.23	But the championship is not over yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_147.wav	3.46	We haven't found out anything different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_148.wav	3.63	A review of the decision is being sought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_149.wav	3.80	It will be about commitment, not compliance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_150.wav	3.84	Still, in the end, it was a fair result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_151.wav	3.29	Surely it can do better than that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_152.wav	2.13	I am ashamed of them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_153.wav	3.50	Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_154.wav	3.55	The salary changes are long overdue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_155.wav	3.29	I, like an idiot, agreed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_156.wav	3.59	If so, we want to hear from them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_157.wav	2.69	I am not blaming audiences.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_158.wav	3.29	Who was on the panel?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_159.wav	2.78	They may differ on other issues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_160.wav	3.84	He had never run the distance before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_161.wav	3.97	I can make one further announcement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_162.wav	4.27	The General Election is all to play for.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_163.wav	2.82	It was a fiery game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_164.wav	3.55	Agents and coaches must be paid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_165.wav	3.76	Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_166.wav	4.14	Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_167.wav	3.33	It will not be easy for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_168.wav	3.16	This one is a special case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_169.wav	2.69	But what are the songs about?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_170.wav	3.76	There is a simmering anger out there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_171.wav	4.10	The ministers are now to make their decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_172.wav	3.76	That is not a position they enjoy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_173.wav	2.82	The stadium was full.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_174.wav	2.78	Dewar is the medium.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_175.wav	3.25	It was that kind of night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_176.wav	4.06	It is very much a matter for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_177.wav	3.37	Perhaps it is jealousy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_178.wav	3.72	Any error is severely punished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_179.wav	3.59	He's got a great chance of making it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_180.wav	2.31	We won't do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_181.wav	2.22	I hope we do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_182.wav	3.46	From now on there is no hiding place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_183.wav	3.55	I didn't want to ignore the punters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_184.wav	2.52	He quit in October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_185.wav	3.20	The United Nations must act.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_186.wav	3.80	Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_187.wav	2.82	Her daughter is getting married.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_188.wav	3.20	His manager blamed the referee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_189.wav	2.22	They were that poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_190.wav	3.97	Patients will be partners in decision making.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_191.wav	3.93	We have understood the problems for some time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_192.wav	3.59	Stan is a vital part of our future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_193.wav	3.08	All these things have an impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_194.wav	3.76	That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_195.wav	2.73	They believed it worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_196.wav	3.93	After that, though, we are still waiting to see.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_197.wav	2.86	They should feel ashamed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_198.wav	2.86	This is a really serious issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_199.wav	2.99	So they will settle again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_200.wav	3.12	How do we get more people in?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_201.wav	2.99	I'm just looking to take my chances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_202.wav	2.99	It looks as though there is no chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_203.wav	3.25	This is not a European Army.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_204.wav	4.01	Election results are expected soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_205.wav	2.48	So she told him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_206.wav	3.80	A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_207.wav	3.33	There are moments of honesty, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_208.wav	3.25	It was good to score the goal today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_209.wav	2.56	The night is young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_210.wav	3.76	Sadly, too, many of them are similar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_211.wav	3.03	I suspect that it will.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_212.wav	3.12	But there's no eye contact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_213.wav	3.38	The squad will be the same for France.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_214.wav	4.70	We are a party for people, not against people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_215.wav	4.27	Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_216.wav	3.84	We are still paying the price for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_217.wav	4.57	He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_218.wav	3.58	It is not a wish list.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_219.wav	4.10	He's very, very lucky to be alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_220.wav	3.37	Some of the players have not progressed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_221.wav	3.80	It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_222.wav	3.42	If not, he should go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_223.wav	4.36	We remain committed to it, as does the government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_224.wav	2.99	There is no margin for error.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_225.wav	3.84	This was not an easy meeting for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_226.wav	4.06	From our point of view, it is the right time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_227.wav	4.01	That figure will always remain with me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_228.wav	3.03	And then a funny thing happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_229.wav	2.60	It does not take much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_230.wav	2.56	She asked us a lot of questions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_231.wav	2.78	It was a stunning strike.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_232.wav	2.69	It is a technique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_233.wav	3.20	They hold on for many years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_234.wav	3.42	Is it the shape of things to come?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_235.wav	3.07	My body is exhausted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_236.wav	3.63	Home is in the Scottish Borders.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_237.wav	4.27	We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_238.wav	2.82	There is nothing to fear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_239.wav	2.82	I was an athlete.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_240.wav	3.37	Life was like a timetable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_241.wav	4.14	World leaders expressed their sympathy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_242.wav	2.91	I tried to push him away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_243.wav	3.84	It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_244.wav	3.59	This was done by the council staff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_245.wav	3.12	The truth is otherwise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_246.wav	3.29	We haven't come out of this very well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_247.wav	3.03	I wanted to put myself on the line.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_248.wav	3.29	I thought they could have made the gesture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_249.wav	3.63	We should be rewarded for producing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_250.wav	3.54	The bottom line is that this must stop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_251.wav	2.52	Which, in effect, it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_252.wav	2.73	The man became a reporter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_253.wav	2.69	It is a memorial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_254.wav	3.50	We feel it sends out the wrong message.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_255.wav	3.67	Our people are paying high prices.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_256.wav	3.67	The reason is partly because of tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_257.wav	3.25	Nor is it likely to do so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_258.wav	3.16	Or so everyone believed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_259.wav	2.69	Perhaps we should do the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_260.wav	2.60	I read it every year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_261.wav	4.01	He was in contention almost every week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_262.wav	4.01	Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_263.wav	2.52	It is up to Ann.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_264.wav	4.14	We are playing them at their own game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_265.wav	4.66	By this point the couple were approaching fast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_266.wav	3.50	I had trouble with the producers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_267.wav	3.71	So, it took me back to boarding school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_268.wav	3.84	They just thought it was extremely good acting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_269.wav	3.20	The conference is the first test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_270.wav	2.78	That's what we're trying to achieve.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_271.wav	3.38	I expect a rapid response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_272.wav	3.63	There was still more disquiet in Israel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_273.wav	2.48	There is no more money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_274.wav	2.69	My mother is a widow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_275.wav	3.63	The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_276.wav	4.05	There have been different reports from different people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_277.wav	3.03	It's an absolute disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_278.wav	3.12	Something was plainly wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_279.wav	3.29	Why should he go anywhere?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_280.wav	2.44	One thing is sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_281.wav	3.16	It was a foolhardy decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_282.wav	3.33	I'm confident we can do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_283.wav	2.95	Funding needs to be long term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_284.wav	3.08	It's funny how it comes and goes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_285.wav	3.25	I would never even consider it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_286.wav	3.63	We are talking about the outskirts of London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_287.wav	3.54	The end result is precisely the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_288.wav	2.56	We have it on video.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_289.wav	4.10	I am not a threat to coaches.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_290.wav	3.97	Painful, but only because it's true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_291.wav	3.54	It's never over until it's over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_292.wav	4.10	Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_293.wav	3.46	This year, it was a little different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_294.wav	3.12	That, though, is to miss the point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_295.wav	2.69	We gave them the goal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_296.wav	3.50	Is being naturally funny enough?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_297.wav	2.70	What's the point of staying sober?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_298.wav	3.80	We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_299.wav	3.97	The incident is being taken seriously.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_300.wav	3.84	So what's the shape, and what's the detail?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_301.wav	4.53	They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_302.wav	2.94	I can feel the sound inside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_303.wav	3.93	I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_304.wav	2.86	I am not a fan of books.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_305.wav	3.54	SO now we know the secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_306.wav	2.99	It may well have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_307.wav	4.31	I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_308.wav	2.91	It was a simple question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_309.wav	4.14	I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_310.wav	2.82	And we have beaten them before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_311.wav	3.08	Could you put it in writing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_312.wav	2.69	I am not a paedophile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_313.wav	3.50	Some of their movement was excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_314.wav	2.99	But they had to be paid for.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_315.wav	3.46	The odds are that it will.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_316.wav	3.55	But then they scored their fourth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_317.wav	3.16	They deserve a lot of credit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_318.wav	4.35	That is the position the MoD has adopted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_319.wav	2.35	Why is that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_320.wav	2.91	Then came the crunch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_321.wav	3.93	But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_322.wav	3.08	But will they fall in love?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_323.wav	2.73	As if they ever stopped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_324.wav	3.50	The referee had a shocking game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_325.wav	3.41	Players are fighting to stay in the team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_326.wav	3.46	For a few years we had good fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_327.wav	3.67	Medical staff are with them at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_328.wav	3.63	It went on to become an annual event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_329.wav	4.14	This is the logic of punishment assaults.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_330.wav	3.29	We are now in an election period.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_331.wav	3.46	Everyone is too upset to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_332.wav	3.33	Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_333.wav	2.69	But when we do it is great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_334.wav	3.29	She has nothing to say to journalists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_335.wav	3.29	I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_336.wav	2.82	He pleaded for caution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_337.wav	3.63	I disagree entirely with the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_338.wav	3.16	They've been wonderful to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_339.wav	2.74	I can't believe the buzz.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_340.wav	3.76	I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_341.wav	4.14	The picture is the same across Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_342.wav	3.80	When it comes down to it, this is a job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_343.wav	3.37	It's no less intriguing, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_344.wav	3.33	It's a question of perception.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_345.wav	3.54	Staff have been informed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_346.wav	3.07	My heart is not so sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_347.wav	3.29	This morning was very quiet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_348.wav	3.54	On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_349.wav	3.71	It has been handled entirely properly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_350.wav	3.50	I shall be voting Yes to support him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_351.wav	2.90	That might help a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_352.wav	3.71	Two others were also seriously injured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_353.wav	4.14	He was made redundant in February last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_354.wav	3.72	Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_355.wav	4.95	Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_356.wav	3.41	You have obviously got an answer to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_357.wav	2.65	It seems very odd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_358.wav	2.69	Closure is not one of them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_359.wav	2.78	The hotel was huge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_360.wav	3.71	A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_361.wav	2.89	Well, you can have a tree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_362.wav	2.50	It was the same at Twickenham.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_363.wav	3.46	This is an internal matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_364.wav	4.01	I am amazed at what he's done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_365.wav	2.69	They took a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_366.wav	3.37	The idea was presented to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_367.wav	3.33	The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_368.wav	3.89	He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_369.wav	3.72	His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_370.wav	3.50	The hearing was fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_371.wav	2.74	I see it as my job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_372.wav	3.67	This was not a summit about the euro.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_373.wav	3.16	Frank Warren is a great man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_374.wav	3.08	I am a little bit tired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_375.wav	2.90	That was never their agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_376.wav	2.35	She died at her home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_377.wav	3.16	She is currently in foster care.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_378.wav	2.90	That's the only thing that matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_379.wav	3.03	I enjoy the creative process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_380.wav	4.57	They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_381.wav	3.54	It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_382.wav	4.14	As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_383.wav	3.08	It's always the same, isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_384.wav	3.07	We have been preparing all year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_385.wav	2.82	We could learn a lot from them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_386.wav	2.86	I can't wait for the outdoors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_387.wav	2.86	Sure, we have problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_388.wav	3.42	I was released after six days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_389.wav	2.95	That time is not far away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_390.wav	3.20	I may think about performing it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_391.wav	3.72	There are a number of possible outcomes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_392.wav	2.95	We also enjoyed a lot of support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_393.wav	3.33	This is the last thing we ever expected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_394.wav	3.08	You can't go back and change things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_395.wav	4.10	It is time to fight a decisive battle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_396.wav	2.99	Of course, it is a tough assignment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_397.wav	3.29	Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_398.wav	2.90	He says it often enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_399.wav	3.59	Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_400.wav	2.78	His primary residence is Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_401.wav	3.16	I found that much more challenging.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_402.wav	3.33	This fight is not going to go away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_403.wav	3.33	It would have been very easily done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_404.wav	3.59	I will never manage another Scottish club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_405.wav	2.48	The Open champion is back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_406.wav	2.95	It's going to be a new challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_407.wav	2.56	As, indeed, they would be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_408.wav	2.43	I want to keep him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_409.wav	2.52	He deserves a top team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_410.wav	2.86	I knew people on that committee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_411.wav	3.33	The next eight weeks are critical to us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_412.wav	3.12	Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_413.wav	2.56	Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_414.wav	2.31	We never agreed to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_415.wav	3.63	But that night they killed her housekeeper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_416.wav	3.20	But it's not the end of Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_417.wav	3.29	Sightings were replaced by rumours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_418.wav	2.82	Would they work together again?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_419.wav	2.86	I didn't play all that well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_420.wav	2.39	Who can tell?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_421.wav	3.42	It appears to have been closed down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_422.wav	3.50	Now, that is a good deal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_423.wav	3.20	The whole nation will be delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p318\p318_424.wav	4.22	We have no plans for direct action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_001.wav	2.10	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_002.wav	3.63	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_003.wav	9.22	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_004.wav	6.36	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_005.wav	7.56	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_006.wav	7.17	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_007.wav	7.05	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_008.wav	9.56	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_009.wav	7.08	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_010.wav	4.06	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_011.wav	8.53	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_012.wav	6.27	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_013.wav	5.55	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_014.wav	5.59	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_015.wav	7.21	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_016.wav	8.36	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_017.wav	4.35	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_018.wav	6.62	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_019.wav	9.73	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_020.wav	4.87	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_021.wav	12.34	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_022.wav	8.58	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_023.wav	13.95	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_024.wav	7.43	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_025.wav	3.25	We've made a couple of albums.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_026.wav	3.72	Film music was never the same again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_027.wav	3.80	It was a deeply moving musical experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_028.wav	3.03	Now it is much easier.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_029.wav	5.04	However, on the other hand, in principle it is plainly wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_030.wav	3.12	This is the best way to do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_031.wav	3.16	Its role is not to interfere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_032.wav	3.42	Leisure centres were also affected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_033.wav	3.50	Something happened on that island.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_034.wav	4.99	Meantime, the department is proposing structural changes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_035.wav	5.21	Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_036.wav	3.12	It is misleading to compare the two.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_037.wav	3.46	They discussed how he might get involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_038.wav	5.55	And this perception might find an unlikely supporter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_039.wav	2.77	And it had two seats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_040.wav	2.95	They were not up to speed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_041.wav	4.40	We know the quality of life goes up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_042.wav	2.26	What is next?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_043.wav	3.29	Now they have found out the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_044.wav	2.90	We've still got a say in this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_045.wav	3.84	The first was excluding Sinn Fein.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_046.wav	2.86	Horses are drawn by ballot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_047.wav	3.38	We have our supporters and our enemies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_048.wav	4.05	Mackie was at home, unable to watch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_049.wav	3.50	So, what's it about?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_050.wav	3.42	We have been let down by these people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_051.wav	2.86	What's it for?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_052.wav	4.82	Nor does he have any desire to be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_053.wav	2.43	How well did they get on?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_054.wav	3.46	I don't think it is a drawback.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_055.wav	3.97	He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_056.wav	2.65	They may have been murdered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_057.wav	4.27	However this weekend it will be different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_058.wav	3.54	We didn't try hard enough, that is all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_059.wav	3.84	It also condemned the suicide bombers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_060.wav	3.71	I think that's a bit of an invasion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_061.wav	2.65	It is very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_062.wav	3.63	This is the place to play football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_063.wav	4.10	But it was a great decision he joked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_064.wav	3.42	Then they killed another three.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_065.wav	4.31	What the Department of Transport will make clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_066.wav	3.20	The six others were injured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_067.wav	3.50	Most of the others were in their twenties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_068.wav	3.42	We were beaten by the better team today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_069.wav	3.76	You need a long-term strategy in football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_070.wav	4.23	They are not the answer to staff shortages.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_071.wav	3.88	The law has got to be upheld.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_072.wav	4.10	Advice and counselling will be offered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_073.wav	3.97	I mean they have just been a disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_074.wav	2.78	He's a joy to follow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_075.wav	2.99	That is my personal view.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_076.wav	4.10	He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_077.wav	3.42	I saw the explosion and panicked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_078.wav	3.20	The protest will go ahead as planned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_079.wav	2.99	The punishment was swift.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_080.wav	3.16	Who will run the bigger show?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_081.wav	4.18	General, You didn't get a modified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_082.wav	5.59	It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_083.wav	2.99	These things just happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_084.wav	4.48	And, within itself, it is visionary.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_085.wav	2.69	Are you up for business?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_086.wav	4.02	It's an interesting debate to get going.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_087.wav	3.84	Who does he think will win?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_088.wav	3.72	I enjoyed my work in the Scottish Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_089.wav	3.89	An announcement will follow in due course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_090.wav	3.59	You are not in any kind of trouble.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_091.wav	4.27	It also makes for interesting viewing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_092.wav	2.39	Will they fall out?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_093.wav	4.61	Scotland came very close in the second Test.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_094.wav	3.16	He was not able to talk to us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_095.wav	5.98	Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_096.wav	2.90	There is no conflict of interest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_097.wav	3.42	They want to shut the Scottish Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_098.wav	2.48	They are not suitable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_099.wav	2.73	It does seem a mystery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_100.wav	3.80	But he is something special, is he not?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_101.wav	3.46	Club rugby refuses to die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_102.wav	3.93	That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_103.wav	3.42	He could look after himself, but didn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_104.wav	3.93	The decision was designed to shock investors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_105.wav	4.83	There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_106.wav	3.46	We are not dealing here with refugees.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_107.wav	3.37	It's up to their parents to choose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_108.wav	3.42	I've had a very long run.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_109.wav	4.70	It was just another race, and yesterday is history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_110.wav	3.85	He later paid a tribute to his opponent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_111.wav	5.33	Football is very easy, you have to work for the team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_112.wav	2.52	It doesn't make them evil.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_113.wav	3.84	I have played really well all year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_114.wav	3.29	We were a shambles at the back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_115.wav	3.89	Parts of the system are already overstretched.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_116.wav	3.46	No passengers were on board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_117.wav	4.61	It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_118.wav	4.05	If it does it means he has failed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_119.wav	4.99	She added, It is the same story in both countries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_120.wav	3.46	We have a high quality product.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_121.wav	3.63	A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_122.wav	4.57	However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_123.wav	4.65	Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_124.wav	3.54	It will also take evidence from consumers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_125.wav	2.39	I have been to see him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_126.wav	3.54	I try not to expect anything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_127.wav	3.29	I would never say anything against her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_128.wav	4.74	He probably would not have added, mainly by me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_129.wav	3.72	Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_130.wav	3.33	I see no need for change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_131.wav	3.33	We are in a very strong position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_132.wav	3.59	This will have no effect on the championship.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_133.wav	3.89	We didn't turn it into the inspectors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_134.wav	4.18	It was no more than they deserved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_135.wav	3.67	Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_136.wav	4.06	I'm just glad that no-one was hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_137.wav	3.42	Everything was a dead end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_138.wav	3.63	It's been a long, long journey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_139.wav	2.65	I can give no comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_140.wav	4.23	Well, until recently he didn't think so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_141.wav	3.41	What exactly is your job?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_142.wav	3.37	They would love to do more films.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_143.wav	2.82	She is now planning a visit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_144.wav	3.50	New blood is essential for progress.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_145.wav	4.95	It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_146.wav	3.03	Boy is the town a mess.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_147.wav	2.74	Do yourselves a favour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_148.wav	4.35	Substantial pockets of resistance remain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_149.wav	3.80	I said, What does this mean?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_150.wav	5.80	Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_151.wav	2.78	We can do both.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_152.wav	3.97	What's it got to do with art?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_153.wav	5.04	It is a very disturbing picture for men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_154.wav	5.04	I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_155.wav	3.93	The encounter was to change his life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_156.wav	3.63	They should not have behaved in that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_157.wav	3.08	I've never seen them down here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_158.wav	3.42	The motive for the shooting was not known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_159.wav	2.82	I got off to a great start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_160.wav	3.63	It's the best of both worlds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_161.wav	3.37	That is our unfinished business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_162.wav	3.33	I don't know what we're doing wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_163.wav	5.34	It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_164.wav	3.33	But it was to no avail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_165.wav	5.63	We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_166.wav	4.82	There are so many people to thank.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_167.wav	3.88	Nato has left them with no other option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_168.wav	5.08	I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_169.wav	5.25	Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_170.wav	2.99	The stakes are high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_171.wav	4.31	I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_172.wav	4.14	It was not a beautiful game, was it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_173.wav	3.59	That's just the way the game is evolving.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_174.wav	4.40	Michael is putting on a brave face.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_175.wav	4.10	We have done a deal with IMPACT.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_176.wav	4.14	O Leary was clearly disgusted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_177.wav	3.37	What do they do, anyway?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_178.wav	4.36	The next thing will be cutting journey times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_179.wav	5.25	In the eyes of the supporters, there has been a betrayal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_180.wav	4.91	They were later released, and last night were staying with relatives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_181.wav	2.95	This is a mental challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_182.wav	3.72	He was married with children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_183.wav	4.18	They prefer the short, intensive session.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_184.wav	3.80	It would be difficult to argue with that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_185.wav	3.97	He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_186.wav	2.86	The game is now open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_187.wav	5.04	Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_188.wav	5.72	Rather than just a way in, she begins with an entrance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_189.wav	4.27	Nothing like this has ever happened here before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_190.wav	3.20	It is time to come into the limelight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_191.wav	6.23	However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_192.wav	4.14	According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_193.wav	3.03	We have got to get it right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_194.wav	3.08	You could see he was thinking about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_195.wav	4.10	Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_196.wav	2.48	We work for the athlete.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_197.wav	2.69	It was a good atmosphere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_198.wav	3.33	It was published yesterday on the internet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_199.wav	2.43	It was an accounting error.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_200.wav	5.94	The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_201.wav	2.82	It has never been worthwhile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_202.wav	2.91	She is not in a coma.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_203.wav	3.37	There is no reason to put me out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_204.wav	4.44	We begin, as ever, with a reminder of the end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_205.wav	3.29	So other options had to be explored.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_206.wav	5.13	But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_207.wav	4.95	He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_208.wav	3.16	Post offices are closing now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_209.wav	2.82	I am pretty careful with money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_210.wav	2.69	People love to see this stuff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_211.wav	4.44	One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_212.wav	3.63	It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_213.wav	3.84	Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_214.wav	3.67	His female companion was being treated for shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_215.wav	3.12	Is being naturally funny enough?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_216.wav	3.20	Lack of pace is his big problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_217.wav	3.24	I have no plans to change the oath.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_218.wav	3.08	The process itself has taken over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_219.wav	3.20	We had a huge response to that campaign.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_220.wav	3.25	We did not even get a free kick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_221.wav	3.12	He was married with a young child.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_222.wav	5.34	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_223.wav	3.16	I became a widow overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_224.wav	3.29	We aren't going to play better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_225.wav	2.91	That was the case with David.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_226.wav	2.73	They loved it and it showed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_227.wav	2.26	But who cares?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_228.wav	3.24	She became a heroine of my childhood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_229.wav	2.39	That period was a struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_230.wav	3.58	I am sure all schools would accept that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_231.wav	2.82	I am an estate agent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_232.wav	4.10	The conference will run from Wednesday until Sunday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_233.wav	4.53	He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_234.wav	3.46	Is your life a little too easy?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_235.wav	3.25	I think my game is suited to grass.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_236.wav	3.80	Anything can happen - at any moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_237.wav	4.23	He predicted the contest would be very close.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_238.wav	2.14	Who can say?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_239.wav	3.12	My life would be a lot less restrictive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_240.wav	3.93	The key issue for us is public safety.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_241.wav	3.84	Nobody wants to stop people enjoying themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_242.wav	3.33	I went home and wrote about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_243.wav	3.80	The result could be all down to turnout.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_244.wav	3.38	Industry leaders reacted angrily.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_245.wav	2.56	There were no violations.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_246.wav	2.95	It appears to have been closed down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_247.wav	3.16	Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_248.wav	3.72	These are exciting times for young Scottish players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_249.wav	2.99	People want to see me on the screen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_250.wav	2.99	So far he has not done so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_251.wav	2.48	Maybe they will show it next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_252.wav	5.21	The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_253.wav	3.63	And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_254.wav	2.43	Everything is up for grabs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_255.wav	4.06	Thankfully, for me, the matter is now closed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_256.wav	2.48	We are a new department.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_257.wav	2.18	Are we here?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_258.wav	4.27	The conversion didn't go over either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_259.wav	3.80	He said to me, Which one, son?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_260.wav	2.82	There is nothing sinister in it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_261.wav	4.02	They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_262.wav	3.41	I've got to provide for my family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_263.wav	3.20	It is having a big impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_264.wav	3.20	That is very hard, alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_265.wav	2.78	It's a very high number.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_266.wav	3.20	I was not happy about being left out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_267.wav	3.08	Such debate is pointless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_268.wav	2.86	It is a very beautiful city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_269.wav	2.26	The same goes for Russia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_270.wav	2.73	What do you think of the hair?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_271.wav	2.86	It is not great art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_272.wav	2.91	You do not change overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_273.wav	2.65	We have to break that cycle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_274.wav	4.57	The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_275.wav	4.10	Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_276.wav	3.16	Scotland had great assets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_277.wav	5.98	One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_278.wav	4.78	Meantime, his appointment has been widely welcomed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_279.wav	5.80	Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_280.wav	2.39	Have a look at our accounts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_281.wav	4.61	We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_282.wav	2.39	It all changes for her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_283.wav	2.86	We aim to put them out of business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_284.wav	2.99	Is it a threat to union?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_285.wav	3.85	We also have to work the dark side, if you will.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_286.wav	4.48	We remain confident that Danny is still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_287.wav	2.99	Tony Blair should get out more.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_288.wav	2.60	We need to increase the membership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_289.wav	3.20	Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_290.wav	4.44	We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_291.wav	2.99	He was just awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_292.wav	2.90	No decision has yet been made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_293.wav	2.52	Maybe his time has gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_294.wav	3.80	She died in hospital two hours later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_295.wav	4.36	She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_296.wav	3.37	I have never seen anything like it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_297.wav	2.01	I've got the shirt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_298.wav	3.08	Both were later released after a check-up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_299.wav	3.03	We were a little bit nervous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_300.wav	4.06	And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_301.wav	3.89	However, many questions remained unanswered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_302.wav	2.69	I first met him last summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_303.wav	3.21	Detection is often difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_304.wav	2.78	How good is Lennox Lewis?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_305.wav	3.63	I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_306.wav	2.91	I would ask the fans to be patient.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_307.wav	3.25	The plot is changing as time goes on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_308.wav	2.14	We have other options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_309.wav	2.90	I don't want to hear any excuses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_310.wav	3.54	The son has autism and other problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_311.wav	2.48	This makes up for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_312.wav	2.31	I'm very puzzled by it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_313.wav	3.67	Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_314.wav	3.67	Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_315.wav	3.37	All things are possible if you believe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_316.wav	2.95	The council's concern is very simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_317.wav	3.20	This was not just incongruous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_318.wav	2.73	This rule is archaic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_319.wav	2.82	Rangers didn't turn up, by the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_320.wav	2.09	It was a virus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_321.wav	3.20	My mother was getting on at me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_322.wav	2.99	But it wasn't to be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_323.wav	4.52	And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_324.wav	3.54	She is an expert on medical ethics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_325.wav	3.08	Then there is the terrain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_326.wav	2.78	We will deal with the refugees.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_327.wav	2.82	It's such a shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_328.wav	4.27	The pair are no strangers to smashing records.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_329.wav	2.99	I didn't know there was anything wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_330.wav	2.61	It was very well received.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_331.wav	2.61	If you could find it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_332.wav	3.07	Such is the ego involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_333.wav	2.90	She was totally possessed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_334.wav	2.69	It was not known to myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_335.wav	3.76	He is wanted by German police for questioning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_336.wav	2.56	It is a vicious circle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_337.wav	4.44	He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_338.wav	2.52	We work on the same level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_339.wav	3.63	Angola was a really hard place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_340.wav	2.82	It is a love affair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_341.wav	2.91	I was loving that little girl.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_342.wav	2.65	Everyone thought they were safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_343.wav	3.84	People wouldn't have quite understood the language.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_344.wav	3.33	We don't just play golf in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_345.wav	3.16	That's why the young musicians have joined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_346.wav	4.05	If they have City backing, what is the influence?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_347.wav	3.07	Before the game we went for a pint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_348.wav	2.91	The auction will be held tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_349.wav	3.20	There is no credible official announcement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_350.wav	4.53	However, pensions and salaries have yet to be settled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_351.wav	3.63	I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_352.wav	3.54	I'm trying to stay open on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_353.wav	3.08	At the same time it is a satire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_354.wav	3.16	He died at the hands of his captors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_355.wav	3.97	Talks will then resume again in the autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_356.wav	3.33	I understand the medical concerns.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_357.wav	3.20	Yet the survey has been cautious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_358.wav	2.99	This is a United Kingdom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_359.wav	3.24	I thought it was a fantastic game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_360.wav	3.54	This is a critical time for football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_361.wav	4.06	Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_362.wav	5.81	Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_363.wav	3.20	I think she is supreme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_364.wav	4.10	However, who could have predicted this result?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_365.wav	4.53	Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_366.wav	4.74	As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_367.wav	3.24	But we're not the same person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_368.wav	2.94	There are simply no orders.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_369.wav	3.16	They were behind the wheel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_370.wav	4.18	The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_371.wav	4.57	The problem arises because he does so much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_372.wav	3.54	This is totally out of character for Stuart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_373.wav	3.46	PR will be just one of them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_374.wav	2.69	The answer is mayhem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_375.wav	2.95	But the fans deserve to know!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_376.wav	3.67	Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_377.wav	2.44	He asked how they were doing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_378.wav	3.33	We have been extremely lucky this time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_379.wav	2.35	I'll have to work on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_380.wav	2.82	He must be seen to be impartial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_381.wav	4.27	They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_382.wav	2.22	That will be the sweetness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_383.wav	2.48	The law will take its course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_384.wav	3.46	The idea has potential for the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_385.wav	4.10	But is it ethical to practice in humans?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_386.wav	4.05	I don't have any more contact with Airdrie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_387.wav	3.03	There was a fossil on screen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_388.wav	4.78	I always loved the lightning in the movies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_389.wav	3.72	I did not concentrate on my performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_390.wav	3.63	There is great interest on our island.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_391.wav	3.50	Later they changed their minds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_392.wav	3.41	This does not create any precedent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_393.wav	4.78	Hours later, she was found dead by Ms Wilson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_394.wav	3.12	I want to go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_395.wav	3.12	He already had had complaints.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_396.wav	4.61	That, however, was only the tip of the iceberg.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_397.wav	2.14	Of course he does!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_398.wav	3.84	I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_399.wav	3.03	The racist abuse was terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_400.wav	3.25	The Farmer is called an idiot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_401.wav	3.29	Five officers were injured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_402.wav	3.59	You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_403.wav	3.07	We didn't make any of this up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_404.wav	3.71	Ms Jackson was not at the meeting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_405.wav	3.20	The house was full of smoke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_406.wav	3.46	A decision about that will be made today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_407.wav	3.46	The early evidence suggests he did not.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_408.wav	4.57	It is too pretty, it is too small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_409.wav	4.40	Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_410.wav	3.37	Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_411.wav	3.76	We are seeking funds from government departments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_412.wav	2.60	Last night, the row continued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_413.wav	4.74	That, though, was again according to manager McCall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_414.wav	2.86	Now it's all written down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_415.wav	3.37	The Dutchman was suspended for two games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_416.wav	2.86	There is a spring in the step.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_417.wav	2.86	It's been a humbling year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_418.wav	3.20	We tend to come good at the end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_419.wav	3.29	I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_420.wav	3.80	The commission is not the only loser.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_421.wav	4.23	As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_422.wav	2.01	I wish it well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_423.wav	3.16	Harold is a rarity.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p323\p323_424.wav	0.60	I want him to take on Gomez.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_001.wav	2.56	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_002.wav	3.84	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_003.wav	7.00	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_004.wav	7.22	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_005.wav	8.71	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_006.wav	7.86	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_007.wav	5.46	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_008.wav	9.60	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_009.wav	4.35	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_010.wav	2.88	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_011.wav	7.90	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_012.wav	6.36	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_013.wav	3.86	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_014.wav	5.21	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_015.wav	5.84	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_016.wav	7.04	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_017.wav	3.29	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_018.wav	6.27	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_019.wav	9.60	Since then physicists have found it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_020.wav	4.67	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_021.wav	9.44	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_022.wav	10.12	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_023.wav	11.27	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_024.wav	6.06	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_025.wav	6.02	Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_026.wav	1.74	The message was clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_027.wav	2.13	She is an angel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_028.wav	3.20	It is believed he had been stabbed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_029.wav	3.16	We have got to attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_030.wav	3.97	I saw the other car coming, but could do nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_031.wav	4.70	United were in control without always being dominant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_032.wav	2.68	There we were on the first tee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_033.wav	3.37	Roy Keane is certainly the best.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_034.wav	3.38	At least two women were among those arrested.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_035.wav	2.99	How would it work?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_036.wav	3.76	It was my shortest audition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_037.wav	4.18	That was a stunning drive from Jon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_038.wav	3.08	She didn't tell us anything new.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_039.wav	3.40	There is nothing like this back home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_040.wav	3.20	The police believe the man was not injured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_041.wav	2.48	It would be a miracle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_042.wav	2.86	We just love to chat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_043.wav	3.20	I read about it in the newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_044.wav	3.29	What did they think of her voice?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_045.wav	2.91	They say they feel different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_046.wav	3.20	It is a good result for Great Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_047.wav	3.50	What on earth is wrong with you?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_048.wav	3.46	We will continue to pressure the Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_049.wav	3.21	His art was not just about emotions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_050.wav	4.05	They are all bright and different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_051.wav	3.25	I found a fault and worked at it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_052.wav	2.82	My position on the euro is quite clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_053.wav	3.33	Labour was too busy to respond.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_054.wav	2.48	His voice is strong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_055.wav	2.74	They may yet have the last laugh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_056.wav	2.01	But they add up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_057.wav	3.03	You can feel at home in China.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_058.wav	3.37	It is the wealthiest in Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_059.wav	3.46	This is all part of opening the door.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_060.wav	3.54	Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_061.wav	2.86	Mr Blunkett was convinced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_062.wav	4.14	For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_063.wav	2.82	He will become the sovereign.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_064.wav	3.16	It was a foolhardy decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_065.wav	3.46	Washington is consumed by the crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_066.wav	4.44	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_067.wav	3.21	There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_068.wav	3.67	Everyone could see it apart from Kevin Keegan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_069.wav	3.67	For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_070.wav	3.33	Messages have to be reinforced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_071.wav	3.59	The success story shows no signs of stopping.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_072.wav	4.31	Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_073.wav	2.37	The Insider opens tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_074.wav	3.24	More patience and composure was required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_075.wav	3.42	It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_076.wav	2.69	I was shocked and outraged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_077.wav	3.08	It's just gotten too big.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_078.wav	3.93	We're still in talks and, hopefully, they will continue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_079.wav	3.25	I am immensely proud of them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_080.wav	2.06	It was extremely cold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_081.wav	3.75	The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_082.wav	3.97	No, we had nothing to do with the Jews.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_083.wav	3.50	There will be tough opponents to this report.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_084.wav	3.59	They were two different types.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_085.wav	2.69	Chelsea was a great club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_086.wav	3.42	I can't believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_087.wav	4.27	I couldn't believe it, but it looks like it's true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_088.wav	2.65	We have them in offices all over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_089.wav	2.69	It need not be like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_090.wav	3.54	There has been a sense of frustration.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_091.wav	3.59	At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_092.wav	5.38	Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_093.wav	2.72	This time, there were no such rewards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_094.wav	2.78	That'd be good for the whole city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_095.wav	3.33	It is, honestly, difficult to write about this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_096.wav	2.52	We are very very proud of Alain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_097.wav	4.36	Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_098.wav	2.99	It was exactly four months away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_099.wav	3.46	The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_100.wav	2.60	It was set in a cafe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_101.wav	2.22	It certainly gives you hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_102.wav	3.03	If he does not leave, he will be shot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_103.wav	4.14	Brown is an interesting man, but he's not desperate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_104.wav	2.79	We've all been there at some point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_105.wav	2.86	I'm totally horrified by the sentence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_106.wav	2.86	Our people should be immune.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_107.wav	3.93	It's a metaphor for consumption.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_108.wav	4.35	I just saw them for a few minutes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_109.wav	4.53	A management agreement, however, was conceded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_110.wav	2.43	It left me with a sadness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_111.wav	3.08	Hopefully they will turn out tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_112.wav	2.69	The boys are very confident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_113.wav	4.10	The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_114.wav	2.57	Thousands of others have not been so fortunate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_115.wav	3.37	Our objective is to tackle poverty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_116.wav	2.60	What she will do next?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_117.wav	2.90	Hopefully, everything is for the best.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_118.wav	4.40	Two things will count for us in Brussels.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_119.wav	4.70	She has now been registered as disabled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_120.wav	2.86	Today's meeting was open and friendly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_121.wav	3.39	Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_122.wav	3.30	It is the stop-gap before extinction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_123.wav	4.10	That is a data management problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_124.wav	4.27	Nor is he allowed out without permission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_125.wav	2.44	He looked very sharp.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_126.wav	3.72	Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_127.wav	2.91	I've beaten her a few times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_128.wav	3.17	His father and mother are in film production.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_129.wav	4.91	This is not a long-term commitment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_130.wav	2.99	It's about attitudes to change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_131.wav	3.33	They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_132.wav	2.43	Yet she is one of the lucky ones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_133.wav	4.82	Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_134.wav	4.40	That means no more taxation by stealth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_135.wav	4.86	History may repeat itself with Billy Elliot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_136.wav	3.93	Mr Campbell received a phone call.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_137.wav	4.01	People tended to stay there for some time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_138.wav	3.42	Holland won by five wickets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_139.wav	4.10	His expulsion would not solve the problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_140.wav	5.59	After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_141.wav	3.24	We are not going to forget.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_142.wav	1.74	I'm the one that said it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_143.wav	3.16	It's not hard to get involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_144.wav	2.69	I've grown up a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_145.wav	4.27	For a moment it was all about her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_146.wav	2.91	It changed my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_147.wav	4.23	Once they go away they won't come back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_148.wav	2.63	It's a difficult one to comment on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_149.wav	2.61	Our position is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_150.wav	2.48	Yet it does not lose appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_151.wav	3.03	But what will we put on it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_152.wav	5.29	Then in came a succession of signings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_153.wav	3.41	It will benefit a lot of people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_154.wav	2.86	A new school will be built.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_155.wav	2.95	The main thing is that they enjoy it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_156.wav	5.63	It is worse because she suffers from angina.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_157.wav	2.78	I felt he was excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_158.wav	3.07	It's not just a male agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_159.wav	2.90	This meeting is the path to salvation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_160.wav	4.19	I think we believed the tie was won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_161.wav	2.44	She wanted to move.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_162.wav	3.46	How do you find the youngsters?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_163.wav	2.86	It's always a rehearsal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_164.wav	2.44	But it's a subtle process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_165.wav	3.25	We all have to look in the mirror.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_166.wav	3.29	There is no internal damage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_167.wav	3.93	About the bad things that happened to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_168.wav	4.44	She is a very lucky young lady.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_169.wav	3.63	It was a great team effort.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_170.wav	3.93	The threat to rural areas is real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_171.wav	2.91	Tourism continues to struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_172.wav	4.14	That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_173.wav	3.27	Its first awards will do just that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_174.wav	3.80	We are already under pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_175.wav	3.42	She didn't tell me anything the night before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_176.wav	4.19	In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_177.wav	3.71	The Scottish management team will settle for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_178.wav	4.14	THE US is a diverse and colourful nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_179.wav	3.07	He didn't have long to wait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_180.wav	3.42	That was merely their initial problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_181.wav	3.15	I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_182.wav	3.84	It would be really interesting if they did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_183.wav	2.16	I need them to set my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_184.wav	4.57	I love the Scottish and the Irish people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_185.wav	5.25	They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_186.wav	2.78	He was all blackened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_187.wav	2.44	This is your country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_188.wav	3.38	I want to be there by right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_189.wav	2.86	The fund has three elements.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_190.wav	2.13	You've just got to move on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_191.wav	2.18	I feel really good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_192.wav	3.46	So You Think You Want  to be Victoria?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_193.wav	4.05	This is still a young team, you know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_194.wav	4.35	It's just the workings of the Scottish media.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_195.wav	3.72	The British government said she was coming home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_196.wav	2.52	It's not even finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_197.wav	4.35	That is a matter for Mr Graham.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_198.wav	3.63	These people just lost their child.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_199.wav	2.60	Everyone knew where they were.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_200.wav	4.10	It may now be too expensive for anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_201.wav	2.86	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_202.wav	3.29	The processing plant was closed yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_203.wav	3.67	For the moment, our position remains the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_204.wav	2.90	Was this a new event?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_205.wav	4.35	As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_206.wav	2.99	In the old days, it was easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_207.wav	2.82	I came into this world with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_208.wav	3.84	We're still hopeful of concluding the deal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_209.wav	2.99	I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_210.wav	5.38	River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_211.wav	2.47	Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_212.wav	3.41	His style is suited to Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_213.wav	3.33	After that he became more romantic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_214.wav	2.35	It's not long enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_215.wav	2.48	My view has now completely changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_216.wav	3.37	You're going to take away my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_217.wav	3.33	He scored a touchdown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_218.wav	2.90	They finished second and third.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_219.wav	3.16	We're playing away from home and that's it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_220.wav	3.16	He was then replaced by Ross.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_221.wav	2.87	It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_222.wav	4.69	I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_223.wav	3.21	She did not attend the courtroom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_224.wav	3.25	People can get them if they want.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_225.wav	3.97	Smith confirmed that their confidence was returning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_226.wav	2.09	He is a law unto himself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_227.wav	2.95	I was very, very happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_228.wav	2.58	No-one should see that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_229.wav	4.14	We are going to go about our lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_230.wav	3.50	What is the point of jailing him?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_231.wav	4.31	They made it very difficult for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_232.wav	3.50	Well, there is a bed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_233.wav	3.16	You write a play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_234.wav	3.55	There are no easy solutions to this problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_235.wav	3.33	The Government faces a moral dilemma.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_236.wav	3.12	Seems a sensible compromise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_237.wav	3.03	This kind of traffic is commonplace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_238.wav	2.56	I'm happy with the outcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_239.wav	4.18	An aide was instructed to get a copy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_240.wav	3.88	The Allies intend to maintain the average.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_241.wav	3.71	Agents and coaches must be paid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_242.wav	3.80	The vacancies are in support services and arts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_243.wav	4.10	It is just completely erased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_244.wav	3.80	His sister added, We expected him to be jailed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_245.wav	4.78	We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_246.wav	2.91	I've been thinking about it for a year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_247.wav	2.11	Scotland were on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_248.wav	2.86	I enjoy playing with both of them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_249.wav	2.09	Too often it is not.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_250.wav	2.29	Alex Ferguson is the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_251.wav	2.69	I tend not to look back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_252.wav	2.86	Confidence among the allies began to slip.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_253.wav	3.54	The real problem is the Usher Hall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_254.wav	4.40	My family, health and golf is always a balancing act.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_255.wav	2.22	I got a yellow card.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_256.wav	3.03	My game just seems to keep on improving.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_257.wav	3.88	We would expect it to disappear in time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_258.wav	3.72	Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_259.wav	4.10	I'd love to have been on the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_260.wav	3.12	I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_261.wav	2.82	I didn't know what he was capable of.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_262.wav	2.66	Our place as artists is to ask questions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_263.wav	2.90	I ran to get out of the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_264.wav	3.46	She's now on the back benches.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_265.wav	2.65	But there are some problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_266.wav	3.41	It may also be her last.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_267.wav	4.65	It should not lose out in any way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_268.wav	3.55	We're very pleased about the verdict.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_269.wav	4.10	It will not be a long campaign.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_270.wav	3.67	Subs not used, McGraw.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_271.wav	2.60	Maybe it helps us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_272.wav	2.77	Three bystanders were killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_273.wav	4.18	We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_274.wav	4.10	However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_275.wav	3.42	Was it just negligent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_276.wav	2.56	He made no big mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_277.wav	2.78	It will not be today, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_278.wav	2.31	Which is a shame.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_279.wav	3.37	That is where our future lies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_280.wav	4.78	There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_281.wav	3.42	Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_282.wav	2.48	That was enough for the committee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_283.wav	2.22	We will be homeless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_284.wav	4.95	Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_285.wav	3.93	In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_286.wav	3.59	Sure, this is a very important event for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_287.wav	3.46	We have to focus on what is important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_288.wav	2.86	They have to work so hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_289.wav	3.41	But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_290.wav	2.31	Well, was it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_291.wav	2.65	That's my big challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_292.wav	3.33	The problems are a result of that shortfall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_293.wav	3.33	We have to adapt to this level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_294.wav	3.03	So what is it with Nato?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_295.wav	2.39	We won't let you down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_296.wav	3.71	Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_297.wav	2.60	There's a strong involvement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_298.wav	3.08	The observer saw no evidence ofr fighting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_299.wav	4.70	He was visited by UK consular officials.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_300.wav	5.59	So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_301.wav	2.56	English is the language of pop music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_302.wav	3.88	The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_303.wav	3.24	It is a simple equation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_304.wav	2.78	It makes a huge difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_305.wav	3.67	By that time, however, it was already too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_306.wav	4.14	She has seen, or heard, it all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_307.wav	4.12	Which Scot is likely to emulate his achievements?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_308.wav	2.90	Could you put it in writing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_309.wav	2.61	They play together perfectly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_310.wav	2.86	We will meet again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_311.wav	4.01	It's a record label, not a form of music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_312.wav	3.59	The other conditions were not specified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_313.wav	3.97	They should use it on the catwalk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_314.wav	4.10	Perhaps it is the Crown Estate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_315.wav	3.50	We're looking at the Citizens Theatre the Lyceum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_316.wav	3.71	It certainly sounded it at times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_317.wav	2.65	Anyone can take a photo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_318.wav	4.35	We were very happy with our results, which were excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_319.wav	4.06	They treated me with respect and courtesy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_320.wav	2.60	He is involved in everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_321.wav	2.56	Family, if you like.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_322.wav	4.01	A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_323.wav	2.78	I don't want to change anything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_324.wav	3.03	I've only met him three times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_325.wav	2.86	You see, my back has gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_326.wav	3.58	It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_327.wav	4.61	Part of Johnny was found some days after.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_328.wav	2.65	We are the weakest link.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_329.wav	2.61	It had been on the cards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_330.wav	2.48	She looked very, very poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_331.wav	2.69	He did, and he missed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_332.wav	3.93	Nato has completed planning for air strikes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_333.wav	2.95	Many innocent people will die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_334.wav	2.26	The mood was defiant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_335.wav	1.71	We have now no choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_336.wav	3.84	I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_337.wav	3.76	Butcher has only one idea in mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_338.wav	2.60	It's our worst nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_339.wav	2.52	We gave them the goal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_340.wav	4.06	Self control is just one instalment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_341.wav	3.29	It would be a massive boost for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_342.wav	2.99	You never had it so good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_343.wav	2.65	Both are national treasures.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_344.wav	4.57	The then secretary was not amused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_345.wav	3.20	I can't speak for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_346.wav	5.21	It is also claimed that he was murdered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_347.wav	4.74	Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_348.wav	3.84	I can't see him reversing that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_349.wav	2.52	He was on a horse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_350.wav	4.10	I'm really looking forward to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_351.wav	3.76	Capital gains tax is also being reduced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_352.wav	4.65	I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_353.wav	3.63	And that gives a kind of freedom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_354.wav	4.35	I have also been delighted with Stevie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_355.wav	3.62	He's on the wrong side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_356.wav	5.81	If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_357.wav	3.50	My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_358.wav	3.63	Labour is providing none of these.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_359.wav	4.65	So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_360.wav	3.93	There is no musical background in his family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_361.wav	4.40	However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_362.wav	4.05	The mix with Tiger is perfect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_363.wav	4.14	There were no immediate reports of injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_364.wav	3.97	Well, it happened to me, so it's happening to him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_366.wav	3.33	Finally action had been taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_367.wav	2.48	We're not travel agents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_368.wav	2.52	It's hard not to.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_369.wav	3.20	Broke down and can't be fixed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_370.wav	3.12	I'm desperate to play in this match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_371.wav	2.86	That's always the case, isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_372.wav	3.29	However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_373.wav	4.01	Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_374.wav	2.39	It is patently true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_375.wav	2.86	They did not threaten anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_376.wav	4.78	There is no hiding place in it, no room for passengers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_377.wav	4.52	That is the position the MoD has adopted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_378.wav	3.93	But sometimes it works out all right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_379.wav	3.59	What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_380.wav	3.93	Even then he was in the media spotlight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_381.wav	2.26	Therein lies the problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_382.wav	2.56	You feel the pride.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_383.wav	3.80	But this is not just a Tibetan issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_384.wav	3.37	The distinction is also supported by doctors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_385.wav	3.33	I have to keep working hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_386.wav	4.74	Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_387.wav	4.14	Art is still a risky investment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_388.wav	3.20	That is difficult to answer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_389.wav	3.29	A century on, little has changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_390.wav	3.80	Wrong decisions Address in full
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_391.wav	2.82	My father had been unwell for many years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_392.wav	3.46	She said she would not welcome the flowers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_393.wav	4.23	It is a temptation which should be resisted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_394.wav	3.33	However, his remarks were heavily qualified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_395.wav	2.78	It was like the old days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_396.wav	2.26	A great deal has been achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_397.wav	2.65	My future is in the marathon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_398.wav	2.69	Then he did it twice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_399.wav	3.37	So is the rest of British sport.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p326\p326_400.wav	3.80	It had until tomorrow to comply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_001.wav	2.82	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_002.wav	4.27	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_003.wav	9.39	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_004.wav	6.58	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_005.wav	7.86	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_006.wav	7.00	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_007.wav	5.63	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_008.wav	9.13	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_009.wav	4.57	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_010.wav	3.55	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_011.wav	8.28	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_012.wav	6.70	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_013.wav	4.48	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_014.wav	6.36	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_015.wav	6.23	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_016.wav	6.96	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_017.wav	4.06	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_018.wav	6.96	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_019.wav	8.75	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_020.wav	4.48	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_021.wav	10.45	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_022.wav	8.36	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_023.wav	13.70	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_024.wav	9.22	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_025.wav	4.31	But there has never been the time, she said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_026.wav	4.91	This could be one such case, he declared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_027.wav	3.03	It's not a solo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_028.wav	5.63	The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_029.wav	3.93	I fell in love with ballet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_030.wav	6.83	That their music is truly, truly, truly great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_031.wav	3.33	I had found my vision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_032.wav	4.35	The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_033.wav	5.08	But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_034.wav	4.49	We don't know the scale of need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_035.wav	5.89	Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_036.wav	4.23	We had a huge response to that campaign.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_037.wav	5.68	Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_038.wav	5.25	I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_039.wav	3.46	We're still talking with a few people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_040.wav	3.59	We know you will not let us down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_041.wav	3.24	He will never walk the streets again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_042.wav	3.46	There are big names.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_043.wav	3.07	That argument has been won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_044.wav	3.67	Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_045.wav	3.12	I hope you will leave it at that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_046.wav	4.18	We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_047.wav	3.08	The bill would be massive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_048.wav	3.80	He was just a journalist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_049.wav	5.21	They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_050.wav	4.78	Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_051.wav	2.39	I didn't have a clue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_052.wav	3.16	How can they engage with the work?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_053.wav	3.37	I have been coming here for nine years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_054.wav	3.12	She has a wonderful mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_055.wav	3.97	There are just two tournaments remaining.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_056.wav	3.08	We're into that build-up now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_057.wav	3.50	It is the end of an era.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_058.wav	3.54	I have had no social life at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_059.wav	3.80	Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_060.wav	3.20	In short, the club was broke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_061.wav	3.41	His charisma is all on the course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_062.wav	3.84	I am still pretty young in this business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_063.wav	3.50	On Saturday, it was much the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_064.wav	3.03	We're not the tourist board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_065.wav	2.69	It was the same old story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_066.wav	3.76	Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_067.wav	4.18	The Commons is too outdated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_068.wav	5.64	You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_069.wav	4.01	What happens when the funding is exhausted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_070.wav	4.44	It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_071.wav	3.72	Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_072.wav	4.57	Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_073.wav	3.42	He would be with his peers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_074.wav	3.76	They seem to be backing off from that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_075.wav	3.93	This will be no easy option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_076.wav	4.35	I wish they, too, would get a grip.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_077.wav	3.71	I am so sorry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_078.wav	4.87	This avalanche is just beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_079.wav	4.19	It is a pity, but you can't have everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_080.wav	4.87	We will see how he is after treatment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_081.wav	4.10	I was there for five hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_082.wav	3.97	But then he changed his mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_083.wav	4.61	I don't know why she is not here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_084.wav	4.74	They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_085.wav	3.12	There are no excuses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_086.wav	3.33	I feel very strongly about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_087.wav	3.08	It is a difficult thing to explain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_088.wav	2.52	He just wants to play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_089.wav	3.67	It's very difficult and very worrying.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_090.wav	4.06	Slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_091.wav	4.10	I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_092.wav	4.48	His treatment has been quite atrocious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_093.wav	3.46	I want to play at the highest level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_094.wav	3.80	Nothing like this has ever happened here before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_095.wav	3.97	It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_096.wav	3.54	Jamming would be equally difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_097.wav	3.46	Drugs are always an issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_098.wav	3.80	Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_099.wav	5.33	This kind of problem arises everywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_100.wav	5.47	There are lots of these women in Finland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_101.wav	3.50	Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_102.wav	3.89	There is no guarantee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_103.wav	3.67	We make good weapons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_104.wav	3.12	I'm confident we can turn things around.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_105.wav	4.70	He lost his job, but it was not just a job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_106.wav	4.53	The news was yesterday welcomed by union leaders.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_107.wav	4.78	Scottish rugby has given me everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_108.wav	3.80	It may be argued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_109.wav	4.02	He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_110.wav	3.76	I bought a car at auction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_111.wav	3.54	They agree to meet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_112.wav	2.94	They could not hear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_113.wav	4.01	It has been hijacked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_114.wav	4.86	His three-year appointment begins on Monday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_115.wav	6.19	He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_116.wav	3.63	She had been sexually assaulted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_117.wav	4.95	The event has now gone to Helsinki.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_118.wav	4.14	That is different from being impartial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_119.wav	3.58	Both offices were closed yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_120.wav	3.29	They don't have to, but they normally do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_121.wav	6.53	Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_122.wav	4.14	David was not either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_123.wav	3.63	They are so easy for youngsters to open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_124.wav	3.67	He wanted someone young and ambitious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_125.wav	4.65	More patience and composure was required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_126.wav	3.71	That's why the young musicians have joined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_127.wav	2.95	There is no smoking gun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_128.wav	3.42	The trial is set for February.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_129.wav	3.33	I didn't play well last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_130.wav	2.35	It was an ambush.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_131.wav	3.54	Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_132.wav	3.59	Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_133.wav	5.42	If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_134.wav	3.63	Is that too much to ask?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_135.wav	3.59	I have so much respect for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_136.wav	4.06	Each one has its own system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_137.wav	5.25	I felt under no pressure today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_138.wav	3.72	The Devil is the creator of weapons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_139.wav	3.50	And that was the adults.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_140.wav	5.12	Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_141.wav	3.50	That is a job for the Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_142.wav	4.36	And he had much need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_143.wav	4.65	Last night the bombardment was terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_144.wav	4.69	The other children were severely mentally impaired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_145.wav	3.88	This can only help us go forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_146.wav	5.29	That left a bad taste in my mouth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_147.wav	4.14	But, even so, you always want to try something new.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_148.wav	4.70	Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_149.wav	3.41	I hadn't been looking after myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_150.wav	3.89	And really, the songs are the key thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_151.wav	4.91	His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_152.wav	3.20	Perhaps they knew something we didn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_153.wav	4.61	Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_154.wav	3.59	The whole experience has left me bitter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_155.wav	3.41	I guess it is down to focus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_156.wav	5.00	There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_157.wav	3.71	I have great respect for all my players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_158.wav	4.01	His track record is not promising.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_159.wav	5.59	No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_160.wav	3.71	For a moment it was all about her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_161.wav	2.31	It will be a great night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_162.wav	3.63	Sadly, the game will never see his like again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_163.wav	3.29	Trading Places was too obvious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_164.wav	4.19	What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_165.wav	2.82	That's the way it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_166.wav	4.27	We've been calling for a level playing field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_167.wav	3.76	I see the extended family once a year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_168.wav	2.48	I am not a magician.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_169.wav	2.90	We couldn't go very fast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_170.wav	2.69	There was even a joke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_171.wav	3.12	Tony Blair, can you see her face?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_172.wav	3.24	You probably have never seen them before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_173.wav	4.40	They had previously been on five-day notice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_174.wav	3.97	She had experience of the wildest places.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_175.wav	2.99	It is highly unlikely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_176.wav	3.63	The show is small but perfectly formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_177.wav	4.99	That is the first job of the director - leadership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_178.wav	6.06	It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_179.wav	3.25	It is too early to speculate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_180.wav	3.59	I love the moment of being first.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_181.wav	4.70	Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_182.wav	4.27	Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_183.wav	5.68	She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_184.wav	3.16	Or so we have long assumed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_185.wav	3.24	They responded with victories.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_186.wav	4.82	I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_187.wav	3.63	What is the truth about the cow?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_188.wav	3.42	They will want to watch a winning team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_189.wav	2.74	I think it's awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_190.wav	2.73	Who is going to be penalised?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_191.wav	4.61	This will be just another tax on motorists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_192.wav	4.36	River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_193.wav	4.05	It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_194.wav	4.53	The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_195.wav	3.08	It is a scandal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_196.wav	2.86	Nor should there have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_197.wav	3.50	Just see where the blood is coming from.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_198.wav	5.25	Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_199.wav	2.48	I have a theory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_200.wav	2.94	But these were the nights.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_201.wav	3.71	In her opinion, the rich are different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_202.wav	4.48	Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_203.wav	3.59	I am aware that somebody made a threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_204.wav	3.20	He was jailed for five years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_205.wav	4.19	Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_206.wav	2.95	We will not break even.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_207.wav	2.48	We will look into it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_208.wav	4.40	Sentence was deferred for background reports.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_209.wav	4.70	IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_210.wav	3.54	What did they think of her voice?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_211.wav	3.55	But he's not afraid to take risks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_212.wav	3.29	Three years probation is just a joke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_213.wav	2.99	We did not talk about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_214.wav	3.88	However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_215.wav	2.77	The court has not decided.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_216.wav	3.16	We are opening an inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_217.wav	3.42	I get to work with very good people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_218.wav	4.31	A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_219.wav	3.07	We find this very sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_220.wav	3.80	Four people died instantly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_221.wav	5.55	But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_222.wav	4.78	And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_223.wav	3.50	I'm really happy with the way it went.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_224.wav	3.20	It is a step on the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_225.wav	3.59	Her husband had been waiting for her return.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_226.wav	3.76	I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_227.wav	3.46	People tended to stay there for some time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_228.wav	3.59	All businesses continue to trade.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_229.wav	2.82	It's a difficult job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_230.wav	3.93	Several hundred people attended yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_231.wav	3.72	My preference is for the single vaccines.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_232.wav	3.63	This represents a tough game for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_233.wav	3.46	The boy is no longer with us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_234.wav	3.29	I can't wait for the outdoors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_235.wav	3.54	This is my new career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_236.wav	3.29	It really was a masterful innings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_237.wav	3.97	Mary Archer is almost too clever.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_238.wav	3.37	I would urge the Government to think again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_239.wav	3.42	It will be even more difficult tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_240.wav	2.99	They were on holiday in Egypt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_241.wav	3.24	I was happiest with my short game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_242.wav	2.78	I leave tonight for England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_243.wav	3.29	There is no change in our position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_244.wav	2.86	Everything else is a bonus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_245.wav	4.99	We went on to become very successful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_246.wav	3.84	I'm delighted with how he has come through.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_247.wav	3.84	We must learn from the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_248.wav	3.46	We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_249.wav	2.95	We told them in August.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_250.wav	3.63	That could be at least five years away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_251.wav	2.31	That is my role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_252.wav	3.16	I have no comment to make.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_253.wav	3.89	The sense of excitement in Stirling is tangible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_254.wav	4.44	He also presented You Bet!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_255.wav	4.48	I just went a bit too far.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_256.wav	3.03	And how he kept his word.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_257.wav	3.03	This is a wonderful honour for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_258.wav	5.21	In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_259.wav	2.78	He was a crazy man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_260.wav	3.63	Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_261.wav	3.42	That kind of growth is the important thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_262.wav	3.16	I have no argument with Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_263.wav	2.82	And a film maker was born.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_264.wav	3.12	It was also put on the Internet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_265.wav	3.76	The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_266.wav	2.30	I hope he stays.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_267.wav	3.37	He also has a Scottish grandfather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_268.wav	3.07	Now that was a boxing movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_269.wav	3.71	Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_270.wav	2.60	There was a battle there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_271.wav	4.31	I might also completely change the routine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_272.wav	3.07	Today's ruling confirms that fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_273.wav	3.50	It's good news and long overdue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_274.wav	3.46	I'd never heard him in person before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_275.wav	4.65	From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_276.wav	3.55	I saw them not long after it happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_277.wav	2.43	He doesn't do dinner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_278.wav	3.54	He has been campaigning for change for years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_279.wav	3.08	That's a very strong element.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_280.wav	3.80	A formal decision will be announced within months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_281.wav	3.72	I have beaten her a few times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_282.wav	2.99	He was at home with his pals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_283.wav	2.99	We are taking it seriously.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_284.wav	3.50	It was deployed in the Gulf War.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_285.wav	2.95	Maybe this battle has been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_286.wav	3.50	The manager is there to make these decisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_287.wav	4.06	Now, she has completed a family tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_288.wav	5.25	Then followed a bout of flu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_289.wav	4.06	I have worked with him on projects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_290.wav	2.95	We had no part in it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_291.wav	4.14	His father and mother are in film production.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_292.wav	4.10	The methadone programme is completely out of control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_293.wav	3.20	It was nice to get a clean sheet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_294.wav	2.90	The referee had been right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_295.wav	3.03	Our young people are leaving.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_296.wav	2.39	That would have been too easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_297.wav	3.50	She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_298.wav	2.91	This is not a faceless system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_299.wav	4.06	This is a long-term discussion paper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_300.wav	4.14	In all cases computer equipment was seized.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_301.wav	3.25	That is just a load of baloney.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_302.wav	2.90	I'm feeling very pleased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_303.wav	3.50	The damage from the fire was huge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_304.wav	3.07	She had kept the news from him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_305.wav	4.53	Both agreed on the success of the event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_306.wav	3.29	But we'll just keep trying to get results.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_307.wav	3.08	A play is a set of actions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_308.wav	2.91	Clearly, that is important in nursing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_309.wav	3.80	Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_310.wav	3.08	The campaign was raucous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_311.wav	4.35	Seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_312.wav	3.50	But both were involved with other matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_313.wav	5.47	We were in different places, usually in cellars.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_314.wav	4.10	However, in October another partnership was announced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_315.wav	2.82	There is no threat to them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_316.wav	3.38	The time is up for Iraq to comply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_317.wav	3.24	Nelson does not disappoint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_318.wav	3.25	The woman is basically off her head.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_319.wav	4.18	The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_320.wav	4.44	Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_321.wav	3.37	It is high time to act.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_322.wav	4.36	Then we will face the Danish champions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_323.wav	5.72	He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_324.wav	4.06	The South African defended his work ethic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_325.wav	3.55	Pressure of work is no excuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_326.wav	4.18	There was barely a handful of chances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_327.wav	3.93	That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_328.wav	4.10	But when he left, the decision was forced upon us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_329.wav	3.12	I can't believe something like this could happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_330.wav	4.27	Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_331.wav	4.10	As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_332.wav	3.80	However, we have not come to any conclusions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_333.wav	3.67	Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_334.wav	3.25	That is not the way we should operate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_335.wav	3.24	The new work will begin in the autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_336.wav	3.63	Here, again, they were denied a voice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_337.wav	2.52	We have nothing to hide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_338.wav	3.07	It might have been a satanic ritual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_339.wav	2.73	I'll take the blame for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_340.wav	3.59	It is now time for justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_341.wav	2.48	That is no use.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_342.wav	3.67	There is great interest on our island.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_343.wav	3.54	But he is frustrated at every turn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_344.wav	2.86	Our house was very small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_345.wav	4.40	Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_346.wav	3.50	Later they changed their minds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_347.wav	3.93	Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_348.wav	3.20	First is open defiance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_349.wav	3.33	That is absolute nonsense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_350.wav	3.20	I just had so much fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_351.wav	2.43	It was quite rigorous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_352.wav	3.55	It is a decision which has paid off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_353.wav	4.10	He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_354.wav	2.61	Their mind was already made up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_355.wav	3.97	I had some time with Aston Villa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_356.wav	3.33	We do not expect any surplus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_357.wav	3.50	You don't do the same thing with men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_358.wav	3.88	Just don't go looking to be shocked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_359.wav	2.99	Pray that it is so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_360.wav	3.71	No, is the answer to your first question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_361.wav	3.63	There was support from across the board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_362.wav	3.55	There may be some evidence to this effect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_363.wav	4.69	It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_364.wav	4.82	We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_365.wav	4.78	We have been preparing all year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_366.wav	3.97	The position on the euro remains unchanged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_367.wav	3.03	So what does one do?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_368.wav	4.19	Such actions are rarely popular.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_369.wav	3.84	News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_370.wav	3.16	Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_371.wav	2.30	I joined a group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_372.wav	4.14	The Foreign Office was conspicuous by its absence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_373.wav	3.76	They probably expected something special from me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_374.wav	3.12	But we could not change his mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_375.wav	3.12	We have a team to reach the final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_376.wav	5.68	However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_377.wav	3.76	The written judgment was issued in printed form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_378.wav	3.33	I see no reason for them to be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_379.wav	5.04	Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_380.wav	2.31	I never agreed with that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_381.wav	3.67	Have you heard anything from Paramount?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_382.wav	3.46	He was dead on arrival at the hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_383.wav	4.14	He added, however, that all options are under review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_384.wav	2.69	It is a dilemma.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_385.wav	3.33	We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_386.wav	3.29	They keep the atmosphere in mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_387.wav	3.63	There is no dispute with the Iraqi people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_388.wav	2.69	They did not interfere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_389.wav	3.80	Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_390.wav	3.59	It is a catalogue of obstruction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_391.wav	2.86	I'm happy to contribute to that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_392.wav	4.44	Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_393.wav	3.33	My father died in childbirth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_394.wav	3.33	As if he were a High Court judge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_395.wav	3.12	And that started me thinking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_396.wav	3.59	Offered the gold medal, he declined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_397.wav	4.53	It brings together two essential elements.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_398.wav	3.33	The issue has still to be resolved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_399.wav	3.80	He is a joy to watch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_400.wav	3.29	We have high hopes that this will work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_401.wav	2.43	We are now open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_402.wav	3.20	People ask about the concept of a team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_403.wav	2.52	Who has he fought?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_404.wav	3.76	The film is about the cost of genius.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_405.wav	2.86	They've been here before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_406.wav	2.77	I want a free vote.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_407.wav	4.02	He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_408.wav	4.23	It would show them a positive way forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_409.wav	3.67	Players were held in equally low regard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_410.wav	3.93	He also admitted possessing a firearm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_411.wav	4.27	ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_412.wav	4.31	Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_413.wav	3.03	They have the cash to do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_414.wav	3.33	He was not seeking special advantage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_415.wav	3.08	There was a fine line to tread.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_416.wav	3.63	Yet it is all for two good causes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_417.wav	3.42	It is so elusive and light.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_418.wav	3.24	Or was it Some kind of a ham?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_419.wav	5.12	We've come from a long way back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_420.wav	5.33	I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_421.wav	3.33	I'll never think of myself as a star.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_422.wav	2.86	The country is in a state of chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_423.wav	2.60	What will happen if it all goes wrong?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p329\p329_424.wav	4.61	In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_001.wav	2.86	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_002.wav	4.23	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_003.wav	8.15	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_004.wav	6.92	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_005.wav	7.38	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_006.wav	7.21	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_007.wav	5.72	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_008.wav	9.17	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_009.wav	5.89	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_010.wav	4.27	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_011.wav	8.32	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_012.wav	6.36	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_013.wav	5.59	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_014.wav	6.02	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_015.wav	7.00	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_016.wav	7.30	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_017.wav	4.52	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_018.wav	6.40	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_019.wav	8.45	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_020.wav	5.38	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_021.wav	11.52	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_022.wav	8.28	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_023.wav	12.80	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_024.wav	7.81	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_025.wav	4.06	Like anyone else, he has to take his time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_026.wav	3.16	I was backing him up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_027.wav	4.44	It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_028.wav	4.14	Surely history will not repeat itself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_029.wav	3.07	That was their attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_030.wav	3.29	It was nothing to do with my daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_031.wav	4.48	The problem in Norway is outside the National.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_032.wav	4.52	Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_033.wav	5.85	And it had two seats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_034.wav	3.67	They could move in at any moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_035.wav	4.10	There were no reported injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_036.wav	5.21	I haven't spoken to anyone about that, not even my wife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_037.wav	6.45	Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_038.wav	3.63	It is my nature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_039.wav	3.84	Or so she thought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_040.wav	5.47	Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_041.wav	4.19	This advice was accepted by ministers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_042.wav	3.71	We did not even get a free kick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_043.wav	5.68	What was going through her mind that day, that night?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_044.wav	4.02	Our decision making was poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_045.wav	4.49	Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_046.wav	3.80	They said we were out of touch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_047.wav	4.57	In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_048.wav	4.06	It is bad news for the flooded areas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_049.wav	4.44	He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_050.wav	4.78	There will be widespread support on all sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_051.wav	3.93	This was the classical period of Beethoven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_052.wav	3.71	He has one son and one daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_053.wav	3.72	I was never going to play against Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_054.wav	4.23	Any error of judgment was ruled out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_055.wav	3.42	Scotland had great assets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_056.wav	2.95	We shall not forget him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_057.wav	3.88	And thought we would get away with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_058.wav	3.41	I think they should have more respect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_059.wav	4.31	Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_060.wav	2.90	This is a big club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_061.wav	3.21	I find it rather oppressive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_062.wav	4.23	Many, many people don't know who he is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_063.wav	3.67	Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_064.wav	5.93	One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_065.wav	2.78	We have to expand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_066.wav	3.50	Others may be trying to catch up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_067.wav	2.90	We gave everything we had.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_068.wav	3.54	I think it is a release of tension.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_069.wav	3.07	This is a most serious matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_070.wav	3.80	I let go the telephone and ran.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_071.wav	3.03	It is also very valuable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_072.wav	3.46	We're trying to lessen the stigma.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_073.wav	6.02	Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_074.wav	3.12	This makes up for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_075.wav	3.03	This is purely financial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_076.wav	3.12	I want to help other women.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_077.wav	3.08	The problem is Labour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_078.wav	3.54	The way ahead is not easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_079.wav	2.86	I could do a better job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_080.wav	3.67	I will not be in dialogue with her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_081.wav	4.10	An announcement will follow in due course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_082.wav	2.65	I am here to play football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_083.wav	4.82	Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_084.wav	2.65	That is the crunch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_085.wav	4.14	I did not want any damage to us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_086.wav	3.67	Four minutes later, the show was over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_087.wav	4.31	It was an easy decision to come here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_088.wav	4.40	I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_089.wav	4.31	However, you have just got to adjust to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_090.wav	4.18	Everything has the potential to be serious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_091.wav	4.27	Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_092.wav	4.87	Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_093.wav	3.42	This will be great for the young lads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_094.wav	6.74	He needed seven hours of surgery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_095.wav	5.17	Who said impatience is a virtue?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_096.wav	3.89	What do we do for an encore?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_097.wav	5.68	Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_098.wav	4.23	Many other Scottish locations also feature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_099.wav	2.60	There's nothing for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_100.wav	5.72	Creative, expressive football was the order of the day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_101.wav	4.61	Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_102.wav	2.73	The feeling is marvellous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_103.wav	4.52	An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_104.wav	3.24	It was more like a Labour Party rally.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_105.wav	4.31	The conductor, too, will have adjustments to make.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_106.wav	4.19	In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_107.wav	3.67	I'm astonished the men were not injured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_108.wav	4.57	The partnership was set up during the summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_109.wav	4.10	Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_110.wav	3.50	The money is not really our concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_111.wav	2.86	You just know it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_112.wav	4.27	Wallace was in at the deep end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_113.wav	3.59	Don't say you have not been warned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_114.wav	3.41	Some were close to tears.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_115.wav	4.14	Seven children had lost both parents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_116.wav	4.66	So, how will it be received in the US?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_117.wav	4.78	The government was consulting interested parties, he added.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_118.wav	4.61	Above all, he was knocked out by the choir.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_119.wav	6.10	There will always be someone, somewhere, willing to undercut on price.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_120.wav	5.38	Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_121.wav	4.86	Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_122.wav	5.04	Some people still think she should be English.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_123.wav	5.12	Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_124.wav	3.89	Repayment is not part of the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_125.wav	4.27	Who will perform?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_126.wav	3.58	It's like a high school play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_127.wav	5.12	He was part of South Africa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_128.wav	5.81	It's much more dynamic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_129.wav	4.69	The party will make up its own mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_130.wav	4.27	What do they pay to join the club?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_131.wav	4.05	Two people are allowed to share the duty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_132.wav	3.76	They want to avoid a flashpoint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_133.wav	3.50	We are now in a safe place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_134.wav	4.53	She goes to the opening of an envelope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_135.wav	3.93	The reason, of course, was Iraq.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_136.wav	3.97	It will be very useful for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_137.wav	3.42	He was obviously very genuine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_138.wav	3.12	We told them in July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_139.wav	2.86	It's like a garage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_140.wav	3.58	He will be judged by his actions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_141.wav	3.12	No Briton has ever won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_142.wav	3.12	The answer is with ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_143.wav	3.38	That is the last thing they need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_144.wav	3.03	Was society doing enough?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_145.wav	3.89	The results are sometimes contentious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_146.wav	3.33	I never thought it would take this long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_147.wav	2.60	He changed my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_148.wav	2.99	There was nothing else to match it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_149.wav	4.06	I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_150.wav	4.70	It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_151.wav	2.91	They have worked with each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_152.wav	3.29	O, Is there a lot of blood?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_153.wav	3.55	Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_154.wav	4.86	That will alter the dynamics of Scottish politics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_155.wav	3.93	His parenthood is called into question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_156.wav	4.61	Audacious decisions were taken early on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_157.wav	3.76	But it could have been written for her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_158.wav	3.42	His only reply was a laugh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_159.wav	3.42	I'm really looking forward to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_160.wav	3.76	A report will be issued by March.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_161.wav	5.25	We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_162.wav	3.12	The party lasted all night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_163.wav	3.67	I was delighted with every one of them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_164.wav	4.87	Sure the COE is a cracking band.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_165.wav	5.08	At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_166.wav	3.50	It was horrible, but there is still more.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_167.wav	3.25	I was proud of our lads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_168.wav	6.15	So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_169.wav	4.53	This is not a Scottish problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_170.wav	3.80	It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_171.wav	5.55	There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_172.wav	3.42	After that, we made some changes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_173.wav	4.23	These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_174.wav	4.14	He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_175.wav	3.67	Scotland were beaten again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_176.wav	3.93	Glasgow is a tour de force.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_177.wav	3.20	I have no battle with the Scots.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_178.wav	4.78	The League of Nations was also his idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_179.wav	4.18	I've done it almost like a variety show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_180.wav	4.57	He urged Mr Blair to get out more.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_181.wav	4.19	She is on a life support machine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_182.wav	4.19	The actor has met with Mandela.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_183.wav	5.85	Euro The single currency is a fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_184.wav	3.93	This is a dream come true for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_185.wav	4.74	The election is total confusion and chaos.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_186.wav	3.38	I think it'll be a great occasion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_187.wav	3.42	He went to see what he could learn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_188.wav	4.82	It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_189.wav	4.57	A board of inquiry has already been convened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_190.wav	4.01	We're not an employment agency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_191.wav	3.33	It has all been positive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_192.wav	3.97	Referees are easy targets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_193.wav	4.52	It's not one or the other, you have to have both.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_194.wav	3.63	No government has that right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_195.wav	3.50	The luxury has been well used.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_196.wav	5.34	Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_197.wav	3.07	Billie was yet to be born.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_198.wav	3.84	She died in hospital two hours later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_199.wav	5.08	Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_200.wav	3.50	This is a good result for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_201.wav	3.63	We think all other measures are not exhausted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_202.wav	3.33	There was no time scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_203.wav	3.59	Our message was inclusive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_204.wav	3.85	She was right about the struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_205.wav	3.67	Only the scale of change differed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_206.wav	3.93	That was one very hard game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_207.wav	4.14	I think the euro has slipped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_208.wav	3.71	We began to walk down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_209.wav	4.48	I will not take you out of context.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_210.wav	5.04	Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_211.wav	3.29	The cold war is over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_212.wav	3.67	I'd like to take the plunge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_213.wav	4.35	There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_214.wav	4.53	Lately, that market has come under pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_215.wav	2.90	It had to be more flexible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_216.wav	3.41	We are not far from a deal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_217.wav	3.46	Are there muscular problems?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_218.wav	3.50	You remember how long he lasted?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_219.wav	4.61	Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_220.wav	4.61	Ordering online was very easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_221.wav	3.33	I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_222.wav	4.27	However, Sharon rejected the claims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_223.wav	3.12	I think it is a great idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_224.wav	5.12	After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_225.wav	4.52	But it's just great to have won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_226.wav	4.10	We're going to see more extreme weather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_227.wav	4.10	Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_228.wav	3.50	All these women were actors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_229.wav	2.95	I've got no secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_230.wav	4.99	We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_231.wav	3.54	Craig is still suffering seizures.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_232.wav	3.88	What happened to me last week was wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_233.wav	3.50	I never made any offer to Mark.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_234.wav	4.44	To a level which we consider appropriate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_235.wav	3.25	That is the first thing we need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_236.wav	2.86	Will they ever reopen?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_237.wav	5.00	After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_238.wav	3.16	We have great team spirit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_239.wav	4.06	Above all the aggression must be stopped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_240.wav	4.52	A national strike would be dangerous and damaging.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_241.wav	3.97	We have to concentrate on three points tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_242.wav	3.29	You would fall over, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_243.wav	3.67	We have a lot of sympathy for applicants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_244.wav	3.50	They should take their mobile phones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_245.wav	3.97	He loved his job and working in newspapers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_246.wav	4.40	Mr Finnie, however, said his hands were tied.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_247.wav	3.88	They are also exploited by the markets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_248.wav	3.80	The principle is quite clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_249.wav	4.06	Talks will then resume again in the autumn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_250.wav	4.27	The board of governors must act.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_251.wav	3.25	We must all play our part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_252.wav	2.82	I first met him last summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_253.wav	3.76	It was to be published next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_254.wav	3.59	That is a break with tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_255.wav	4.23	Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_256.wav	4.01	It could have been a hammering by now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_257.wav	4.61	Last night, the centre issued a statement to the contrary.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_258.wav	3.80	Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_259.wav	3.88	Subs not used, Fernandez.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_260.wav	3.88	The question is, Is that a negative?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_261.wav	4.95	This would discourage investment and job creation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_262.wav	4.10	I played really well on the back nine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_263.wav	4.14	Last week, he was taken into hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_264.wav	2.82	He will decide tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_265.wav	4.05	It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_266.wav	4.91	Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_267.wav	5.08	That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_268.wav	4.74	But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_269.wav	6.27	Mary is, as it were, the cause of her mother's death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_270.wav	3.20	That is our main aim.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_271.wav	5.64	For this government, reform and resources go together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_272.wav	3.84	I always knew she was funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_273.wav	4.99	However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_274.wav	3.16	All kinds of things occur.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_275.wav	3.41	Mentally, you have to be tough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_276.wav	3.54	I expected these kind of questions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_277.wav	4.36	The film has also been superbly designed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_278.wav	3.20	It was fit for royalty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_279.wav	3.55	It is always the same, isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_280.wav	4.74	Who would take it now, after all this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_281.wav	3.37	I felt really good until Friday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_282.wav	5.12	Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_283.wav	3.67	I am confident of the outcome this week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_284.wav	3.50	Equity declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_285.wav	3.37	There is precious little middle ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_286.wav	3.84	She was shouting my baby, my baby.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_287.wav	4.70	He later became a respected High Court judge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_288.wav	3.67	They were both delightful to work with.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_289.wav	3.84	It's my delight on a shiny night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_290.wav	4.61	If convicted, they face the death penalty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_291.wav	4.01	It's now down in black and white.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_292.wav	3.89	Twaddle is a case in point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_293.wav	3.76	Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_294.wav	3.46	Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_295.wav	3.50	There were no formal announcements.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_296.wav	4.31	For now, we must take one game at a time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_297.wav	3.42	That was quite an interesting part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_298.wav	4.27	Breaking new ground is also very rewarding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_299.wav	4.06	Motion described it as a unique event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_300.wav	3.29	We have to offer value for money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_301.wav	3.59	The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_302.wav	3.03	Chris is big and jolly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_303.wav	2.86	It is quite an eye opener.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_304.wav	3.38	It became a national network.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_305.wav	3.93	They still have the dirty work to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_306.wav	3.63	I do not want to wait until May.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_307.wav	5.08	The festival idea has been a great success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_308.wav	4.40	We really need research to help with that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_309.wav	3.08	We all work for nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_310.wav	4.06	It is extremely popular with families.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_311.wav	3.54	He will do very well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_312.wav	3.41	It was a cry for help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_313.wav	3.67	They also intend to travel today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_314.wav	3.20	There's a lot of hysteria.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_315.wav	3.84	The casualties were not named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_316.wav	5.12	For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_317.wav	4.52	Axis itself was created from that exercise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_318.wav	4.35	Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_319.wav	4.78	It's just that we see different things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_320.wav	4.23	Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_321.wav	3.25	I am very happy with life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_322.wav	3.76	We are all family men with children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_323.wav	4.19	The committee's remit is far reaching.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_324.wav	4.19	We've had our problems at the club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_325.wav	4.23	The plot is changing as time goes on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_326.wav	3.72	They were at her bedside when she died.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_327.wav	4.44	I think we showed that after half time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_328.wav	5.12	Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_329.wav	2.86	I am not in denial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_330.wav	3.84	There is a solution, she believes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_331.wav	3.16	Yet the data is compelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_332.wav	4.48	Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_333.wav	3.93	There was pressure from elsewhere too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_334.wav	3.46	What are you waiting for?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_335.wav	3.55	It could have been just a quick fix.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_336.wav	3.46	Will he be given time?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_337.wav	4.01	You let a lot of people down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_338.wav	3.72	It's annoying in a way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_339.wav	3.72	The result today is an impasse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_340.wav	3.29	It would have to be backdated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_341.wav	4.23	One person was believed to have been hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_342.wav	3.76	It is like being a qualifier again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_343.wav	3.88	And he's the first to see that, and say that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_344.wav	4.18	Our biggest threat is the BBC.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_345.wav	4.61	Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_346.wav	2.82	She is very upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_347.wav	3.71	We have to learn lessons from these things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_348.wav	4.57	It was a poor performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_349.wav	4.74	We are very very proud of Alain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_350.wav	4.23	That is the consistent approach of the Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_351.wav	4.01	There was no sign that anything was amiss.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_352.wav	3.89	It didn't help him, as far as we had seen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_353.wav	4.14	Head injuries are the leading cause of death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_354.wav	3.58	It is patently true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_355.wav	3.89	I've got my own ideas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_356.wav	3.50	The guys have really enjoyed it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_357.wav	2.95	They might want to play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_358.wav	3.37	The goal will stay with me forever.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_359.wav	3.46	Our people should be immune.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_360.wav	3.50	It is simple and easy to use.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_361.wav	4.48	Today's agreement will help tackle that problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_362.wav	5.51	English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_363.wav	3.08	It is the way they work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_364.wav	3.24	This was another video cassette.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_365.wav	3.67	The rear of the plane was on fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_366.wav	4.53	It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_367.wav	2.82	I think we finished fifth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_368.wav	5.98	Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_369.wav	3.72	We know them as mobile telephones.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_370.wav	3.80	I have chosen to do this research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_371.wav	2.82	That's the law of the land.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_372.wav	5.55	For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_373.wav	2.78	He scored a touchdown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_374.wav	2.56	He wouldn't do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_375.wav	3.12	I don't know exactly what happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_376.wav	5.25	They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_377.wav	3.37	We are waiting for them to calm down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_378.wav	3.59	The Government faces a moral dilemma.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_379.wav	4.31	And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_380.wav	3.42	Debate is not just talk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_381.wav	4.44	However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_382.wav	3.80	Neither was involved in violence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_383.wav	4.74	But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_384.wav	3.93	So people will come out with these things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_385.wav	3.85	It was a very difficult decision for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_386.wav	2.99	I am not a happy man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_387.wav	3.20	Was it just negligent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_388.wav	3.29	That would open the gates of hell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_389.wav	2.82	If only we had known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_390.wav	3.25	The line-up is a tasty one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_391.wav	4.10	He was located after going to Singapore.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_392.wav	3.08	She was my big sister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_393.wav	4.61	Meantime, his appointment has been widely welcomed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_394.wav	3.07	They will now get that support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_395.wav	4.35	Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_396.wav	3.16	Then  all was revealed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_397.wav	3.88	They are interior designers and architects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_398.wav	3.89	Suspension will come into force at midnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_399.wav	4.31	However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_400.wav	3.84	All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_401.wav	5.38	WHAT's in a name in this, the age of the Internet?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_402.wav	3.50	We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_403.wav	4.31	They had given up on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_404.wav	3.93	She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_405.wav	3.50	We didn't know if people would turn up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_406.wav	3.12	We will deal with the refugees.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_407.wav	3.08	I am greatly encouraged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_408.wav	3.25	They offer a kind of narrative.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_409.wav	3.20	You guys are not out of it yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_410.wav	3.20	What does he want him to look like?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_411.wav	4.35	You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_412.wav	2.52	What is next?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_413.wav	3.25	Their welfare is very important to us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_414.wav	3.12	It's nothing to do with me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_415.wav	8.62	She has now been registered as disabled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_416.wav	3.29	You have to work with what you've got.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_417.wav	4.53	O Leary now intends to take a holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_418.wav	4.61	Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_419.wav	3.54	This is about the Orange Order.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_420.wav	3.72	But it looks good for next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_421.wav	2.60	We will do so again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_422.wav	3.50	It's been a long, long journey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_423.wav	3.03	I have no problem with that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p330\p330_424.wav	2.39	The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_001.wav	2.30	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_002.wav	4.14	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_003.wav	6.62	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_004.wav	4.36	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_005.wav	6.62	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_006.wav	6.70	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_007.wav	4.65	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_008.wav	7.22	These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_009.wav	4.23	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_010.wav	2.69	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_011.wav	6.32	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_012.wav	4.66	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_013.wav	4.01	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_014.wav	5.04	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_015.wav	5.51	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_016.wav	5.85	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_017.wav	3.42	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_018.wav	5.21	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_019.wav	6.66	Since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_020.wav	3.37	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_021.wav	8.41	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_022.wav	6.36	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_023.wav	9.99	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_024.wav	6.57	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_025.wav	3.12	He needed seven hours of surgery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_026.wav	3.63	In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_027.wav	2.86	But who shot the president?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_028.wav	3.54	Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_030.wav	2.43	All would be under threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_031.wav	3.25	Some will be deployed on submarines.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_032.wav	2.43	There are moments of silence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_033.wav	4.23	So now this series has had its day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_034.wav	2.90	Gaelic provision continued to be good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_035.wav	2.82	Bobby Robson called him a genius.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_036.wav	2.95	It's a policy which has worked for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_037.wav	3.38	They were urged to get themselves in order.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_038.wav	3.76	Too many factors are now working against him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_039.wav	2.69	His views are hardly surprising.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_040.wav	2.18	It is time for a new approach.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_041.wav	2.39	We have nothing to say about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_042.wav	2.39	We've tried every other way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_043.wav	3.72	Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_044.wav	2.39	Nobody else was with me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_045.wav	2.56	However, the report was incorrect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_046.wav	2.65	It does make a big difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_047.wav	2.35	Do not forget about Monaco.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_048.wav	2.99	Peter, of course, refuses to conform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_049.wav	2.39	You can't give in to the vandals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_050.wav	2.52	Everything was an effort.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_051.wav	2.05	And does it even matter?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_052.wav	2.22	This is the same old story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_053.wav	2.78	George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_054.wav	2.22	My parents are exhausted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_055.wav	3.38	No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_056.wav	2.39	The performance was excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_057.wav	2.95	Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_058.wav	3.33	The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_059.wav	1.93	It will come up here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_060.wav	3.20	From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_061.wav	2.99	Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_062.wav	2.35	The chief constable is right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_063.wav	2.18	I didn't expect to get one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_064.wav	2.99	It has been blown out of all proportion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_065.wav	3.16	This is only the start of my season.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_066.wav	2.65	It sounded awfully like panic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_067.wav	2.52	I've taken to the hills.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_068.wav	2.56	John was a very nice man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_069.wav	2.52	This is a big, big win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_070.wav	2.31	The crowd was awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_071.wav	2.73	Every game against New Zealand is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_072.wav	2.90	The jury is still out on this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_073.wav	2.69	My game is in pretty good shape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_074.wav	2.39	That would have killed the match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_075.wav	3.16	Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_076.wav	2.82	I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_077.wav	1.97	They had not been handcuffed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_078.wav	2.82	I think we will join the single currency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_079.wav	2.48	Then it was the turn of the carnival.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_080.wav	2.69	But the tragedy did not stop there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_081.wav	2.48	They wanted to show what they could do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_082.wav	2.52	It runs until the beginning of June.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_083.wav	1.67	All of us do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_084.wav	2.05	But will they fall in love?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_085.wav	2.22	It was different from our other work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_086.wav	2.78	That is in the public domain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_087.wav	2.65	The Hague is too good for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_088.wav	2.99	On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_089.wav	3.88	In just a fortnight, however, everything has changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_090.wav	2.01	It's a true story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_091.wav	2.35	We are looking for volunteers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_092.wav	4.06	John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_093.wav	3.07	It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_094.wav	2.52	Subs not used, McCulloch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_095.wav	3.16	Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_096.wav	2.09	He could face a jail sentence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_097.wav	2.48	They didn't take you to mass graves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_098.wav	1.58	There was no option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_099.wav	3.93	Life is about people, and how you feel about people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_100.wav	2.21	Could they perhaps be related?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_101.wav	2.70	Happily we found it in the library.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_102.wav	3.12	We all thought we were going to die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_103.wav	2.01	Maybe he will act again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_104.wav	2.35	Safety was also an issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_105.wav	2.01	That's why he visited.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_106.wav	2.35	I know a lot of people who don't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_107.wav	2.22	There was nobody on the roof.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_108.wav	2.65	Clark is back on top form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_109.wav	3.63	He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_110.wav	2.27	It needs somebody to give way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_111.wav	2.91	We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_112.wav	3.12	It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_113.wav	2.26	I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_114.wav	2.82	The days of empty promises are over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_115.wav	2.01	I thought he was terrific.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_116.wav	2.31	Henry was strong and talented.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_117.wav	2.60	That left a bad taste in my mouth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_118.wav	2.73	I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_119.wav	3.12	We must improve our relations with government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_120.wav	3.07	Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_121.wav	3.07	This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_122.wav	2.05	A venue was found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_123.wav	4.14	Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_124.wav	2.90	He said it was the worst possible result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_125.wav	3.03	Whatever he does, however, it will be decisive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_126.wav	2.39	This is our way to make our point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_127.wav	2.01	It was a disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_128.wav	3.50	It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_129.wav	2.39	He was back to square one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_130.wav	2.90	Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_131.wav	2.48	I have been coming here for nine years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_132.wav	2.82	It is just part of modern day life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_133.wav	2.65	A young Briton had a lucky escape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_134.wav	3.12	Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_135.wav	3.12	Treatment is not an issue with these people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_136.wav	2.48	YOU thought it was a headache.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_137.wav	3.29	All the people thought that he would die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_138.wav	2.69	It is never an easy game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_139.wav	2.65	This year it will be Billy Crystal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_140.wav	3.80	No-one else is like Michael Jackson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_141.wav	2.28	The post will run for four years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_142.wav	2.56	However, it's good to turn the page.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_143.wav	2.35	He had reason to be pleased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_144.wav	2.16	It was important to win the singles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_145.wav	2.77	That is impressive by any standards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_146.wav	2.65	There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_147.wav	2.48	I'm thinking, what would be easier?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_148.wav	2.18	That alibi is now gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_149.wav	2.86	We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_150.wav	1.92	The Scots are great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_151.wav	3.76	He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_152.wav	3.03	However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_153.wav	2.48	I will certainly be having words with him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_154.wav	2.78	She is a valuable member of the Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_155.wav	3.16	I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_156.wav	2.65	Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_157.wav	1.97	But he is not using them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_158.wav	2.65	Christians in Pakistan are terrified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_159.wav	2.48	I cannot believe she has been admonished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_160.wav	1.84	We are not moving in.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_161.wav	2.22	It was a breathtaking moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_162.wav	2.94	That's been our position all along.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_163.wav	2.27	I was in jail for five years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_164.wav	2.01	There are no charges.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_165.wav	2.90	His funeral is not expected until next week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_166.wav	2.74	Its effect on humans is not yet known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_167.wav	2.48	I am very, very happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_168.wav	2.13	They got the job done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_169.wav	2.31	They tried to give her advice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_170.wav	2.61	They won the trophy in the Hoops.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_171.wav	3.50	It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_172.wav	2.05	It's going to be epic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_173.wav	3.80	Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_174.wav	2.48	It was large enough to fit the wall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_175.wav	2.22	He just carried on filming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_176.wav	2.43	He will be judged by his actions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_177.wav	2.13	I never found my rhythm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_178.wav	1.92	I didn't mean to kill her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_179.wav	2.52	It is a job creation scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_180.wav	3.29	In less than two months, the women have achieved a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_181.wav	2.09	We might be back next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_182.wav	2.22	It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_183.wav	2.26	The same goes for personnel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_184.wav	1.93	In a way he was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_185.wav	2.48	This area is perfect for children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_186.wav	1.71	No, they have not.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_187.wav	3.07	The feeling between the two men was mutual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_188.wav	3.37	That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_189.wav	2.14	I was chosen to do this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_190.wav	2.86	The weekly average was three hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_191.wav	2.82	When he took over it really took off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_192.wav	2.30	I have been very nervous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_193.wav	3.03	The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_194.wav	2.65	There was an element of jealousy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_195.wav	2.14	There was no happy ending.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_196.wav	3.12	Craig is still suffering seizures.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_197.wav	2.30	I didn't play well last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_198.wav	3.07	Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_199.wav	2.95	That certainly brought me back down to earth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_200.wav	1.92	Now it has been eclipsed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_201.wav	3.72	Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_202.wav	2.82	We have no idea what caused the derailment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_203.wav	3.12	Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_204.wav	2.18	It is legally binding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_205.wav	2.56	It has come as a bombshell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_206.wav	2.91	Before the games it was pretty open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_207.wav	2.35	We didn't know he was even out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_208.wav	2.90	He is only now regaining his confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_209.wav	2.56	Singing has gone out of fashion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_210.wav	3.03	Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_211.wav	2.18	They must be kept on the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_212.wav	1.75	We still don't know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_213.wav	2.69	Police have appealed for witnesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_215.wav	2.56	This is a foolish idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_216.wav	2.69	It separates the men from the boys.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_217.wav	2.73	I've invented a village in East Lothian.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_218.wav	2.39	Or some thought that they have.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_219.wav	2.18	If only we had known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_220.wav	3.12	This process of attrition is expected to continue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_221.wav	3.46	A Treasury spokesman derided the Tory charge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_222.wav	2.69	You'll get on like a house on fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_223.wav	2.48	Two and a half million people have died.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_224.wav	1.96	It could not be too high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_225.wav	2.22	How many cases have there been?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_226.wav	2.10	I hope they understand that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_227.wav	3.12	Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_228.wav	2.39	But Annika is just amazing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_229.wav	2.43	Our job is to change that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_230.wav	2.52	She will also get a pay rise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_231.wav	3.72	It's because they can't understand the language.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_232.wav	2.44	It is time for a more honest approach.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_233.wav	3.33	That is very, very bad news for our nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_234.wav	3.59	Nobody can change it overnight, but you can make a start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_235.wav	1.71	What's it all about?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_236.wav	1.92	It is a big time for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_237.wav	2.61	There were two things going on at once.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_238.wav	2.52	It's something we want to make work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_239.wav	2.52	I want to play at the highest level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_240.wav	1.92	We are all equal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_241.wav	2.26	That is the key message.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_242.wav	1.97	It ignores the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_243.wav	1.80	This is the subway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_244.wav	2.61	Altman has every right to be bitter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_245.wav	2.61	It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_246.wav	2.65	We were hopeful that it would be successful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_247.wav	2.86	Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_248.wav	2.61	It is a weakness, and not the only one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_249.wav	2.09	He's in with the furniture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_250.wav	2.52	There are two games to go after that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_251.wav	3.42	However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_252.wav	2.26	Who will provide the wine?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_253.wav	2.22	We are still getting signals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_254.wav	3.50	What's it got to do with them, anyway?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_255.wav	2.78	But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_256.wav	2.27	We started from scratch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_257.wav	2.73	Nothing is being offered in exchange.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_258.wav	2.10	There are a few changes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_259.wav	2.48	You're not going to get hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_260.wav	2.65	THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_261.wav	2.95	The New Deal will constantly be improved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_262.wav	2.86	THE headless man has finally developed a face.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_263.wav	2.39	I heard some of his remarks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_264.wav	2.69	Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_265.wav	1.88	It has to be funded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_266.wav	2.73	Mary Archer is almost too clever.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_267.wav	2.39	I was just overwhelmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_268.wav	2.65	It had been in place since last July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_269.wav	2.65	It was very frightened and dirty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_270.wav	2.31	Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_271.wav	3.16	I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_272.wav	2.22	That's a very strong element.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_273.wav	2.39	How much of a cop out is that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_274.wav	2.22	The whole region is in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_275.wav	2.48	It was a journey into a new life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_276.wav	2.52	It's a way of making a mark.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_277.wav	3.29	Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_278.wav	2.22	You were the kidnappers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_279.wav	2.44	It is a very interesting subject.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_280.wav	1.92	We know we can't rely on you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_281.wav	2.60	Arguably, they have already done it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_282.wav	2.48	It was indeed a night to remember.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_283.wav	3.03	It doesn't appear to be anything too serious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_284.wav	2.05	There is something in this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_285.wav	2.78	I could feel the blood on my face.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_286.wav	2.39	That's why he plays for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_287.wav	2.65	There are no plans to change this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_288.wav	2.35	It's too big a risk to take.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_289.wav	2.69	It's going to be quite a challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_290.wav	2.48	I have heard the stories from Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_291.wav	2.43	It is just too long since the war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_292.wav	2.90	My wife is totally behind me on this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_293.wav	2.18	Debbie Harry was cool.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_294.wav	3.42	Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_295.wav	3.84	We are the British National Party, not the English National Party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_296.wav	1.97	That sort of thing is long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_297.wav	2.18	And sooner than we may think.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_298.wav	1.97	Raised the way you want it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_299.wav	2.86	However, consumers may take a different view.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_300.wav	2.31	I know you went back this morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_301.wav	1.84	I will carry on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_302.wav	3.03	A review of the decision is being sought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_303.wav	1.75	I made a mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_304.wav	2.14	It is a very special city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_305.wav	3.93	A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_306.wav	2.35	They certainly do not socialise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_307.wav	2.39	It's my favourite place to hang out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_308.wav	3.42	I think that could work to our advantage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_309.wav	2.05	Was that not awful?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_310.wav	2.44	That was him under pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_311.wav	3.46	Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_312.wav	2.86	He will make an excellent chief inspector.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_313.wav	2.43	I'm not blaming audiences.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_315.wav	2.90	The Government has to grasp the nettle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_316.wav	3.97	Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_317.wav	3.59	I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_318.wav	3.16	However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_319.wav	2.69	I was doing well at the hustings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_320.wav	2.52	We will just get on with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_321.wav	2.56	We are worried about casualties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_322.wav	1.88	This is my music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_323.wav	2.94	I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_324.wav	2.05	I haven't won the world title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_325.wav	2.95	After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_326.wav	2.35	It's fantastic to have finally won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_327.wav	2.99	But she's also beautiful behind the face.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_328.wav	1.88	And now he tells us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_329.wav	2.73	I am not changing my event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_330.wav	2.48	Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_331.wav	2.56	This Patton will also return.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_332.wav	1.92	That is as it may be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_333.wav	3.29	They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_334.wav	2.60	He came in an army uniform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_335.wav	2.44	Eleven events are required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_336.wav	3.07	It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_337.wav	2.65	You encourage them - you can do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_338.wav	2.90	The winner will be announced by early summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_339.wav	1.92	I always said No.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_340.wav	1.97	The stadium was full.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_341.wav	2.78	Cinema is a communal experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_342.wav	3.16	So, how will it be received in the US?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_343.wav	2.48	He was different from the rest of us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_344.wav	2.14	His name is Michael Owen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_345.wav	2.78	He's got a great chance of making it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_346.wav	2.73	Tartan Day is not a Scottish event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_347.wav	3.29	For now, we must take one game at a time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_348.wav	1.62	So now you know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_349.wav	3.29	But, at the same time, they made you think about life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_350.wav	2.60	I didn't want to ignore the punters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_351.wav	2.69	I foolishly had done nothing about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_352.wav	1.79	The feeling is awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_353.wav	3.54	By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_354.wav	2.22	Smith has not let him down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_355.wav	2.44	We have obviously got some work to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_356.wav	1.80	Which he can do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_357.wav	3.50	No, it's actually in a block of flats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_358.wav	2.86	It has been recorded twice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_359.wav	2.65	They were that poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_360.wav	2.14	And we're talking Big Money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_361.wav	2.73	His silence on the issue is interesting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_362.wav	1.84	They have two children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_363.wav	2.65	With Pierre, you can never be sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_364.wav	2.48	Here is a tale of devotion to duty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_365.wav	2.52	I'm really proud of my young players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_366.wav	2.31	People buy everything with cash.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_367.wav	2.65	There was a great support all round the route.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_368.wav	2.82	They should feel ashamed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_369.wav	2.48	I felt we had fallen back a little.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_370.wav	3.54	Both managements are very supportive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_371.wav	3.54	In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_372.wav	2.01	I'll go out and be aggressive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_373.wav	2.56	This is important for two reasons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_374.wav	2.52	I'm just looking to take my chances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_375.wav	3.84	Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_376.wav	2.18	You will not feel a thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_377.wav	3.37	It's been like that for ages, according to the guys.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_378.wav	2.90	It's not just for classical music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_379.wav	2.48	This must be kept in total perspective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_380.wav	2.61	All of the names are familiar to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_381.wav	2.43	There are moments of honesty, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_382.wav	3.67	Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_383.wav	2.05	Is that where we are?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_384.wav	2.69	We used to keep our business rates.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_385.wav	3.20	It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_386.wav	2.43	But there's no eye contact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_387.wav	2.31	There was no energy behind it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_388.wav	3.84	They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_389.wav	3.67	Have we not had the rainy season already?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_390.wav	2.65	We have chosen for the patients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_391.wav	3.03	They have not allowed them to defend themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_392.wav	2.09	It is not a wish list.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_393.wav	2.78	He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_394.wav	2.22	If not, he should go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_395.wav	2.39	There is no margin for error.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_396.wav	3.07	Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_397.wav	2.35	I get very excited by that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_398.wav	2.44	Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_399.wav	2.27	In the end, it will mean an awful lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_400.wav	1.71	Which means it matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_401.wav	2.48	I think it can count against you now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_402.wav	2.44	There is a great potential on this river.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_403.wav	4.44	This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_404.wav	2.65	She said he showed no remorse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_405.wav	2.27	They hold on for many years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_406.wav	3.38	After New Labour, we now have New Unionists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_407.wav	4.05	However, there are signs of dissent among his collies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_408.wav	2.22	There's nothing for you here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_409.wav	2.69	Home is in the Scottish Borders.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_410.wav	2.82	Officials say the city must achieve this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_411.wav	3.29	It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_412.wav	2.61	I have not come in to take over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_413.wav	1.84	Is this accurate?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_414.wav	2.95	A judicial review is also being considered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_415.wav	2.22	I want to win this thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_416.wav	3.46	Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_417.wav	3.59	The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_418.wav	1.96	I'd just like to play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_419.wav	2.48	They were in good humour, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_420.wav	3.63	It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_421.wav	2.82	Three months or so later, they are returning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_422.wav	3.97	It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_423.wav	2.22	I don't know why you say goodbye.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p333\p333_424.wav	4.23	Appointed general secretary last September.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_001.wav	2.60	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_002.wav	3.71	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_003.wav	6.36	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_004.wav	4.78	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_005.wav	6.66	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_006.wav	5.37	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_007.wav	4.31	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_008.wav	7.68	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_009.wav	4.78	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_010.wav	2.90	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_011.wav	7.34	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_012.wav	4.18	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_013.wav	10.37	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_014.wav	7.13	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_015.wav	4.61	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_016.wav	5.81	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_017.wav	3.16	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_018.wav	4.95	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_019.wav	5.93	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_020.wav	3.97	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_021.wav	8.15	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_022.wav	6.61	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_023.wav	9.56	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_024.wav	6.15	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_025.wav	3.33	A judicial review is also being considered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_026.wav	2.73	I want to win this thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_027.wav	3.29	Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_028.wav	2.22	I'd just like to play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_029.wav	3.59	It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_030.wav	3.25	Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_031.wav	2.39	It was no surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_032.wav	3.55	It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_033.wav	2.69	I don't know why you say goodbye.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_034.wav	3.16	Appointed general secretary last September.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_035.wav	3.46	Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_036.wav	2.44	We could feel the heat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_037.wav	3.16	Darrell was, however, adamant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_038.wav	3.41	He was a member of the Tartan Army.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_039.wav	2.86	I think it can count against you now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_040.wav	2.91	I wanted to win so badly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_041.wav	3.76	It was an accounting error.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_042.wav	2.56	I had enough on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_043.wav	2.77	The offer of help is there for anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_044.wav	2.91	There were no passengers on board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_045.wav	2.27	And we're not there yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_046.wav	2.82	No meaningful response was issued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_047.wav	3.25	And the funny thing is, they usually do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_048.wav	2.99	Times have changed, but have they improved?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_049.wav	3.16	Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_050.wav	2.95	We feel it sends out the wrong message.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_051.wav	2.78	Later we discovered it was a hoax.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_052.wav	3.25	It is a form of physical exercise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_053.wav	2.39	plays in dark blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_054.wav	3.50	But, by that time, of course, it is again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_055.wav	2.78	It is something that we will put right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_056.wav	2.10	Why do it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_057.wav	2.35	It could take three days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_058.wav	2.95	Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_059.wav	2.65	It was totally my fault.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_060.wav	2.39	Or so everyone believed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_061.wav	3.75	It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_062.wav	2.44	Perhaps we should do the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_063.wav	2.73	Tomorrow night is the important game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_064.wav	2.86	He's very good at relating to adults.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_065.wav	3.16	He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_066.wav	3.16	Every aspect of our play was first class.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_067.wav	2.90	Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_068.wav	2.69	It was a move which appealed to him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_069.wav	2.65	There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_070.wav	3.07	He will need that machine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_071.wav	3.50	But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_072.wav	2.82	We are looking for volunteers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_073.wav	2.52	I had a sense of deja vu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_074.wav	3.29	It was very personal and very intimate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_075.wav	3.50	By this point the couple were approaching fast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_076.wav	2.65	I was inspired by two things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_077.wav	2.22	They follow him everywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_078.wav	2.86	I couldn't make out what was going on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_079.wav	2.39	Maybe that was the whole point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_080.wav	2.91	The feeling between the two men was mutual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_081.wav	3.03	They just thought it was extremely good acting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_082.wav	3.29	So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_083.wav	2.95	This must be really short of ideas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_084.wav	2.05	It was extremely cold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_085.wav	2.26	They use them for everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_086.wav	2.18	We have the easy part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_087.wav	3.03	I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_088.wav	3.89	They will pass it on to Jim Wallace, the justice minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_089.wav	2.82	The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_090.wav	2.78	Mr Miller is married with three children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_091.wav	3.67	Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_092.wav	2.95	We already have them, all over Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_093.wav	3.24	There are a lot of unanswered questions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_094.wav	3.03	Libya is an easy target.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_095.wav	3.42	I thought they played very well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_096.wav	3.63	It was a foolhardy decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_097.wav	2.99	It means they actually control the programme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_098.wav	3.21	And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_099.wav	2.94	They chose to side with terror.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_100.wav	2.69	Justice was not seen today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_101.wav	2.65	I would never even consider it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_102.wav	2.99	Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_103.wav	2.26	We should just say no.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_104.wav	3.25	We are not out of touch with politics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_105.wav	2.56	That was a gold medal for certain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_106.wav	3.97	Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_107.wav	2.86	I didn't make those adjustments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_108.wav	2.65	We are satisfied with this outcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_109.wav	2.01	We have it on video.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_110.wav	2.48	Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_111.wav	3.12	There is an element of racism in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_112.wav	2.44	It didn't take long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_113.wav	2.35	This meeting is the path to salvation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_114.wav	3.54	Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_115.wav	2.86	I was very pleased with them today, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_116.wav	2.90	If you're going to do it, do it right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_117.wav	2.39	He told the conference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_118.wav	3.25	The sanctions are about collective punishment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_119.wav	2.60	We tend to come good at the end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_120.wav	2.77	He also received a medal of honour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_121.wav	2.26	It's not one for the purist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_122.wav	3.55	It may now be too expensive for anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_123.wav	3.29	For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_124.wav	3.33	He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_125.wav	3.16	There is bound to be a formal complaint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_126.wav	2.31	It is a time bomb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_127.wav	2.69	It's a matter of huge concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_128.wav	2.86	This could be a recipe for conflict.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_129.wav	2.43	We are taking advice on this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_130.wav	3.25	I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_131.wav	3.63	It was just an accident of birth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_132.wav	4.10	However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_133.wav	2.56	It was a simple question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_134.wav	2.90	Some of his family still live there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_135.wav	3.55	I've no doubt about it, it was actually from her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_136.wav	3.55	By that time, however, it was already too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_137.wav	3.55	Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_138.wav	2.95	Could you put it in writing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_139.wav	2.78	This is the New Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_140.wav	2.73	We all thought we were going to die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_141.wav	2.99	And that's good news for the magpies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_142.wav	3.29	That will come after the game on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_143.wav	2.82	Our offer will remain on the table.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_144.wav	2.73	The world is split into two.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_145.wav	2.73	They deserve a lot of credit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_146.wav	2.65	I would ask the fans to be patient.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_147.wav	2.86	It was so physical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_148.wav	2.95	Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_149.wav	3.80	He always has been, since his early days with the Scottish Opera.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_150.wav	3.29	Why is that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_151.wav	2.26	It is extremely sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_153.wav	3.46	Europe is a hugely contentious issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_154.wav	3.80	It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_155.wav	3.20	And therein lies the whole problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_156.wav	2.56	He was not deterred.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_157.wav	3.12	This commitment should be built upon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_158.wav	3.42	This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_159.wav	3.25	The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_160.wav	3.24	That is not just my personal view.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_161.wav	2.78	The investment will be in the food.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_162.wav	3.46	But he was a full, working member of our staff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_163.wav	2.52	The problem is the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_164.wav	2.52	That's as it should be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_165.wav	2.56	It does seem a mystery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_166.wav	4.06	Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_167.wav	2.31	He looked very sharp.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_168.wav	3.12	The fate of large numbers remains unknown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_169.wav	2.99	Two of the team became ill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_170.wav	2.44	We have taken steps to rectify it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_171.wav	2.82	I see no need for change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_172.wav	3.24	Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_173.wav	3.24	But the Premiership is everything to us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_174.wav	2.43	Do yourselves a favour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_175.wav	3.46	Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_176.wav	2.65	But we have come under attack.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_177.wav	2.99	The new system will be marketed this summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_178.wav	2.78	What do they do, anyway?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_179.wav	3.07	He was just like a godfather to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_180.wav	2.35	I'd love to be like Peter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_181.wav	3.21	I disagree entirely with the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_182.wav	3.42	Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_183.wav	2.82	That is his attitude to things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_184.wav	2.73	Then came the collision with Sergio.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_185.wav	2.99	And what was that like, as an experience?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_186.wav	2.99	Thirteen people will be made redundant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_187.wav	2.82	I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_188.wav	3.33	No finals are to be contested today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_189.wav	2.99	This is not a struggle against Islam.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_190.wav	2.52	That night was a terrible muddle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_191.wav	2.86	His English counterpart agreed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_192.wav	3.12	Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_193.wav	2.43	It is in our own hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_194.wav	2.44	This is a step backwards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_195.wav	2.91	We may make a short-term appointment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_196.wav	2.69	He will address the nation this evening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_197.wav	3.33	Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_198.wav	2.65	I'm not changing my mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_199.wav	3.67	I shall be voting Yes to support him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_200.wav	3.20	We believe that the reason is poverty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_201.wav	2.27	Tony Blair is obviously panicking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_202.wav	2.94	We welcome this increase in the minimum wage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_203.wav	3.33	The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_204.wav	2.65	I'm trying to stay open on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_205.wav	3.29	They serve a multitude of purposes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_206.wav	1.97	We'll have to work hard today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_207.wav	2.61	The frustration was showing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_208.wav	4.06	Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_209.wav	3.33	It is the stop-gap before extinction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_210.wav	3.29	You have obviously got an answer to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_211.wav	2.35	My friends were very envious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_212.wav	3.25	But who cares?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_213.wav	3.20	The house was full of smoke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_214.wav	3.33	The approval system will be changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_215.wav	3.46	So the European elections are extremely important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_216.wav	4.61	Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_217.wav	2.69	That period was a struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_218.wav	2.73	We are determined to establish the facts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_219.wav	2.35	You just have to accept.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_220.wav	3.42	We must improve our relations with government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_221.wav	3.81	This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_222.wav	3.08	The list is too long for this piece.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_223.wav	2.99	If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_224.wav	2.09	I can't blame the fans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_225.wav	2.90	That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_226.wav	3.84	Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_227.wav	3.12	But that attachment took a lot of growing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_228.wav	3.25	This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_229.wav	3.46	However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_230.wav	2.61	So far they have refused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_231.wav	2.82	He is adamant that he is innocent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_232.wav	3.55	To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_233.wav	2.86	The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_234.wav	2.26	He took my breath away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_235.wav	3.76	It's good fun, and makes it so much more interesting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_236.wav	3.12	I will have to order its destruction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_237.wav	2.86	After that it is up to the boss.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_238.wav	2.52	I never wanted a legal battle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_239.wav	3.50	This influence, to the audience, is like an arrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_240.wav	3.46	Downing Street defended the scale of the awards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_241.wav	3.50	It had won an investors in people award.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_242.wav	1.75	A venue was found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_243.wav	2.56	They are not an item.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_244.wav	2.99	Basically, the classical tradition won out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_245.wav	2.01	Is that Titanic?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_246.wav	2.69	He was to get his chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_247.wav	3.67	So, the question is, is it any good?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_248.wav	3.12	I'll always remember the horrible images.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_249.wav	2.90	That's why they go to the opera.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_250.wav	3.46	Well, it's not before time, is it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_251.wav	3.72	They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_252.wav	3.63	The trouble is, though,there is no simple solution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_253.wav	2.99	I'm getting back up there now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_254.wav	2.65	Check that he is dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_255.wav	3.38	I couldn't see any reason not to die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_256.wav	2.95	My players have no idea about football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_257.wav	3.25	They are there to get people into work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_258.wav	3.16	The balance isn't there at EMI.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_259.wav	2.10	I am getting long in the tooth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_260.wav	2.73	They would be wise to do just that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_261.wav	2.48	He was sentenced to seven years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_262.wav	3.16	That, he claimed, was essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_263.wav	2.56	I would like Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_264.wav	3.33	Strathclyde Police yesterday declined to comment on Ferris.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_265.wav	3.20	It felt like my support system was leaving.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_266.wav	3.80	Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_267.wav	2.52	The weaknesses are few.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_268.wav	2.69	I may think about performing it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_269.wav	2.09	I would recommend it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_270.wav	3.03	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_271.wav	4.57	Charles Gordon, leader of the Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_272.wav	2.78	She'd gone to the Catholic school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_273.wav	3.97	Where was their passion, the power and feeling?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_274.wav	3.54	You can't go back and change things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_275.wav	3.46	We are on a four-year mission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_276.wav	2.77	This is a lie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_277.wav	3.50	Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_278.wav	4.14	This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_279.wav	3.71	Its national defence policy is defensive in nature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_280.wav	2.52	They should stop the bombing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_281.wav	2.65	They'll have to pay more.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_282.wav	4.36	Military chiefs were playing it straight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_283.wav	2.09	Does it, Noel?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_284.wav	3.12	Adams is surely worth a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_285.wav	3.50	I will never manage another Scottish club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_286.wav	3.88	The Open champion is back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_287.wav	2.43	It's going to be a new challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_288.wav	3.07	It's the taking part that counts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_289.wav	2.77	They married in August last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_290.wav	2.22	I want to keep him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_291.wav	2.95	We haven't actually considered it down here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_292.wav	2.48	You've been a great audience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_293.wav	2.65	He was telling me to keep quiet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_294.wav	3.59	By then, however, both men were already in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_295.wav	3.07	We were given a warm and friendly reception.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_296.wav	3.67	He also wants to play in this game, and that's important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_297.wav	2.61	We have been extremely lucky this time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_298.wav	2.18	People are fed up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_299.wav	3.46	Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_300.wav	2.73	It's a sign of the times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_301.wav	3.07	But that night they killed her housekeeper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_302.wav	2.35	I just need a bit of luck.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_303.wav	3.33	Once we have done that, the tender will be put out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_304.wav	2.82	Sightings were replaced by rumours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_305.wav	2.18	He is a Satan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_306.wav	2.82	I always felt they played for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_307.wav	3.89	If they don't, they can expect their funding to be cut.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_308.wav	2.65	They must be kept on the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_309.wav	3.42	Again, it's about responding to your resources.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_310.wav	3.89	However, pensions and salaries have yet to be settled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_311.wav	3.46	The whole nation will be delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_312.wav	3.63	The public have been very supportive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_313.wav	4.57	We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_314.wav	4.57	No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_315.wav	3.08	The hotel was now for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_316.wav	3.29	There are two games to go after that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_317.wav	2.52	It seems a little short to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_318.wav	4.01	Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_319.wav	2.78	It's ahead of Labour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_320.wav	4.48	His replacement was named yesterday, following inquiries by The Herald.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_321.wav	2.56	I welcome this new service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_322.wav	4.95	Then it developed into civil and criminal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_323.wav	3.20	She now suffers from multiple sclerosis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_324.wav	3.24	Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_325.wav	3.03	It was a UK-wide report.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_326.wav	2.22	The law should be changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_327.wav	3.16	This is a dreadful day for Iona.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_328.wav	3.42	He spoke about the choices facing them, and their country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_329.wav	2.26	I will be standing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_330.wav	3.33	Lara is very, very much a girl.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_331.wav	3.20	It could be done by experts and lawyers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_332.wav	2.44	Are you from the rugby?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_333.wav	2.91	The attack was totally unprovoked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_334.wav	2.48	The plot is simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_335.wav	3.07	They've not let anyone into the loop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_336.wav	4.10	So just what is her enduring appeal?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_337.wav	3.16	With actors it is slightly different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_338.wav	4.44	I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_339.wav	2.94	Last night was a key episode.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_340.wav	2.31	What did we learn?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_341.wav	3.72	Looking at him is proof of the pudding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_342.wav	2.43	I knew he was dying.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_343.wav	3.12	He's a key player in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_344.wav	2.61	He loved his children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_345.wav	3.03	She wondered why we were interested.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_346.wav	3.25	The story was being repeated across Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_347.wav	3.46	An appeal was made to the presiding officer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_348.wav	3.33	I am content with the silver.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_349.wav	2.86	People acted too quickly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_350.wav	4.14	This, too, could provoke a risky business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_351.wav	3.03	We took the chances when they came.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_352.wav	3.71	You have to audition for jobs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_353.wav	3.76	What would you do if you didn't work?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_354.wav	3.07	Ferguson should take note.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_355.wav	4.65	We have always been, and remain confident of the securing of order.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_356.wav	4.53	Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_357.wav	3.55	The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_358.wav	3.59	They've got three-quarters of the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_359.wav	3.25	It gave no further details.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_360.wav	2.99	This man is serious about his work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_361.wav	3.72	I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_362.wav	2.95	She was released from hospital yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_363.wav	3.67	Her mother said, She didn't look very well at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_364.wav	3.16	It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_365.wav	3.20	The move follows a review of the Singapore
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_366.wav	2.61	We will miss him very much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_367.wav	2.74	This was a chilling echo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_368.wav	3.37	As a nation, we must become more active.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_369.wav	3.29	This gives a financial incentive to switch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_370.wav	3.97	It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_371.wav	2.60	January is a bad time of year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_372.wav	3.16	Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_373.wav	3.80	Liberal Democrat leader makes the hash of it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_374.wav	4.48	They are a very powerful and tasty side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_375.wav	3.54	This is a huge boost for my confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_376.wav	2.52	I'm delighted for Simon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_377.wav	3.29	His third goal was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_378.wav	2.31	Here we have not had one hour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_379.wav	3.12	He said to me, Which one, son?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_380.wav	2.90	I don't have a problem with getting older.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_381.wav	3.29	His son is a local legend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_382.wav	2.44	I was so nervous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_383.wav	2.44	The attacker has been put in foster care.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_384.wav	2.95	His death was a tragic accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_385.wav	2.99	It's to do with context.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_386.wav	3.12	This fight is not going to go away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_387.wav	4.82	At present it is fairly uncommon, but its incidence is increasing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_388.wav	2.35	I just don't know where he is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_389.wav	1.96	Would you take them?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_390.wav	2.90	I find it puzzling and disturbing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_391.wav	2.99	Golf is an expensive game for beginners.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_392.wav	2.69	He would take up the bike.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_393.wav	2.86	A world away from Rangers, you might say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_394.wav	2.35	He sat down at the piano.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_395.wav	2.90	His condition was stable last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_396.wav	2.69	The sun is worth a million dollars.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_397.wav	3.37	Being captain of this club is fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_398.wav	2.18	I'm sure they love it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_399.wav	2.52	I'd never seen a play about me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_400.wav	2.77	The track is currently covered in snow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_401.wav	3.12	And they all had these other commitments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_402.wav	2.86	The report is due out next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_403.wav	4.02	It was nerve-racking to watch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_404.wav	2.82	We are going to change our party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_405.wav	2.65	It's the same as Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_406.wav	2.82	This seems like a very good idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_407.wav	3.46	My wife and family are the support system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_408.wav	2.91	It remains in public ownership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_409.wav	3.20	The Master was by then just too old.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_410.wav	4.18	All credit to them, they took their chances, we didn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_411.wav	3.16	He added, We are not prepared for war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_412.wav	3.20	Sub Not Used, McArthur.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_413.wav	2.95	The hangover was Olympian.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_414.wav	2.65	We are here for the long term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_415.wav	4.44	More likely, perhaps, is that he will stay in England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_416.wav	2.56	A great deal has been achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_417.wav	3.29	Some things in life you have to accept.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_418.wav	3.80	However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_419.wav	3.97	This is a thoroughly handsome and enjoyable production.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_420.wav	3.71	No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_421.wav	2.82	I think it is totally wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_422.wav	3.12	It's not realistic because it's early days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_423.wav	3.16	It is par for the course, isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p334\p334_424.wav	3.50	Sutton is playing as well as ever today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_001.wav	2.65	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_002.wav	6.15	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_003.wav	10.37	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_004.wav	8.36	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_005.wav	9.05	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_006.wav	8.71	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_007.wav	6.87	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_008.wav	11.23	These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_010.wav	4.57	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_011.wav	9.90	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_012.wav	6.66	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_013.wav	6.91	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_014.wav	7.04	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_015.wav	10.93	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_016.wav	7.60	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_017.wav	4.61	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_018.wav	6.57	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_019.wav	10.33	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_020.wav	5.25	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_021.wav	11.95	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_022.wav	8.28	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_023.wav	15.54	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_024.wav	8.54	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_025.wav	4.40	He was born in London of Scottish parents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_026.wav	4.06	Her condition last night was described as critical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_027.wav	3.03	I believe in the Church.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_028.wav	3.29	Let's not go overboard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_029.wav	3.93	Frankly, it was worth the booking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_030.wav	4.14	They tend to be easily influenced by others.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_031.wav	4.57	It's about bringing people in, breaking down barriers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_032.wav	3.46	Well, what do you know?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_033.wav	2.90	But she was very human.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_034.wav	4.27	There are some serious ethical issues involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_035.wav	4.48	If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_036.wav	5.12	Pupils and staff were sent home early.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_037.wav	3.63	There were no proposals on the table.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_038.wav	3.29	Who does he think will win?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_039.wav	3.63	He will emerge as a world leader.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_040.wav	3.58	It opens the door to the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_041.wav	3.50	I only half believed it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_042.wav	5.38	It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_043.wav	4.27	All the oil companies are talking together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_044.wav	3.08	The failings are serious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_045.wav	4.27	The prognosis is excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_046.wav	3.67	Rangers deserved to beat us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_047.wav	4.18	That, though, is the measure of the man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_048.wav	4.40	On reflection, it is more than that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_049.wav	3.16	It is not normal practice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_050.wav	3.25	But he just carried on anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_051.wav	3.50	They couldn't believe what had happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_052.wav	2.82	I would not want to be young again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_053.wav	5.21	Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_054.wav	4.44	The Yugoslav army will still be there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_055.wav	6.79	There are schoolboys in uniform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_056.wav	3.59	I don't want to hear any excuses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_057.wav	4.52	They were later discharged from hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_058.wav	3.29	Let's see that increase over the years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_059.wav	4.78	I've learned a lot, and tomorrow is another day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_060.wav	4.14	These findings would be made public.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_061.wav	4.69	It's the most beautiful place on earth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_062.wav	6.32	I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_063.wav	3.29	I've learned from my mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_064.wav	2.48	This must be wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_065.wav	5.17	He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_066.wav	5.04	It probably didn't feel anything, she added.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_067.wav	3.46	I go home only once.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_068.wav	3.59	I am delighted to hear this wonderful news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_069.wav	2.73	It is a family day out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_070.wav	4.06	On that basis, he would set it aside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_071.wav	5.42	I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_072.wav	2.78	Bin Laden was not mentioned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_073.wav	4.06	Seven people were later detained by police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_074.wav	4.01	The team this year is going places.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_075.wav	4.01	We should do everything at a stroke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_076.wav	2.90	He had a moustache.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_077.wav	2.44	It's just for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_078.wav	3.84	History is usually written by the victors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_079.wav	3.54	It plans to return to this field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_080.wav	4.78	He said because people had invited him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_081.wav	2.56	That would be dangerous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_082.wav	3.24	Its workforce is to be made redundant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_083.wav	4.66	We aim to put them out of business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_084.wav	3.37	They're completely different from each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_085.wav	2.99	He was extremely nervous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_086.wav	3.16	Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_087.wav	3.97	Correction, knowing him, he might.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_088.wav	3.46	I came up through the ranks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_089.wav	3.07	We still don't know what's happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_090.wav	3.16	His team management was protective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_091.wav	3.12	The proposal was rejected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_092.wav	4.95	First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_093.wav	3.97	We wanted it left for a wee while.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_094.wav	3.29	Four other charges were dropped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_095.wav	3.16	These guys will not lie down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_096.wav	3.12	I would think they are just behind them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_097.wav	2.82	You can expect a hell of a fuss.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_098.wav	4.40	Harrowing is easy, after all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_099.wav	3.42	That is nearly four people every day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_100.wav	4.14	There are nine people here now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_101.wav	3.21	I like what has happened!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_102.wav	3.33	This would not be my first choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_103.wav	2.56	We knew nothing about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_104.wav	5.42	Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_105.wav	3.55	Which perhaps is just as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_106.wav	3.89	It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_107.wav	3.24	They receive a high profile in the media.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_108.wav	4.61	They have got their position, we have got our position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_109.wav	4.61	There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_110.wav	2.13	Or was it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_111.wav	2.39	It is not fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_112.wav	4.10	I saw military vehicles in the distance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_113.wav	5.68	Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_114.wav	3.03	The dealer is on notice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_115.wav	2.48	But it will backfire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_116.wav	3.37	We kept going right to the final whistle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_117.wav	3.29	Police were also perplexed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_118.wav	4.22	For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_119.wav	3.63	Britain may now be forced to listen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_120.wav	6.74	JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_121.wav	3.63	The final stage is paranoia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_122.wav	3.63	I am not holding the club to ransom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_123.wav	2.99	Wagner was never like this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_124.wav	2.99	The plane was in flames
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_125.wav	4.23	We represent a wide range of society.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_126.wav	3.50	Pig farmers are completely despondent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_127.wav	3.25	I've seen some of the submissions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_128.wav	3.50	It was meant to rival the dollar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_129.wav	3.29	A win was a real achievement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_130.wav	3.41	This is the high point of my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_131.wav	4.19	That's the sort of game you want.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_132.wav	2.95	My duty is to win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_133.wav	4.01	Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_134.wav	3.37	We are trying to clarify the issues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_135.wav	3.72	These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_136.wav	5.29	Suddenly, directing was the thing he wanted to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_137.wav	3.93	I am prepared to help make it happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_138.wav	3.42	This is not presently the case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_139.wav	3.58	It was a moment of madness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_140.wav	3.16	Don't even bother applying.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_141.wav	3.54	We haven't seen from the Bank of Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_142.wav	4.01	I do not own the vessel in question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_143.wav	4.48	Racism has no place in any sport.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_144.wav	6.15	It's all too short term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_145.wav	3.20	It's too big a risk to take.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_146.wav	4.23	Mummy believed in one thing above all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_147.wav	3.46	It was worth a photograph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_148.wav	4.36	Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_149.wav	4.27	We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_150.wav	3.80	The pilot was making a visual approach.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_151.wav	3.12	I'd say we should give it a week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_152.wav	3.29	The elections should have no role in this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_153.wav	3.33	There was a lot of resentment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_154.wav	2.82	Where is the anthrax?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_155.wav	5.38	I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_156.wav	5.42	Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_157.wav	3.63	It's because they can't understand the language.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_158.wav	3.50	That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_159.wav	4.61	He realises he has hit a glass ceiling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_160.wav	3.71	This is good news for the Western Isles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_161.wav	2.65	It's been a good year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_162.wav	3.16	We've got the top three.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_163.wav	3.25	But the price has been very high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_164.wav	4.18	I'm very surprised and obviously delighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_165.wav	3.20	That nation is South Africa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_166.wav	3.89	This will secure the future of our industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_167.wav	3.38	It's just a normal life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_168.wav	4.82	However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_169.wav	2.65	Where is the structure?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_170.wav	4.10	Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_171.wav	2.78	There's still time for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_172.wav	3.84	That's when you hope to take advantage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_173.wav	3.80	He is the example for all of us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_174.wav	2.94	It was an empowering journey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_175.wav	3.59	Stewart will travel with some confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_176.wav	3.85	Laura is an investment banker.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_177.wav	3.42	Teams are always interesting to watch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_178.wav	4.61	Market research indicates that this is not feasible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_179.wav	3.93	They had been together for about three years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_180.wav	3.63	What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_181.wav	2.99	Our customers come first.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_182.wav	3.50	Children are using books in a terrible condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_183.wav	4.40	Whether this return was too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_184.wav	3.59	We didn't think anything would happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_185.wav	2.99	He had come of age.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_186.wav	4.87	McCall is unlikely to change a winning team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_187.wav	3.55	We do things in an appropriate way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_188.wav	3.33	We just want to get stuck in now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_189.wav	2.56	Do you come from Moscow?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_190.wav	3.08	Broomfield was the centre of the town.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_191.wav	4.74	It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_192.wav	2.65	That wasn't for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_193.wav	2.86	I am delighted with today's win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_194.wav	3.20	We are aware of the tribunal case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_195.wav	4.19	The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_196.wav	5.12	We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_197.wav	5.59	Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_198.wav	4.53	He added,  It is all about the search for power.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_199.wav	4.10	There we were on the first tee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_200.wav	3.59	Next time around, it will be different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_201.wav	3.16	Broke the birdie record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_202.wav	2.94	I looked forward to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_203.wav	4.06	That is a brand name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_204.wav	2.94	She was an only child.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_205.wav	2.99	It is best value.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_206.wav	3.24	The text is reduced to bubbles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_207.wav	3.50	They should come forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_208.wav	4.27	We don't say there was a massacre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_209.wav	3.67	That has not changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_210.wav	3.42	John Lennon is a very large industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_211.wav	2.99	The island will never recover.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_212.wav	2.56	We are not ruling it out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_213.wav	2.82	You saw the pain he was in.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_214.wav	3.16	That is not an easy thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_215.wav	3.93	Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_216.wav	4.31	Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_217.wav	3.42	This doesn't have to be our future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_218.wav	2.86	It is a court case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_219.wav	2.90	She was a delightful person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_220.wav	3.63	They will have to make changes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_221.wav	2.39	The next one comes up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_222.wav	4.40	This fact is supported by audience research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_223.wav	4.44	Of further privacy, he had no need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_224.wav	3.93	We have great sympathy with Danny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_225.wav	4.61	Come to that, is any of this really happening?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_226.wav	3.29	Both sides have to step back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_227.wav	3.03	This is wonderful news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_228.wav	3.16	My dad was working in Ayrshire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_229.wav	5.42	But if they were there, they were keeping a low profile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_230.wav	4.14	It shows that painting is still relevant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_231.wav	4.31	They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_232.wav	2.95	It sounds a bit of an own goal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_233.wav	3.08	We are ready for the long haul.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_234.wav	4.65	We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_235.wav	3.80	This is a big step up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_236.wav	4.35	I don't have any answer for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_237.wav	4.74	Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_238.wav	4.35	I look for dancers who are also actors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_239.wav	6.06	However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_240.wav	3.84	EMI is a prime example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_241.wav	4.40	The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_242.wav	3.80	You cannot allow it to go on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_243.wav	5.04	It's a record label, not a form of music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_244.wav	4.40	Not that Agassi was a believer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_245.wav	3.46	A friendship that will endure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_246.wav	4.06	Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_247.wav	5.04	It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_248.wav	3.54	I am deeply sorry they did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_249.wav	3.54	Nowadays, it is workers united.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_250.wav	4.14	Alex is a big part of that future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_251.wav	2.56	Who would have thought it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_252.wav	2.95	I think he was surprised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_253.wav	3.85	I played well on Saturday and again today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_254.wav	4.44	Finally action had been taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_255.wav	5.04	Then there's the problem of sympathy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_256.wav	5.16	He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_257.wav	2.82	That gives us a bit of a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_258.wav	2.39	I watched a game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_259.wav	4.91	That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_260.wav	4.95	Blair is very positive at European Councils.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_261.wav	6.49	Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_262.wav	4.23	Intensive care has been very busy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_263.wav	4.14	There was no let-up for the minnows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_264.wav	2.99	I try not to expect anything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_265.wav	2.95	This is my home town.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_266.wav	2.73	I think we've got the balance right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_267.wav	4.36	We will build upon the basic state pension.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_268.wav	3.46	I have good memories of Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_269.wav	3.59	Nothing can bring back their son.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_270.wav	5.08	It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_271.wav	3.54	Some may end up in hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_272.wav	4.86	He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_273.wav	4.48	The council has been open and transparent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_274.wav	3.42	We can do nothing about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_275.wav	4.78	Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_276.wav	3.20	That is highly unfair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_277.wav	4.18	There is great demand for human cloning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_278.wav	3.20	I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_279.wav	2.82	Or rather he did and he didn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_280.wav	5.59	Scots actors should be so lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_281.wav	4.48	Government sources said, It is building up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_282.wav	3.67	Arsenal considered the job done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_283.wav	3.54	I think it will make a huge difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_284.wav	3.16	Bob Dylan is getting old.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_285.wav	3.93	The company yesterday refused to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_286.wav	4.31	Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_287.wav	3.25	Others were even less confident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_288.wav	3.80	I just want to change my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_289.wav	3.03	On occasions he succeeded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_290.wav	4.06	He did not oppose the divorce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_291.wav	4.40	Famously, though, there was a catch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_292.wav	4.57	There are so many people to thank.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_293.wav	4.95	Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_294.wav	4.10	He is also a great finisher.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_295.wav	4.10	He knew it would cost him millions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_296.wav	2.39	I'd never be free.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_297.wav	5.12	Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_298.wav	3.25	A counter reaction was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_299.wav	2.60	He said he was sorry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_300.wav	4.53	Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_301.wav	5.68	Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_302.wav	4.14	This will help our confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_303.wav	4.74	This looks like it is anything but open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_304.wav	4.52	We are now setting about finding them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_305.wav	5.29	In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_306.wav	3.67	If not, he should go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_307.wav	3.24	We must not go down that road.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_308.wav	4.44	It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_309.wav	4.40	Luckily for us, he enjoyed the experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_310.wav	3.29	I am not among its admirers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_311.wav	3.97	Hitches can be expected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_312.wav	3.76	He wasn't ready to cope with the pressures.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_313.wav	3.16	The issues are very intense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_314.wav	5.42	This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_315.wav	3.33	I feel sorry for the Reds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_316.wav	3.50	The company's in good shape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_317.wav	2.91	Dialogue is the key.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_318.wav	3.20	The actors are confident and polished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_319.wav	3.97	They have shown a great desire and attitude.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_320.wav	3.89	I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_321.wav	4.57	Motherwell have no such good fortune.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_322.wav	4.44	But he is revelling in the big stage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_323.wav	4.82	And who were they anyway, beforehand?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_324.wav	3.12	You have to think not.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_325.wav	3.80	Stock markets will be watching closely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_326.wav	3.12	This is a national crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_327.wav	4.18	If they have City backing, what is the influence?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_328.wav	5.04	Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_329.wav	4.91	In Europe, it is always over two games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_330.wav	2.99	The whole thing would be perfect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_331.wav	3.59	There's a tremendous amount of adventure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_332.wav	4.36	As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_333.wav	4.44	There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_334.wav	4.52	However, we had no failures in our side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_335.wav	3.50	I don't have any more contact with Airdrie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_336.wav	3.33	We will be stronger in Berlin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_337.wav	2.65	It is so damaging.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_338.wav	2.65	I put pressure on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_339.wav	5.38	Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_340.wav	3.29	I'm the one who has to suffer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_341.wav	4.39	With us, we just want them to respond.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_342.wav	4.70	He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_343.wav	4.18	And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_344.wav	3.33	They are the heroes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_345.wav	3.33	The songs are just so good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_346.wav	3.37	We have rebuilt and reformed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_347.wav	3.88	Scottish life can be like this, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_348.wav	3.16	It was certainly intense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_349.wav	4.48	It was not confirmed by Scotland Yard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_350.wav	3.93	He refused to discuss his imminent retiral.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_351.wav	4.40	He denied that taxpayers money was involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_352.wav	3.29	We were a shambles at the back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_353.wav	3.71	Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_354.wav	3.46	It took more than two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_355.wav	3.67	There is access for disabled people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_356.wav	3.76	The home was now under new management.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_357.wav	3.46	All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_358.wav	3.29	Is my wife a racist?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_359.wav	3.63	It is like a theatre of the absurd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_360.wav	2.74	There is no openness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_361.wav	4.14	It's being very carefully looked at.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_362.wav	3.80	It feels like too much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_363.wav	3.80	It was a job he loved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_364.wav	5.38	It may encourage more people to prospect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_365.wav	3.54	But let's not get carried away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_366.wav	4.27	There was some merit in that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_367.wav	4.31	She is believed to be in South Africa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_368.wav	4.48	Its people are inventive, talented and diligent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_369.wav	4.27	This is the last thing we ever expected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_370.wav	3.59	It looks like paradise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_371.wav	4.40	This means a great deal to the families.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_372.wav	4.95	At the moment, it is being treated as a tragic accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_373.wav	3.63	We were short of athletes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_374.wav	4.18	Six other people were injured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_375.wav	5.93	They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_376.wav	3.97	The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_377.wav	3.97	Only local people are helping.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_378.wav	4.39	There were three boys and two girls.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_379.wav	3.72	There's no support for it at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_380.wav	6.87	Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_381.wav	4.87	You're not stopping people using sunbeds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_382.wav	4.44	Writing has diminished in value.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_383.wav	3.37	There is a job to be done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_384.wav	3.54	Scotland is too small a country for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_385.wav	3.50	I am not obsessed with sex.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_386.wav	5.29	Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_387.wav	3.42	It's our worst nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_388.wav	3.80	I can't believe what has happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_389.wav	2.73	It's about my time as a guitarist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_390.wav	3.29	It's really nothing new.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_391.wav	3.72	You do that because you want to win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_392.wav	3.25	We have been working closely with Holyrood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_393.wav	4.95	From then on, Scott has never looked back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_394.wav	3.76	Partition is not an option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_395.wav	4.10	We have been treated with complete contempt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_396.wav	2.82	I'll tell you honestly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_397.wav	4.52	The home team had an amazing start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_398.wav	5.59	He became the focus of surrounding interest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_399.wav	6.49	It is a comforting fantasy - but it remains a fantasy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_400.wav	3.88	The conclusion is enthralling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_401.wav	4.31	This is usually done by the space shuttle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_402.wav	4.14	The review has been conducted fairly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_403.wav	5.42	Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_404.wav	4.23	Friends of the family have given their support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_405.wav	2.78	You name it, they have it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_406.wav	3.50	We are obviously disturbed by this case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_407.wav	2.69	There was no cohesion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_408.wav	2.60	There is no going back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_409.wav	4.40	We could play someone else, but he is ready to play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_410.wav	5.77	Courtenay took over on tour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_411.wav	5.72	He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_412.wav	2.99	The game is now open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_413.wav	4.10	Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_414.wav	3.37	Jackson may well be right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_415.wav	3.67	I am in a very difficult position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_416.wav	4.02	They will run in tandem with New Work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_417.wav	4.87	THE pain was almost too much to bear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_418.wav	5.04	Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_419.wav	3.41	He is not very big, either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_420.wav	4.27	Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_421.wav	2.78	But who gets on the tube?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_422.wav	3.29	We are encouraged by the news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_423.wav	5.51	In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p335\p335_424.wav	0.43	Happily we found it in the library.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_001.wav	2.30	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_002.wav	3.88	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_003.wav	7.34	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_004.wav	5.21	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_005.wav	6.74	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_006.wav	6.19	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_007.wav	5.12	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_008.wav	7.64	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_009.wav	5.08	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_010.wav	3.80	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_011.wav	8.15	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_012.wav	9.95	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_013.wav	5.08	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_014.wav	5.34	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_015.wav	5.98	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_016.wav	8.58	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_017.wav	4.53	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_018.wav	7.00	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_019.wav	7.68	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_020.wav	4.31	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_021.wav	9.73	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_022.wav	7.98	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_023.wav	13.61	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed forms yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_024.wav	7.94	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_025.wav	2.82	I am very happy with the result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_026.wav	2.95	She took them for a term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_027.wav	2.39	It is deeply worrying.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_028.wav	2.73	This is a very interesting move.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_029.wav	2.26	Are we not men?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_030.wav	2.14	How could it not?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_031.wav	3.54	It is sending the wrong message to people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_032.wav	3.97	Another former manager, Bobby Robson said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_033.wav	1.80	We are proud of them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_034.wav	3.37	We had a really good experience with David.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_035.wav	2.39	It was another good idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_036.wav	2.78	I want to make a vigorous defence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_037.wav	3.29	That incident altered the pattern of the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_038.wav	3.03	IT is a terrible equation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_039.wav	2.95	That gives us something to kick against.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_040.wav	3.16	It was pretty special.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_041.wav	3.58	Whatever we are doing, they have good reason to come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_042.wav	1.97	I should say so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_043.wav	2.43	Yet therein is the problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_044.wav	2.39	This isn't a new problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_045.wav	3.25	That, though, was just the start of it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_046.wav	2.35	My office is down there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_047.wav	3.20	There can be no dispute about our history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_048.wav	2.01	The crowd was waiting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_049.wav	1.75	It was a joy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_050.wav	2.35	It's the same with cinema.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_051.wav	2.48	It was the climax of the thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_052.wav	2.48	He died from multiple injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_053.wav	1.92	It is nearly there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_054.wav	2.65	I'm going to buy a car.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_055.wav	2.83	We said, What do you mean?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_056.wav	2.99	I have been there many times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_057.wav	3.20	The crackdown is launched today by the government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_058.wav	2.35	This ruling is a farce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_059.wav	2.39	They enjoy playing the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_060.wav	3.25	It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_061.wav	3.29	It is not standing army.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_062.wav	3.33	It was a crucial moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_063.wav	3.25	Someone else has now got them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_064.wav	1.96	The second is freedom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_065.wav	2.56	I let go the telephone and ran.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_066.wav	1.88	Get used to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_067.wav	3.16	For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_068.wav	3.63	Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_069.wav	3.63	After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_070.wav	3.71	Sadly, in this case, that was not so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_071.wav	3.38	The hearing was continued until a later date.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_072.wav	3.84	Still, some additions are inspired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_073.wav	2.69	Any error is severely punished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_074.wav	3.46	Yet what is supposed to be said?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_075.wav	2.69	But we will learn from that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_076.wav	3.20	He has not created a Festival resource.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_077.wav	2.13	We couldn't afford it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_078.wav	1.84	I get the bus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_079.wav	3.93	I might have been sitting at home, with her out here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_080.wav	3.46	Frankly, we should all have such problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_081.wav	2.91	The issues are not going to change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_082.wav	3.29	Four minutes later, the show was over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_083.wav	3.16	Would you have ever believed that was possible?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_084.wav	2.35	It will be easier for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_085.wav	2.01	I don't think it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_086.wav	2.48	There are no other contenders.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_087.wav	2.05	On that they agree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_088.wav	3.03	They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_089.wav	2.31	But who was driving it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_090.wav	2.86	We have to get this sorted out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_091.wav	2.05	It was very fast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_092.wav	2.44	Singing is my first love.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_093.wav	3.16	When is it ever anything else?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_094.wav	2.22	It's hard to see it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_095.wav	2.43	I believe in trade unions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_096.wav	3.80	Sub Not Used, Mackay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_097.wav	2.82	This is in a league of its own.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_098.wav	2.95	The partnership was set up during the summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_099.wav	3.33	That statement has never been withdrawn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_100.wav	2.86	The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_101.wav	2.91	That is unlikely to happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_102.wav	2.69	That is a mark of what you are.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_103.wav	2.14	This is not finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_104.wav	2.27	It was one of the firemen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_105.wav	3.29	Now, she has completed a family tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_106.wav	1.79	Don't you believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_107.wav	2.77	There is another important factor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_108.wav	2.01	Most people know that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_109.wav	2.09	I want to keep playing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_110.wav	3.46	At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_111.wav	3.97	The first is in Whitehall, the second in Brussels.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_112.wav	2.52	That is how we will be judged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_113.wav	2.94	It's there for people to look at.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_114.wav	1.75	We are getting there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_115.wav	2.56	I just couldn't believe what had happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_116.wav	3.03	They never got into the show this time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_117.wav	3.33	He, too, is keen to redress the balance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_118.wav	2.05	But no, it's not funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_119.wav	2.78	We just try to make great records.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_120.wav	3.07	It's almost certainly not going to help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_121.wav	2.43	Why does it come out now?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_122.wav	2.95	In that case, the children were not missing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_123.wav	2.85	These figures are truly awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_124.wav	2.86	The whole thing was just unreal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_125.wav	3.25	They haven't been thought through.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_126.wav	5.47	They have their own audience in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_127.wav	2.89	It's better than that, it's fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_128.wav	2.78	The criteria have changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_129.wav	2.52	Everyone in front of me was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_130.wav	3.67	Audacious decisions were taken early on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_131.wav	3.16	I have thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_132.wav	2.86	I just have no maternal instincts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_133.wav	2.27	It has been declared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_134.wav	3.20	His commitment, on the other hand, is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_135.wav	3.20	Clearly, audiences are unsettled.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_136.wav	2.48	It's very hard to plan for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_137.wav	2.57	There is nothing like this back home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_138.wav	3.03	They are declining elsewhere in the UK.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_139.wav	1.58	He is that good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_140.wav	2.27	We did not have a clue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_141.wav	2.52	We need to be more specific.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_142.wav	3.38	This is the man who provides the hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_143.wav	2.65	This is a war over our home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_144.wav	2.48	He's got me very well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_145.wav	2.60	He has been banned from the Salmon Inn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_146.wav	2.22	He was always nice to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_147.wav	2.52	He looked at me before replying.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_148.wav	3.03	Then there is the Mini itself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_149.wav	2.82	This may be perfectly innocent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_150.wav	1.97	It's good for the city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_151.wav	3.71	The only answer is a public inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_152.wav	3.50	Controllers major concern is safety.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_153.wav	2.65	It's like an extension of your body.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_154.wav	2.26	Because he usually is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_155.wav	3.20	It's very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_156.wav	3.41	We have waited a long time for this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_157.wav	2.91	I want my audience to be challenged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_158.wav	2.90	This is the culture change in medicine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_159.wav	2.35	Who do you think you are?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_160.wav	3.20	Parliament was evenly divided on the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_161.wav	2.48	I have no battle with the Scots.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_162.wav	2.35	I hope he gets it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_163.wav	2.52	Everything has its place and purpose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_164.wav	3.37	Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_165.wav	2.78	I am here to work for Scottish Labour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_166.wav	2.26	Nobody could survive on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_167.wav	2.57	I can't do anything before nine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_168.wav	2.35	Their vision was not impeded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_169.wav	2.61	He is married with three children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_170.wav	2.26	These days will be back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_171.wav	2.90	However, they should not come as a surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_172.wav	2.43	It could last five months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_173.wav	2.18	Everything is accounted for.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_174.wav	3.16	The support from the general public was astounding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_175.wav	2.95	About time too, you might think.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_176.wav	2.65	However, it does not tell the full story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_177.wav	2.95	We have made mistakes and were badly punished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_178.wav	3.29	The bombing has had a huge influence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_179.wav	2.69	We've got a mixture of both.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_180.wav	2.09	I'm very happy to be here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_181.wav	2.91	This is not the case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_182.wav	2.84	This one was supposed to be so different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_183.wav	3.50	I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_184.wav	3.07	It has been difficult for her to do, he says.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_185.wav	2.99	They are now out in the cold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_186.wav	3.03	However, planners should be taking the lead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_187.wav	2.14	Cloning is not ready.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_188.wav	2.69	New Labour are running scared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_189.wav	2.56	It is a good result for Great Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_190.wav	2.86	The weekly average was three hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_191.wav	2.22	Is there a new way forward?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_192.wav	1.92	Don't hold your breath!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_193.wav	3.12	This is the start of a slippery slope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_194.wav	2.13	Where do you think she is going?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_195.wav	2.48	Safety is our first concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_196.wav	4.10	In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_197.wav	2.65	Inspections are not the problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_198.wav	2.14	But who will buy it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_199.wav	2.09	And it's more subversive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_200.wav	2.61	Openness is always the best way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_201.wav	1.62	It wouldn't go off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_202.wav	2.44	I've been enjoying it, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_203.wav	3.03	The professor said the results were positive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_204.wav	3.07	I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_205.wav	2.18	It's part of the end game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_206.wav	2.61	Do they play for the money?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_207.wav	3.12	The train was on time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_208.wav	2.69	So, where do we go from here?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_209.wav	3.37	The claim was denied by the first minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_210.wav	2.78	More than that, it's a vicious circle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_211.wav	2.82	And how much of a compliment is that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_213.wav	2.39	Politics is a tough game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_214.wav	2.56	I have friends in Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_215.wav	1.80	What has changed?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_216.wav	2.52	There's nothing to be gained by it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_217.wav	3.20	Chambers said he would accept the place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_218.wav	2.82	We have been through this with the lawyers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_219.wav	2.69	I'm not interested in the job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_220.wav	3.16	His contract was then not renewed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_221.wav	3.93	Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_222.wav	4.23	The warnings were a good reminder.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_223.wav	2.77	I came here this week to work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_224.wav	2.56	It's the last thing on my mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_225.wav	2.95	Barry Ferguson is one of them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_226.wav	3.20	The biggest resource is our staff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_227.wav	2.13	We have big ideas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_228.wav	2.18	How will we get there?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_229.wav	2.65	She told me to stop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_230.wav	2.65	I wish him well for the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_231.wav	3.16	Cars are great for going long distances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_232.wav	2.78	It's not a party, no, no.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_233.wav	2.48	The lads are having a tour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_234.wav	2.99	It may not be life long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_235.wav	2.39	Everyone was in tears.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_236.wav	2.39	It was just above the roof.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_237.wav	2.26	These were the dreams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_238.wav	2.61	But we must work in harmony.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_239.wav	2.69	It's a bit like a bereavement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_240.wav	1.96	There is no other way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_241.wav	2.95	Everyone must be focused on the league.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_242.wav	2.01	The English are coming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_243.wav	3.42	You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_244.wav	2.22	I believe in theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_245.wav	3.20	Only four of his passengers were uninjured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_246.wav	3.29	It's time to say enough is enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_247.wav	2.56	He has to pull back from the brink.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_248.wav	2.86	She has insisted she did nothing wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_249.wav	2.86	I don't have any regrets about the edit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_250.wav	2.48	That does not mean we have failed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_251.wav	2.73	The family baton is handed on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_252.wav	2.35	She has a little boy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_253.wav	2.90	Our policy is very clear on this issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_254.wav	2.43	He has refused to do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_255.wav	2.52	I can understand why they have gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_256.wav	2.65	All my training is for Athens.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_257.wav	2.65	This is a personal decision for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_258.wav	1.88	When will you listen?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_259.wav	2.39	I'm happy that we have agreed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_260.wav	2.05	All of them were killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_261.wav	2.99	All the children on the roll are genuine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_262.wav	3.59	Sub Not Used, McCormick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_263.wav	2.69	You can spend money on housing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_264.wav	2.52	Ferguson must take the blame.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_265.wav	2.65	There is no point in denying that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_266.wav	2.56	The kids are paying the price.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_267.wav	2.14	Not that it is unique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_268.wav	2.35	We're all going to take a holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_269.wav	2.60	I've got three other ideas for the day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_270.wav	2.82	Some injustice was committed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_271.wav	2.22	I've had a wonderful career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_272.wav	2.48	The BBC was a disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_273.wav	2.22	I didn't expect to be in.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_274.wav	2.77	The Cabinet is split over the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_275.wav	2.78	I reckon he won't make the mistake again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_276.wav	2.30	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_277.wav	2.56	If so, we want to hear from them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_278.wav	2.35	It's not covered by the insurance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_279.wav	2.18	He denied the charge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_280.wav	2.35	I was shaking on the blocks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_281.wav	2.18	There is no easy answer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_282.wav	2.26	I watch the other visitors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_283.wav	3.25	Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_284.wav	2.10	I am not a liar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_285.wav	3.33	The cause remained a mystery last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_286.wav	2.48	He had no problem with alcohol.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_287.wav	2.43	I had no experience at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_288.wav	2.52	Yet he remains confident enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_289.wav	2.35	It has become very confused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_290.wav	2.09	Fame and money followed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_291.wav	2.01	It's a national sport.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_292.wav	1.84	I just made it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_293.wav	2.01	There was no secrecy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_294.wav	2.95	A wide range of restrictions are in place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_295.wav	2.52	Even then it might be difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_296.wav	2.95	I can't believe we didn't win that game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_297.wav	3.84	Last night, the extent of the damage was emerging.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_299.wav	2.95	Relief was beyond belief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_300.wav	2.78	Beyond that would have been outrageous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_301.wav	2.43	It was complete nonsense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_302.wav	2.90	I seem to keep this for the majors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_303.wav	1.84	It is three years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_304.wav	2.11	They are not always the same person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_305.wav	2.31	We meet again in Berlin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_306.wav	2.82	This is a very special moment for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_307.wav	2.31	It is a daunting task.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_308.wav	3.03	Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_309.wav	2.65	We have chosen for the patients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_310.wav	1.97	That was me today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_311.wav	2.65	That is when we are really effective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_312.wav	2.18	They just would not have run away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_313.wav	2.90	But this isn't a play about The Troubles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_314.wav	2.82	This idea has been around for four years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_315.wav	3.07	But he made a mistake in picking it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_316.wav	2.48	This is an appealing record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_317.wav	3.03	They are a perfectly good thing in principle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_318.wav	3.50	Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_319.wav	3.16	This is a problem we have to tackle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_320.wav	2.60	Yes, it was uplifting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_321.wav	2.99	Nobody should believe this story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_322.wav	2.22	No person has been charged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_323.wav	3.12	One paper was not returned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_324.wav	2.65	I don't want to do too much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_325.wav	2.90	We don't have money to get to town.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_326.wav	1.84	We have great support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_327.wav	3.46	One would not want to go there anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_328.wav	2.86	And it's difficult to argue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_329.wav	2.18	We'll see what happens.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_330.wav	3.25	That could be in place by next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_331.wav	2.14	That's not part of the deal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_332.wav	2.01	There is a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_333.wav	2.27	He pretended not to care.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_334.wav	3.67	They are very concerned, and you can understand that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_335.wav	2.99	Not because they want to sing about something.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_336.wav	1.88	Was it too obvious?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_337.wav	1.88	Wouldn't it be nice?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_338.wav	2.56	I was in tears in the street.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_339.wav	2.95	Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_340.wav	3.03	It is a terrible thing to have happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_343.wav	3.63	The work was suspended following the kidnap.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_344.wav	3.08	Fifteen minutes later, they were found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_345.wav	2.01	That is why we are here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_346.wav	1.67	He wouldn't do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_347.wav	1.75	She becomes a mother.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_348.wav	2.90	He is very much respected within the group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_349.wav	2.01	People want to learn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_350.wav	2.26	Bomber was not amused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_351.wav	2.26	I am not a happy man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_352.wav	1.71	But it was fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_353.wav	3.03	Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_354.wav	3.20	No decisions have been made in this respect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_355.wav	2.39	It's been such a waste of money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_356.wav	1.96	Not so, it transpires.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_357.wav	2.99	Things don't look too good at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_358.wav	2.74	Inside, there is a kind of madness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_359.wav	1.71	I'd like to run.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_360.wav	2.95	Its future is no longer in question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_361.wav	2.95	But this relative success has not been easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_362.wav	1.58	I am a player.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_363.wav	3.12	I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_364.wav	1.84	He was not alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_365.wav	2.22	There was too much at stake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_366.wav	1.75	Who wouldn't do it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_368.wav	3.46	He was taken to hospital, but later died.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_369.wav	2.48	Eriksson would have approved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_370.wav	2.05	We are all in the frontline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_371.wav	2.01	It looked like a war zone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_372.wav	2.73	His behaviour today has been disgusting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_373.wav	2.48	Further expansion is possible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_374.wav	2.65	Tyson said he had made a mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_375.wav	2.65	I'm interested in all kinds of history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_376.wav	2.73	At this point we can only speculate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_377.wav	2.43	We know we have the quality.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_378.wav	3.03	In fact, he should never have been in the field.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_379.wav	2.22	It may be the first of many.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_380.wav	2.01	It runs in cycles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_381.wav	2.86	It is already making a difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_382.wav	1.92	I spoke to him yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_383.wav	2.48	We are looking very hard at ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_384.wav	2.69	This is the stuff of live music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_385.wav	2.86	We were beaten by the better team today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_386.wav	2.44	Taxes may need to rise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_387.wav	2.56	It's unusual to say the least.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_388.wav	3.80	I was quietly confident about getting the win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_389.wav	2.48	I am not going to sit back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_390.wav	2.05	But this is even worse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_391.wav	2.95	It left me with a sadness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_392.wav	2.73	I was living with my mum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_393.wav	3.67	The truth is he probably doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_394.wav	2.22	There were few surprises.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_395.wav	2.48	He is a one-off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_396.wav	2.90	And then he laughs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_397.wav	3.80	She is having an affair with his partner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_398.wav	2.17	He put a lot of effort into it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_399.wav	2.78	The pressure is enormous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_400.wav	2.22	I am not that sadistic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_401.wav	2.56	Are you all right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_402.wav	2.52	We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_403.wav	2.52	I'm certainly thinking about retirement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_404.wav	3.58	But we say Yes - and we are the people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_405.wav	1.71	Is it any good?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_406.wav	3.84	The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_407.wav	2.35	It would be that absurd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_408.wav	1.92	As if he would.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_409.wav	2.31	I just carry on with my work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_410.wav	2.31	She made no further comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_411.wav	3.46	His attacker has been a Rangers fan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_412.wav	3.46	He wants the festival to make a difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_413.wav	3.03	He didn't know it was his audition, but it was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_415.wav	2.20	The auction has seven days to run.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_416.wav	2.97	It is easy to be wise in hindsight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_417.wav	2.26	They want to prove a point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_418.wav	3.16	It is my decision and my decision alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_419.wav	2.65	Would he ever go back to the beginning?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_420.wav	1.92	What is going on?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_421.wav	2.22	Let that be their memorial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_422.wav	2.78	We thought we were looking in good shape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_423.wav	2.18	Tonight is very special.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p336\p336_424.wav	3.07	This is a matter of life and death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_001.wav	1.96	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_002.wav	3.33	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_003.wav	7.08	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a sack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_004.wav	4.86	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_005.wav	6.62	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_006.wav	5.98	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_007.wav	5.30	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_008.wav	8.07	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_009.wav	5.59	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_010.wav	2.99	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_011.wav	6.83	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_012.wav	5.53	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_013.wav	5.42	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_014.wav	5.85	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_015.wav	5.47	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_016.wav	6.53	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_017.wav	3.59	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_018.wav	5.25	Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_019.wav	7.85	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_020.wav	4.70	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_021.wav	9.69	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_022.wav	7.51	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_023.wav	12.25	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_024.wav	7.77	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_025.wav	3.71	They missed the boat and everyone suffers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_026.wav	4.01	The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_027.wav	3.46	Glasgow is far from overload.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_028.wav	2.90	It's a big mystery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_029.wav	2.35	What is a house without it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_030.wav	3.03	It was really good in the first week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_031.wav	2.39	It's about the balance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_032.wav	3.37	Like his acting, it was an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_033.wav	3.16	It really has not been their season.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_034.wav	3.67	I want somebody with something to prove.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_035.wav	3.37	This would give Scotland around eight members.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_036.wav	3.58	There was a ban on reporting the trial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_037.wav	2.91	I don't think the action was a mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_038.wav	2.69	You go in there and do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_039.wav	2.86	We were in Italy  suddenly, we knew.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_040.wav	2.52	What will happen to them today?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_041.wav	2.56	I didn't expect to get one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_042.wav	2.99	It was electric, amazing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_043.wav	2.18	I said to him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_044.wav	4.23	Labour has been found out on public spending.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_045.wav	2.30	he told a producer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_046.wav	3.03	That is not the place for her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_047.wav	3.08	The jury is still out on this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_048.wav	2.48	We have to work together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_049.wav	3.16	I don't think that he won't be released.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_050.wav	4.06	It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_051.wav	3.03	It means it is difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_052.wav	2.30	But they were true stories.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_053.wav	2.43	I needed to get away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_054.wav	2.95	I will make that point tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_055.wav	3.67	Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_056.wav	2.95	There are two things we have to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_057.wav	2.65	Are they going to work together again?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_058.wav	2.74	We need to do that every week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_059.wav	2.74	It gives us something to work on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_060.wav	2.48	But what did it matter?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_061.wav	3.80	A government is a government is a government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_062.wav	3.03	Hopefully it will be tomorrow night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_063.wav	2.61	I am not retaining him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_064.wav	2.73	The police are not the target.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_065.wav	2.95	It has affected it, obviously.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_066.wav	2.86	But that title is a mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_067.wav	3.03	And he's not a bigot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_068.wav	3.42	But summer is spent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_069.wav	3.50	Services are being expanded, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_070.wav	2.95	It has only been rumours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_071.wav	2.86	It is extremely fortunate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_072.wav	3.21	Today is the first step in that process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_073.wav	2.73	Several others were absent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_074.wav	3.63	It is surprising to come back this way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_075.wav	2.82	But there was no time for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_076.wav	2.73	A review is under way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_077.wav	1.88	That should be fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_078.wav	2.61	Maybe he will act again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_079.wav	2.56	What we were doing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_080.wav	2.99	What is the Barnett formula?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_081.wav	3.16	It all happened so suddenly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_082.wav	2.39	I won't let that happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_083.wav	2.05	Or have they?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_084.wav	6.40	There is no change in the strategy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_085.wav	3.37	I had a fortunate war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_086.wav	3.63	It will probably be my last, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_087.wav	3.59	I am not completely insane.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_088.wav	2.90	We spoke about a few people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_089.wav	2.77	She had to learn a new discipline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_090.wav	3.46	In fact, he took it very well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_091.wav	3.07	I decided to take my time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_092.wav	3.12	Quite a lot of people know that, actually.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_093.wav	2.43	We did it in one take.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_094.wav	2.69	He doesn't even know who he is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_095.wav	2.60	It is hard to understand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_096.wav	2.52	What will it be?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_097.wav	3.71	The search is due to be completed today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_098.wav	4.01	This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_099.wav	3.55	What you sow, you have to reap.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_100.wav	2.48	He is a one-off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_101.wav	2.56	Six men will take the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_102.wav	4.87	To have Mr Clinton is quite an accolade.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_103.wav	3.46	We should not be surprised at that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_104.wav	2.27	It was a disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_105.wav	2.39	We have been so lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_107.wav	3.25	It was a bit of a tightrope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_108.wav	2.43	I don't know what we're doing wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_109.wav	3.12	It was all over now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_110.wav	3.16	But it was only a matter of time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_111.wav	2.82	I always liked to get a laugh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_112.wav	2.48	I still hope to go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_113.wav	2.48	Sometimes they come off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_114.wav	2.35	We're not that bad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_115.wav	3.63	Today is a victory for the Scottish Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_116.wav	3.03	I feel strongly about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_117.wav	2.82	There are exciting days ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_118.wav	2.69	We have to put this behind us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_119.wav	1.88	I thought it was quite good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_120.wav	3.97	This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_121.wav	3.03	We're very, very happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_122.wav	2.95	There could be a possible connection.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_123.wav	3.46	But there was everything!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_124.wav	3.24	We are doing very well as we are.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_125.wav	2.18	The Scots are great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_126.wav	3.03	That imbalance was evident in their play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_127.wav	2.65	However, the drama was not over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_128.wav	2.69	But it was not just the land.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_129.wav	3.08	I don't think the referees are against us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_130.wav	2.69	It is too much for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_131.wav	3.63	It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_132.wav	2.18	We are still waiting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_133.wav	2.35	It happened again yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_134.wav	3.03	He will be a major challenger next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_135.wav	2.90	That question was never asked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_136.wav	2.43	I am not inclined to believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_137.wav	1.84	It was on fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_138.wav	2.86	I have fallen in love with the Highlands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_139.wav	1.80	How can they tell?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_140.wav	2.77	My ambition is to make the cut.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_141.wav	3.03	It will be for the committee to decide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_142.wav	4.18	Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_143.wav	2.69	Rangers must be winners, it says.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_144.wav	2.48	He was part of the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_145.wav	2.18	I certainly think it should be there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_146.wav	2.13	But it does not matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_147.wav	3.42	Hopefully we can put in a performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_148.wav	3.33	Sadly, he has a point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_149.wav	2.39	It was so sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_150.wav	2.95	Mind you, all was not lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_151.wav	2.74	We were extremely lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_152.wav	2.56	It was an amazing time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_153.wav	2.69	In fact, the reasons are simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_154.wav	3.12	The hearing is expected to continue today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_155.wav	2.35	It is just a matter of time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_156.wav	2.94	This news is really depressing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_157.wav	3.07	I'm not fit for anything else.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_158.wav	3.25	The day may come, but not for a while.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_159.wav	2.35	The enemy was time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_160.wav	3.07	He would have done the same to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_161.wav	2.31	What were they told?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_162.wav	2.26	More cases are expected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_163.wav	2.61	I believe the gap is nearly there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_164.wav	2.48	It would be very dangerous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_165.wav	2.01	How can they say that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_166.wav	2.26	My condition is not bad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_167.wav	2.78	Tomorrow is a big day for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_168.wav	2.99	I would like to make an impact, of course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_169.wav	3.12	I am confident of the outcome this week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_170.wav	2.31	The goal is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_171.wav	2.43	Just think about the lines.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_172.wav	2.91	It all depends on the wind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_173.wav	2.69	I was very influenced by him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_174.wav	3.20	I'm so worried about the roads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_175.wav	2.56	This was much worse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_176.wav	2.91	This was certainly not about money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_177.wav	2.65	It is simple, but profound.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_178.wav	2.52	The funding is now there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_179.wav	3.46	He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_180.wav	2.99	A film is different from a book.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_181.wav	2.78	Within three days he was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_182.wav	2.90	You'll find out on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_183.wav	3.25	Did they give any good advice?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_184.wav	3.03	We know that from recent experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_185.wav	3.71	From day one, we were a family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_186.wav	2.78	It separates the men from the boys.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_187.wav	2.39	This could be wonderful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_188.wav	2.35	He loved it, and so did they.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_189.wav	3.12	The other was a football match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_190.wav	2.56	They have the players to do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_191.wav	1.84	Which is worse?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_192.wav	2.69	He has made a step forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_193.wav	2.14	That was very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_194.wav	2.61	This will have to change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_195.wav	2.86	First, the programme was unbalanced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_196.wav	2.52	It was a very strong metaphor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_197.wav	2.35	We are going to have a party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_198.wav	2.31	I have no problem with that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_199.wav	2.99	The Parliament will make its own decisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_200.wav	3.08	I'm very happy that it exploded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_201.wav	2.35	We're all paying for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_202.wav	2.26	Lester was like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_203.wav	3.58	Look at New Labour, it hasn't worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_204.wav	2.09	That's a matter for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_205.wav	3.54	We were never told it was already decided.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_206.wav	2.48	It is part of our heritage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_207.wav	2.56	It is not a road of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_208.wav	2.35	It is not as simple as that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_209.wav	2.82	Everything in the symphony is there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_210.wav	2.69	Find them somebody they deserve.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_211.wav	2.73	It's a big challenge for the audience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_212.wav	2.35	If that's the case, he will struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_213.wav	2.95	It has certainly paid off for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_214.wav	2.44	We're not getting involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_215.wav	1.67	The lottery has helped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_216.wav	1.97	They know the language.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_217.wav	3.42	The acting left a lot to be desired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_218.wav	2.43	We shall be victorious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_219.wav	2.60	The quality of work is very impressive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_220.wav	3.76	However, he added there were signs of progress.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_221.wav	3.07	You cannot do that in a lobby.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_222.wav	2.94	We will all suffer as a result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_223.wav	3.20	Without doubt, they can win the title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_224.wav	2.18	What's it about?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_225.wav	2.90	We are looking to the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_226.wav	2.22	The signs are positive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_227.wav	2.14	I called it right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_228.wav	2.18	I see it as my job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_229.wav	2.69	I have always believed in myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_230.wav	1.97	It has to be put in context.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_231.wav	2.13	I think we can get there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_232.wav	3.16	I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_233.wav	2.52	No, they have played well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_234.wav	3.50	The reaction of staff has been fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_235.wav	2.82	The answer is obviously no.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_236.wav	2.78	I'll take it as it comes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_237.wav	2.86	I think we're the better side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_238.wav	3.88	We act because we must.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_239.wav	4.44	There are two mysteries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_240.wav	2.56	The teacher would have approved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_241.wav	2.48	Are you going to win?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_242.wav	3.41	We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_243.wav	3.80	I could have been killed on that day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_244.wav	4.14	They have to come up with a solution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_245.wav	1.67	It is very enjoyable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_246.wav	2.78	Now, that would impress the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_247.wav	1.79	Did it work?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_248.wav	3.63	But that is for another day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_249.wav	3.63	There is a great carry over value.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_250.wav	2.52	It was not like that at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_251.wav	2.86	Police are appealing for witnesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_252.wav	2.60	I was very surprised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_253.wav	2.44	We all knew they could do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_254.wav	3.07	It's about taking risks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_255.wav	2.35	Why is this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_256.wav	2.91	He is due in Israel tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_257.wav	3.16	It was indeed a night to remember.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_258.wav	3.42	There are not too many like him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_259.wav	3.12	The memory is there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_260.wav	3.59	It was an amazing experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_261.wav	3.21	Nobody has been put on trial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_262.wav	1.79	He will go on the bench.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_263.wav	2.86	The police are hopeless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_264.wav	2.99	There are no plans to change this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_265.wav	2.90	We are deeply concerned at the announcement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_266.wav	3.20	A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_267.wav	3.33	That's the important thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_268.wav	3.67	Should he resign?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_269.wav	3.25	They have to live with the risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_270.wav	3.72	It is, but that's not the point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_271.wav	2.82	It was my whole life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_272.wav	2.56	It was a classic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_273.wav	3.71	This week is a perfect example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_274.wav	3.46	However, it is going to happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_275.wav	3.80	This time it really could happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_276.wav	3.58	That sort of thing is long gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_277.wav	2.99	That includes the equipment?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_278.wav	2.78	It does nothing for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_279.wav	3.03	That has been lost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_280.wav	2.48	But that's another story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_281.wav	2.52	I think it has worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_282.wav	3.46	No other family members could be contacted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_283.wav	2.91	There is nothing to be gained from that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_284.wav	2.86	We're very proud of him and his achievement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_285.wav	2.82	But do not rely on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_286.wav	1.79	I made a mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_287.wav	1.97	What do you want.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_288.wav	4.06	That prevented any recurrence of the problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_289.wav	2.78	I think we could do well in Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_290.wav	3.50	And yet, there has been no great impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_291.wav	3.16	Was that not awful?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_292.wav	3.33	Yesterday was a statement of intent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_293.wav	3.38	I'm not there yet but it is close.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_294.wav	2.95	But it will not work again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_295.wav	3.63	Even then he wanted to deflect attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_296.wav	2.56	I have nothing to say on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_297.wav	2.35	The rest is his own.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_298.wav	2.52	I have no worry about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_299.wav	3.42	There has been a fair bit in between, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_300.wav	2.69	Who was on the panel?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_301.wav	4.01	It turned out to have been three hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_302.wav	2.73	That is exactly right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_303.wav	2.65	That is not good for golf!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_304.wav	2.86	He had planned to sell it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_305.wav	2.39	We know the goals will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_306.wav	2.60	But it did not last.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_307.wav	3.03	They need to look after themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_308.wav	3.29	They will be stopped, and they will be punished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_309.wav	2.99	She asked for the appointment with me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_310.wav	2.35	We have nothing to lose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_311.wav	2.18	The first time it was rejected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_312.wav	2.39	He did not report it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_313.wav	2.35	No-one can take it in.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_314.wav	2.90	They were following his orders.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_315.wav	2.78	That is an entirely different discipline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_316.wav	2.60	It was an insult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_317.wav	2.95	Yet there is hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_318.wav	3.12	Referees in Scotland are very weak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_319.wav	2.69	It will not be easy for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_320.wav	2.90	That was a fairy tale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_321.wav	2.35	I would love to do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_322.wav	2.31	You'll have to wait and see.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_323.wav	2.22	It wasn't the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_324.wav	2.01	The number never came.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_325.wav	2.22	I really have to go now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_326.wav	2.77	We are going to listen to Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_327.wav	3.16	There isn't much of a scene in Austria.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_328.wav	2.14	Words are not enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_329.wav	2.77	He is in charge on the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_330.wav	2.13	We have expected it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_331.wav	2.99	Mr Blair was ready for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_332.wav	2.35	Well, that was the plan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_333.wav	3.20	The problem is fairly serious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_334.wav	2.60	No decisions have been taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_335.wav	2.05	We won't do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_336.wav	2.65	It's the body that counts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_337.wav	2.31	Sprinters are not fit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_338.wav	3.12	This has been coming for weeks and weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_339.wav	2.48	It's a double whammy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_340.wav	3.59	Charges against the pair were found not proven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_341.wav	2.73	Let's not make that mistake again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_342.wav	3.08	That's why he is the prime minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_343.wav	4.53	Only injury has prevented that happening before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_344.wav	2.99	They have to be dealt with.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_345.wav	2.60	His manager blamed the referee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_346.wav	2.56	So what was he really doing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_347.wav	2.56	I don't want to go anywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_348.wav	3.38	How do we get a bigger stage?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_349.wav	3.29	We're very close to being a good team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_350.wav	2.86	I thought their commitment was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_351.wav	2.60	That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_352.wav	2.90	My mind is the most important thing now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_353.wav	2.56	I had nothing to lose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_354.wav	2.99	This is a really serious issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_355.wav	2.05	I thought to myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_356.wav	1.79	Could it be?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_357.wav	2.48	We're talking to the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_358.wav	3.93	Thereafter they were again in control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_359.wav	2.82	It looks as though there is no chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_360.wav	2.65	You have to keep the focus alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_361.wav	2.01	It could have been a ceilidh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_362.wav	2.65	I cannot really commit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_363.wav	3.50	There are many questions to be answered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_364.wav	3.16	Sadly, so did a couple of errors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_365.wav	2.60	This is a new beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_366.wav	2.95	There are moments of honesty, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_367.wav	2.39	They will fight for everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_368.wav	2.18	He is doing just that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_369.wav	1.75	The night is young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_370.wav	2.56	But there are signs of a revival.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_371.wav	2.52	I thought it was a great game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_372.wav	1.58	Just get on with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_373.wav	3.46	Germany also said it was unimpressed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_374.wav	2.73	It shows the Government is listening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_375.wav	3.54	She's the runner - she makes the decisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_376.wav	2.22	They want it to work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_377.wav	3.37	This is a completely new experience for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_378.wav	2.01	They still have a great sense of humour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_379.wav	2.73	It decided to blame the media.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_380.wav	2.56	We have chosen for the patients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_381.wav	2.86	He was at the outset of his career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_382.wav	2.43	Our position is quite clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_383.wav	2.73	It could now be up to the courts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_384.wav	2.05	We can make a difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_385.wav	2.52	This was not a contest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_386.wav	2.94	So far the weather has been very pleasant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_387.wav	3.63	Breaching that condition was itself an offence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_388.wav	2.09	I cannot describe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_389.wav	2.56	It is not designed to kill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_390.wav	2.73	He has run a hell of a race.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_391.wav	3.29	We'll have to be satisfied with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_392.wav	3.33	Gordon Brown did not inherit a mess.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_393.wav	3.16	It is good football in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_394.wav	2.65	There is no other option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_395.wav	2.90	You can feel the tension in the air.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_396.wav	2.17	It is a technique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_397.wav	1.92	Is it the shape of things to come?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_398.wav	2.69	My body is exhausted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_399.wav	2.99	It is about more than Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_400.wav	2.73	It's not just going to be busy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_401.wav	3.38	She was on the edge of breaking point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_402.wav	3.29	The first appeared to be successful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_403.wav	2.31	She was so supportive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_404.wav	2.73	I'm delighted with our performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_405.wav	2.65	We await a decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_406.wav	2.65	It's a matter of balance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_407.wav	3.46	It is an investment in our product.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_408.wav	2.82	Everyone can have their opinion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_409.wav	2.39	What would you ask?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_410.wav	2.48	We have got to deal with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_411.wav	2.73	Where do we spend it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_412.wav	2.69	I don't know how she does it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_413.wav	3.16	I saw it later in the news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_414.wav	3.38	Now we must look to the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_415.wav	2.52	I didn't play badly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_416.wav	3.07	We haven't come out of this very well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_417.wav	2.39	They are looking for partners.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_418.wav	2.99	I thought they could have made the gesture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_419.wav	2.65	We should have been rewarded for producing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_420.wav	3.72	I am also delighted for all the players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_421.wav	3.25	He did very well, but didn't win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_422.wav	3.03	There is no shortage of questions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_423.wav	3.67	Couldn't see the point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p339\p339_424.wav	4.70	Which, in effect, it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_001.wav	2.01	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_002.wav	3.85	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_003.wav	6.45	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_004.wav	4.53	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_005.wav	5.29	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_006.wav	6.44	When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_007.wav	4.06	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_008.wav	7.64	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_009.wav	5.21	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_010.wav	2.91	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_011.wav	6.53	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_012.wav	4.48	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_013.wav	4.23	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_014.wav	4.48	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_015.wav	4.83	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_016.wav	6.02	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_017.wav	3.46	Others have tried to explain this phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_018.wav	5.29	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_019.wav	6.58	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_020.wav	4.35	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_021.wav	8.06	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_022.wav	5.85	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_024.wav	5.90	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_025.wav	2.09	It would be nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_026.wav	2.90	We are not prepared to do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_027.wav	2.86	We've just decided to do something about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_028.wav	2.61	It's a horrific incident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_029.wav	2.44	But it's not just about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_030.wav	2.69	We've not won anything yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_031.wav	2.22	He was very close.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_032.wav	2.14	But someone has to take them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_033.wav	2.90	We don't find any danger from them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_034.wav	2.69	Do you think they would do any better?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_035.wav	2.26	They were appalling, disgraceful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_036.wav	1.80	Who was that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_037.wav	3.59	There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_038.wav	2.48	This is my personal assessment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_039.wav	2.35	It is a recipe for success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_040.wav	2.60	You've got to have everything inside with you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_041.wav	2.05	We didn't deserve to win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_042.wav	2.01	This is great news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_043.wav	2.31	We can hardly talk about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_044.wav	2.01	That was a month ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_045.wav	2.82	I have lost all confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_046.wav	2.52	It would be another reason to live.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_047.wav	2.35	I felt under a lot of pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_048.wav	2.78	None of the pieces was commissioned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_049.wav	2.22	It is somewhere to be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_050.wav	1.75	But it was no problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_051.wav	2.52	This has been a difficult time for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_052.wav	2.52	These people are not big names.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_053.wav	2.01	Don't you believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_054.wav	2.95	I certainly think it's very short-sighted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_055.wav	1.97	We did something about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_056.wav	2.30	Where is the money coming from?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_057.wav	2.01	It needs a rethink.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_058.wav	1.75	Why does it work?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_059.wav	1.97	He would have been wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_060.wav	2.05	He played really, really well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_061.wav	1.84	He was right of course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_062.wav	2.48	It's there for people to look at.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_063.wav	3.76	Together, we can make a difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_064.wav	2.39	That, however, was the exception.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_065.wav	2.56	This has been a long process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_066.wav	2.27	It's a lovely, lovely film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_067.wav	2.26	It's probably just as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_068.wav	2.73	It is time for the talking to stop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_069.wav	1.97	We were very close.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_070.wav	2.05	If only it were so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_071.wav	2.05	They do not deliver.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_072.wav	2.60	However, that is just for starters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_073.wav	2.09	This can be extreme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_074.wav	2.26	I'm sure that they will learn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_075.wav	2.26	Would she remember the music?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_076.wav	3.67	There was still more disquiet in Israel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_077.wav	2.39	Two options are being proposed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_078.wav	3.16	Mr Masterton said he was very hopeful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_079.wav	2.09	He is now back in Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_080.wav	2.48	There was no commission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_081.wav	2.18	There was a vacuum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_082.wav	2.52	It is time to be realistic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_083.wav	2.39	Everyone in front of me was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_084.wav	3.21	Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_085.wav	2.48	It is a potential danger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_086.wav	2.73	I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_087.wav	3.72	But we never wanted to do that here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_088.wav	2.56	There was no hint of scandal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_089.wav	2.69	The money will go straight to the headteacher.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_090.wav	2.78	He said, we're delighted by the vote.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_091.wav	3.20	It could be to do with the location.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_092.wav	2.35	This is a terrible tragedy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_093.wav	2.52	The teenager had been missing for six months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_094.wav	2.44	I'm delighted to be coming back home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_095.wav	2.01	He said he never saw it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_096.wav	2.26	It is a matter of clarity.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_097.wav	2.14	You will never get a conviction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_098.wav	2.31	He did not have to stop and think.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_099.wav	1.88	We deserved to win it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_100.wav	1.79	Or did it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_101.wav	1.67	It's just not funny!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_102.wav	4.44	His own excitement is never difficult to detect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_103.wav	2.69	He almost admitted as much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_104.wav	2.78	So what is the problem?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_105.wav	3.46	We believe it to be completely without merit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_106.wav	2.48	He didn't bother a soul.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_107.wav	2.69	That was my first reaction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_108.wav	2.78	Fishing is a declining industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_109.wav	2.73	Another man said, It was horrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_110.wav	2.18	That's the way it goes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_111.wav	3.97	But we still don't know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_112.wav	2.95	Are there any he wants to play?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_113.wav	2.78	The film is on a tightrope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_114.wav	2.86	It was a question of patience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_115.wav	2.91	I have never been in anything like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_116.wav	2.52	I have done ever since it was published.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_117.wav	2.61	We have got to the top.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_118.wav	2.56	In fact, they have the opposite effect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_119.wav	2.61	And it worked, so we kept it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_120.wav	2.86	The king is delighted by the honour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_121.wav	3.12	Johnsen is equally concerned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_122.wav	3.42	My body is clearly capable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_123.wav	1.92	Yes, we can beat them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_124.wav	2.82	She was not hard done by.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_125.wav	2.65	They said they were only young men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_126.wav	2.35	We are in the end game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_127.wav	2.05	This is not the case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_128.wav	2.82	There may be some resistance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_129.wav	2.82	It is the same old story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_130.wav	2.09	You need that freedom in society.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_131.wav	2.14	It is a strong case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_132.wav	2.44	Who do you think will win?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_133.wav	3.25	I certainly would not accept this decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_134.wav	2.65	That was one very hard game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_135.wav	2.69	He said something in his work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_136.wav	2.22	I recommend a tour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_137.wav	2.56	This research is extremely promising.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_138.wav	2.60	I was invited to work in Germany.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_139.wav	3.80	Weather conditions were good, he added.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_140.wav	3.41	Don't hold your breath.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_141.wav	3.37	He was shaking like a leaf.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_142.wav	2.35	I have a moral dilemma.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_143.wav	2.22	It looks like a hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_144.wav	2.01	How did he know?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_145.wav	2.56	He will have to live with his words.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_146.wav	3.63	Openness is always the best way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_147.wav	3.63	It added to the spectacle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_148.wav	2.78	They are working very well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_149.wav	2.65	And he listens to his artists as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_150.wav	2.99	He is advised that he has done so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_151.wav	2.52	Annika is very, very fit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_152.wav	2.30	This is not quite right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_153.wav	1.52	It really is tremendous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_154.wav	2.61	I've never regretted my decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_155.wav	2.82	This is a recipe for disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_156.wav	2.56	The wind was coming from all directions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_157.wav	2.27	So we started building a home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_158.wav	2.31	He was as good as his word.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_159.wav	2.52	It will not happen overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_160.wav	2.01	Surely it can't get any worse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_161.wav	1.67	He has to learn.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_162.wav	1.97	He, too, will return.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_163.wav	2.05	What then is wrong?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_164.wav	2.26	My brother is not like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_165.wav	2.09	He was very fit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_166.wav	1.92	It was very exciting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_167.wav	2.52	It is clear that change is required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_168.wav	1.88	They did a very good job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_169.wav	2.26	It has been a waste of time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_170.wav	3.03	As far as we're concerned, the matter is closed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_171.wav	2.94	He had no previous convictions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_172.wav	2.35	It is no more than a shell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_173.wav	2.10	And did they have sex?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_174.wav	2.39	But he was a really nice man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_175.wav	2.43	It was very close.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_176.wav	1.92	It should be scrapped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_177.wav	1.71	It gives us hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_178.wav	2.52	We can't determine that clearly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_179.wav	2.35	They are just trying to cover up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_180.wav	2.14	Are you the man from The Herald?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_181.wav	1.75	And that's it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_182.wav	2.65	I came here this week to work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_183.wav	2.09	We are really good friends.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_184.wav	2.31	But that is not an issue for now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_185.wav	2.56	Of course the ending was fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_186.wav	1.88	I want to be frank.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_187.wav	2.26	This was an option from the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_188.wav	2.39	Clearly he is keeping in touch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_189.wav	2.26	Yet it seemed to work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_190.wav	2.61	I think it was just a tragic accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_191.wav	3.46	We haven't been able to go and see.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_192.wav	1.79	It works, as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_193.wav	1.84	I can't say anything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_194.wav	2.47	I would be interested in another attempt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_195.wav	2.95	However, that is a sizeable if.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_196.wav	1.84	There is no other way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_197.wav	2.05	This was all well and good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_198.wav	2.18	This is a disaster for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_199.wav	2.01	What does that mean?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_200.wav	2.01	This is your life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_201.wav	2.14	He has seen the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_202.wav	1.88	He can be beaten.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_203.wav	3.16	He had been on holiday visiting his grandmother.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_204.wav	1.97	Why does he do it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_205.wav	2.18	That's my daughter acting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_206.wav	2.69	They are very clever and very dangerous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_207.wav	2.22	It wouldn't matter if he had.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_208.wav	2.18	We lost out a little bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_209.wav	2.56	Hollywood comedy is having a good week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_210.wav	3.33	I had just taken it off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_211.wav	2.35	The family baton is handed on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_212.wav	4.19	We have to put pressure on Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_213.wav	2.82	It was properly reported to us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_214.wav	3.76	He was outstanding today - the best player on the park.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_215.wav	2.39	The seller was not revealed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_216.wav	2.22	Everything happened so quickly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_217.wav	1.75	How can this be?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_218.wav	2.52	I am feeling a bit better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_219.wav	2.13	Everyone here is heartbroken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_220.wav	2.39	Not so, it seems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_221.wav	2.13	He was also a great man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_222.wav	2.43	We have no further comment to make.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_223.wav	2.95	This produces exactly the opposite effect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_224.wav	2.65	Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_225.wav	2.52	You have to keep it on the fairways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_226.wav	2.91	Sub Not Used, McCormick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_227.wav	2.05	So there, we won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_228.wav	1.92	I don't like to fail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_229.wav	2.13	I really didn't think he would.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_230.wav	2.39	He may have a long wait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_231.wav	2.52	They have already done that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_232.wav	2.78	Later, a very different story emerged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_233.wav	1.58	So it should be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_234.wav	2.39	They didn't find any substance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_235.wav	1.58	It's hard to say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_236.wav	2.05	Her heart was not in it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_237.wav	2.60	After all, he is the King of Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_238.wav	2.43	Is there any prospect of this happening?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_239.wav	2.14	They are now collapsing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_240.wav	2.94	He had been surprised by the local reaction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_241.wav	2.43	Government funding is not a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_242.wav	2.73	I'm still an amateur in that sense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_243.wav	2.22	We just did not want to believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_244.wav	2.73	The medal itself is not that important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_245.wav	2.39	I should think so, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_246.wav	2.35	The time for change is now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_247.wav	2.52	They deserved to beat us in the replay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_248.wav	2.18	Can they be serious?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_249.wav	2.48	We've got to get this right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_250.wav	1.88	The film was great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_251.wav	2.65	I'm just enjoying every match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_252.wav	2.44	They set up to win the hole.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_253.wav	2.26	I am not a liar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_254.wav	3.63	Let's make this clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_255.wav	2.39	We also hope to meet the men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_256.wav	2.65	It was quite simply, delicious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_257.wav	2.14	I can't believe it happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_258.wav	2.35	Thankfully it was cleared up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_259.wav	2.48	The game will be at a football stadium.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_260.wav	2.01	They were his words.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_261.wav	2.56	Shelter also supports the reform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_262.wav	2.47	The attack was totally out of the blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_263.wav	2.14	People were very confused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_264.wav	2.35	We've had a lot of adjusting to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_265.wav	1.92	I am very relieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_266.wav	2.31	The people have been really friendly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_267.wav	2.78	It was bound to happen, and it has happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_268.wav	2.65	Aberdeen were difficult to break down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_269.wav	2.52	That, though, is not true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_270.wav	2.05	I hope he comes back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_271.wav	2.35	They made up for it on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_272.wav	1.88	That was our mission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_273.wav	1.88	I am delighted for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_274.wav	2.52	The second half was a different affair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_275.wav	2.82	The scheme has been funded by the Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_276.wav	2.91	They might be surprised by the response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_277.wav	1.75	I've done it all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_278.wav	2.69	We have worked well with them for years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_279.wav	2.39	They've had a good start as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_280.wav	2.14	The director's a genius.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_281.wav	1.84	One thing is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_282.wav	2.39	We might never see him again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_283.wav	2.05	Such as it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_284.wav	1.92	The car was just there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_285.wav	2.22	They were very unfair to him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_286.wav	2.13	I have spoken to my brother.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_287.wav	2.39	And that is very good indeed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_288.wav	2.44	We could have had no new money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_289.wav	2.35	It wasn't an easy decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_290.wav	2.18	It wasn't really like that at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_291.wav	2.09	What will happen to them now?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_292.wav	2.10	It is set in Paris.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_293.wav	2.44	The Dream is as hard as they come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_294.wav	1.88	We are not collecting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_295.wav	2.52	It shows the right amount of progress.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_296.wav	2.22	I thought the dancing was over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_297.wav	2.56	I think they have got it completely right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_298.wav	2.69	This is excellent news for Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_299.wav	2.26	He's already made history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_300.wav	2.48	Police have appealed for witnesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_301.wav	1.92	There is a lot of fear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_302.wav	1.75	They are not left wing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_303.wav	2.14	I've heard it all before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_304.wav	1.67	We are not there yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_305.wav	2.14	We will not give up on the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_306.wav	2.31	Sub Not Used, McCall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_307.wav	1.75	Now they had it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_308.wav	2.14	She died a few days later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_309.wav	2.01	What is their concern?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_310.wav	2.09	The difference was amazing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_311.wav	1.96	That is why we are here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_312.wav	2.01	But it is historic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_313.wav	1.79	You have to feel for the guy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_314.wav	2.65	I have still to hear about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_315.wav	2.10	I'm going to win the next two.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_316.wav	2.39	You know it was good fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_317.wav	2.31	They want that school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_318.wav	2.22	They have not changed at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_319.wav	2.86	One is investment, one is reform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_320.wav	2.99	The last few weeks have been really bad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_321.wav	3.12	Structural changes will never be enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_322.wav	2.48	I am extremely cautious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_323.wav	2.90	That was always the danger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_324.wav	2.14	Will they fall in love?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_325.wav	2.82	There was nothing sinister in that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_326.wav	2.52	But don't just take my word for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_327.wav	2.13	Is that what it's about?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_328.wav	2.52	And the audience is a surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_329.wav	2.35	They worked on it for three hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_330.wav	1.80	Let's make him a show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_331.wav	2.44	I'd never heard anything like it before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_332.wav	2.56	People are using it in their daily lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_333.wav	2.01	It seemed so personal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_334.wav	2.82	Would that be for men and women?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_335.wav	2.18	The government agreed to pay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_336.wav	2.52	I think we have got the balance right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_337.wav	2.78	It was a very terrible thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_338.wav	2.39	Let's not take too much for granted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_339.wav	2.90	It has been an extremely long haul.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_340.wav	2.65	I'll need to discuss it with my family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_341.wav	2.90	She is deeply distressed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_342.wav	2.30	They should have listened to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_343.wav	2.90	Well, there can be no complaints about this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_344.wav	1.84	They said they would.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_345.wav	1.96	When will this change?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_346.wav	2.18	You know the score.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_347.wav	2.69	It was like someone had died.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_348.wav	2.14	I am an innocent man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_349.wav	2.86	The improvement today was fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_350.wav	2.27	He has been under great pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_351.wav	2.39	I'm looking forward to coming home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_352.wav	3.46	She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_353.wav	3.03	Our Great Depression is our lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_354.wav	2.82	He was elected as a councillor last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_355.wav	2.86	I just did not cope with the pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_356.wav	2.01	But he did not appear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_357.wav	2.56	So he was anxious to try something new.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_358.wav	2.18	The time was right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_359.wav	2.18	It all happened so quickly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_360.wav	2.39	It is working well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_361.wav	2.26	They really want to do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_362.wav	2.60	He said nothing of the sort.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_363.wav	2.61	Governments will have to respond.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_364.wav	2.27	It simply doesn't happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_365.wav	2.99	We wanted to do something different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_366.wav	2.90	The past is history, not destiny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_367.wav	1.92	I love it here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_368.wav	2.48	Things are on track.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_369.wav	2.61	Frankly it was disgusting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_370.wav	2.31	It is a tragedy for the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_371.wav	3.72	He was not entirely correct.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_372.wav	2.90	I'm sorry if any offence has been caused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_373.wav	2.30	War is not the action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_374.wav	2.18	There are not enough of them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_375.wav	2.35	It has been a frustrating one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_376.wav	3.12	Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_377.wav	2.69	But we wouldn't want them any other way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_378.wav	2.27	What's in a name?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_379.wav	2.39	It feels like a winner already.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_380.wav	2.77	They are expected to be released today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_381.wav	3.03	There was no question of him not impressing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_382.wav	2.05	We were all afraid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_383.wav	2.05	I hadn't had that before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_384.wav	2.22	We have a plan in place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_385.wav	2.43	That is to miss the point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_386.wav	2.82	It will be a new experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_387.wav	1.75	I didn't see it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_388.wav	3.03	Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_389.wav	1.71	IT had to happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_390.wav	2.35	It is a challenge for all of us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_391.wav	2.01	The children are fine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_392.wav	2.05	I don't believe in God.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_393.wav	1.88	There's also the point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_394.wav	2.18	It's good to be back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_395.wav	2.31	It wasn't the second one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_396.wav	1.67	He got his degree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_397.wav	2.05	And rugby fans can help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_398.wav	2.65	Detectives are still working on the case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_399.wav	2.57	I reported it but nothing was done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_400.wav	2.01	They were not defeated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_401.wav	2.65	There was much to be positive about.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_402.wav	2.18	It wants them to go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_403.wav	2.05	I had a ball today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_404.wav	2.69	Yet the improvement in behaviour was huge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_405.wav	2.56	He said no survivors had been found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_406.wav	2.43	It is the end of an era.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_407.wav	1.84	We shall not do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_408.wav	2.78	My daughter was really, really innocent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_409.wav	2.09	It will not be easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_410.wav	2.39	Once again, he refused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_411.wav	2.09	And it will be a challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_412.wav	2.18	And Scotland is no different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_413.wav	2.44	The power of religion is so strong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_414.wav	1.84	It means a huge amount.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_415.wav	3.12	There are two interests in this woodland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_416.wav	2.05	I was frustrated here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_417.wav	1.97	It is a good result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_418.wav	1.92	Are you watching Liverpool?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_419.wav	2.69	I'll never think of myself as a star.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_420.wav	1.96	It was one New Year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_421.wav	2.35	We made a world record together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_422.wav	2.44	Our policy is already working well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_423.wav	2.14	I believe we have a good chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p340\p340_424.wav	2.44	Things were not easy from the outset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_001.wav	2.73	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_002.wav	5.80	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_003.wav	9.09	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_004.wav	6.70	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_005.wav	7.85	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_006.wav	8.66	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_007.wav	5.98	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_008.wav	9.94	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_009.wav	6.49	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_010.wav	5.33	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_011.wav	9.01	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_012.wav	6.40	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_013.wav	5.77	Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_014.wav	7.00	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_015.wav	7.77	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_016.wav	8.58	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_017.wav	5.38	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_018.wav	7.64	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_019.wav	10.07	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_020.wav	5.16	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_021.wav	12.16	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_022.wav	8.84	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_023.wav	14.76	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_024.wav	9.69	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_025.wav	4.10	This guy is never going to give up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_026.wav	3.33	That's interesting to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_027.wav	4.91	I managed to take her completely by surprise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_028.wav	4.23	It is only one night, after all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_029.wav	4.10	The injuries are not too serious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_030.wav	3.67	Gilbert was not amused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_031.wav	5.72	I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_032.wav	4.95	It has moved on in the last week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_033.wav	3.63	Everything was up for grabs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_034.wav	3.42	It's easy to see why.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_035.wav	3.55	I am proud of moments like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_036.wav	3.33	That was no surprise to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_037.wav	4.91	This has been blown out of all proportion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_038.wav	3.33	There is no escape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_039.wav	3.67	It's wonderful to have won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_040.wav	4.27	Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_041.wav	4.40	He was arrested, but later released without charge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_042.wav	4.10	I fell into it by accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_043.wav	5.04	Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_044.wav	2.86	This is a big advantage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_045.wav	3.33	Her daughter is getting married.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_046.wav	4.87	Moray Council could not be contacted last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_047.wav	4.86	If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_048.wav	4.65	All the lads are totally focused on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_049.wav	3.80	Today is not about contracts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_050.wav	4.74	That says something for his strength of character.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_051.wav	3.20	We are going for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_052.wav	4.40	You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_053.wav	3.50	It's to do with play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_054.wav	5.12	However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_055.wav	2.77	I've just got to do this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_056.wav	4.31	It's not, of course, a concert hall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_057.wav	3.71	So the process was refined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_058.wav	3.97	Labour accused the Tory leader of panicking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_059.wav	4.69	I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_060.wav	4.99	I think it is a sensible change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_061.wav	3.97	Sex is fun?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_062.wav	4.57	They were not doing it too well, either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_063.wav	4.74	He added, It's not a racial problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_064.wav	3.97	This is the crossroads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_065.wav	3.29	He had played well in that central role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_066.wav	2.82	He is pretty upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_067.wav	3.25	And who would argue with that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_068.wav	3.46	Where is the human rights?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_069.wav	3.63	We must put a marker down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_070.wav	4.10	The decision is an absolute disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_071.wav	5.51	Now, just two games into the season, he has gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_072.wav	3.80	It is time to give her a rest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_073.wav	5.12	They had had time for little else.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_074.wav	3.33	The feeling is awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_075.wav	4.65	We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_076.wav	3.42	But there was a shift.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_077.wav	3.93	The settlement could run to millions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_078.wav	3.84	It does not stop at the border.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_079.wav	5.46	We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_080.wav	5.08	He released a half-dozen solo albums.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_081.wav	4.31	Robert is a special talent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_082.wav	6.87	John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_083.wav	5.04	In the meantime, he added, prevention was the key.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_084.wav	4.95	They are going to carry it through.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_085.wav	3.93	She added, It is a huge problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_086.wav	3.42	You can't keep them separate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_087.wav	4.06	The composer therefore believes he can do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_088.wav	3.76	I still feel like a wee boy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_089.wav	4.78	He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_090.wav	4.65	The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_091.wav	3.80	It had a gigantic effect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_092.wav	4.14	Israel has done very little until now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_093.wav	4.01	Debate was impassioned and furious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_094.wav	2.73	We are losing this war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_095.wav	3.20	It's a difficult one to play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_096.wav	3.89	The death rates are still as high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_097.wav	3.63	We are seeing a Government in a hurry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_098.wav	4.06	It is a great honour and a privilege.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_099.wav	4.14	We certainly will need to watch him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_100.wav	3.63	I don't think it could be clearer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_101.wav	5.98	That meant the search was unlawful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_102.wav	4.10	He put some colour into Scottish history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_103.wav	3.97	People buy everything with cash.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_104.wav	3.67	We are trying to establish a date.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_105.wav	4.10	He is a law unto himself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_106.wav	3.97	The website is now being amended.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_107.wav	4.31	There was great support all round the route.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_108.wav	3.03	I was a bit nervous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_109.wav	3.71	It was a bit of a struggle today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_110.wav	4.40	It was love of Helen and the children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_111.wav	4.57	If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_112.wav	3.42	I love this tournament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_113.wav	4.57	This is thought to mean sometime next week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_114.wav	3.63	He had a heart problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_115.wav	4.53	The breakdown was much later in her life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_116.wav	5.12	I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_117.wav	4.27	Both managements are very supportive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_118.wav	4.52	Whoever said that cannot have seen it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_119.wav	4.57	He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_120.wav	4.19	The choice is strictly personal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_121.wav	3.89	We are going to go about our lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_122.wav	4.35	He had other things on his mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_123.wav	3.84	The lady is right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_124.wav	4.31	I hadn't seen them in eight years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_125.wav	4.65	Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_126.wav	3.29	The next few months will tell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_127.wav	3.20	I'm so proud of my team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_128.wav	3.33	It is crucial for both teams.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_129.wav	4.70	It ended as it began, in confusion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_130.wav	4.27	I am now just a bit uneasy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_131.wav	2.95	You can see their point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_132.wav	5.42	Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_133.wav	4.23	There was no hint of bravado.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_134.wav	5.29	However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_135.wav	3.89	Yet he chose to do something different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_136.wav	5.21	He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_137.wav	5.85	At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_138.wav	4.23	There were no casualties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_139.wav	3.38	The case will now go to appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_140.wav	3.16	They really did a great job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_141.wav	4.31	A teacher is, really, about unity.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_142.wav	4.70	They are still going to be impulsive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_143.wav	3.54	I love you so very much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_144.wav	3.12	He is a very nice man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_145.wav	3.88	The road was closed for several hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_146.wav	4.65	Their condition was described as stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_147.wav	3.93	There's a good chance of seeing something.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_148.wav	5.42	In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_149.wav	3.71	I had a tie in my hand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_150.wav	4.40	Surrey police said no body had been found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_151.wav	5.08	Sean Connery did not disappoint.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_152.wav	5.59	Such a city does not exist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_153.wav	3.67	My aim is a top six finish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_154.wav	4.23	He came in an army uniform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_155.wav	4.78	We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_156.wav	3.97	It was to no avail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_157.wav	4.40	Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_158.wav	5.51	But my heart is in athletics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_159.wav	5.25	That is in the very nature of farming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_160.wav	4.61	You shouldn't have a stoppage in November.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_161.wav	4.36	These matters are now behind us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_162.wav	3.38	I'm working on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_163.wav	4.44	I love the tradition of vaudeville.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_164.wav	3.76	It was then into overtime.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_165.wav	4.70	Most of the public are behind me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_166.wav	4.53	The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_167.wav	4.14	It really is a gift to the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_168.wav	4.35	Look at his last couple of records.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_169.wav	4.48	I am still very much a director.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_170.wav	4.78	We must not give in to bastards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_171.wav	4.91	She may even appear in some more films.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_172.wav	5.42	In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_173.wav	4.40	My house was shaking at the time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_174.wav	4.57	They will know they deserve to be there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_175.wav	2.99	Of course he is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_176.wav	4.57	This is a very positive step forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_177.wav	3.67	This is a huge confidence boost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_178.wav	4.18	They recorded their debut album in New York.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_179.wav	2.77	And does it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_180.wav	4.57	The crackdown is launched today by the government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_181.wav	3.80	That's how it worked in Bosnia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_182.wav	3.41	Nobody ever knew it had happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_183.wav	4.53	She is a very lucky lady.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_184.wav	3.16	It's the whole season.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_185.wav	4.01	We've been there for seven years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_186.wav	4.01	Promises were not kept.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_187.wav	3.80	His signature is his handwriting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_188.wav	5.12	He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_189.wav	3.12	I've already done that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_190.wav	3.80	We are on the path of change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_191.wav	3.76	You can feel at home in China.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_192.wav	3.07	Who is he?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_193.wav	4.52	It has to be a long-term commitment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_194.wav	4.78	No such remedy has ever been pursued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_195.wav	3.41	Felt good about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_196.wav	5.25	It also highlighted some local hero districts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_197.wav	4.78	The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_198.wav	4.83	Why does she suddenly win everything now?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_199.wav	2.52	What's the big idea?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_200.wav	4.10	One season, they might do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_201.wav	4.14	It's fun and challenging, but it is not easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_202.wav	6.27	NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_203.wav	5.46	Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_204.wav	3.80	It's up to their parents to choose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_205.wav	4.87	I feel privileged to be here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_206.wav	4.95	If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_207.wav	4.57	She told me to apply for the crest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_208.wav	3.89	Too much has already been said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_209.wav	5.33	John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_210.wav	4.31	He explained to his audience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_211.wav	3.93	I think the Government should pay for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_212.wav	3.76	I asked why he had come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_213.wav	2.90	He was a soldier.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_214.wav	3.55	The budget was too low for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_215.wav	4.19	All inquiries should be made to the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_216.wav	2.99	It didn't get any better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_217.wav	2.86	I'm a bit annoyed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_218.wav	3.50	He doesn't like the Labour Party.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_219.wav	3.93	I am totally devoted to this job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_220.wav	3.08	I just could not cope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_221.wav	3.93	He asked me in a tolerance zone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_222.wav	3.88	It is all one-sided.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_223.wav	3.76	I've been thinking about it for a year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_224.wav	5.46	Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_225.wav	3.93	Here are some possible solutions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_226.wav	3.03	That's the day job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_227.wav	4.53	Glasgow is going to be open for business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_228.wav	3.72	IT was a thoroughly modern affair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_229.wav	3.63	I'm not saying he is finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_230.wav	4.06	That probably wouldn't happen at Liverpool.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_231.wav	3.67	He is well respected by his colleagues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_232.wav	5.21	It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_233.wav	4.95	Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_234.wav	3.67	I would have dropped out otherwise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_236.wav	5.12	Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_237.wav	4.31	Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_238.wav	3.50	We believe we have a strong case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_239.wav	3.37	I lost it at the final whistle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_240.wav	3.37	Bill is a mentor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_241.wav	4.57	They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_242.wav	4.35	I think he has undergone a sea change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_243.wav	3.12	One must hope not!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_244.wav	2.69	It was a big day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_245.wav	3.46	What makes a house a home?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_246.wav	4.36	I think however, he was having a fit!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_247.wav	4.06	I live on the streets of Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_248.wav	3.16	I will not be pressured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_249.wav	2.99	It doesn't make sense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_250.wav	3.89	I'll go back home and see my family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_251.wav	4.60	He admitted the asylum system was not working.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_252.wav	3.93	Have we not had the rainy season already?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_253.wav	4.27	I have heard the stories from Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_254.wav	4.91	Sub Not Used, McKay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_255.wav	3.80	Do not listen to them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_256.wav	3.29	Mind you, who wouldn't?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_257.wav	4.61	That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_258.wav	3.37	He loves the big occasions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_259.wav	3.37	Our system is archaic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_260.wav	3.33	It was a tactical change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_261.wav	3.71	That's what it's all about, isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_262.wav	5.21	When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_263.wav	4.31	This time, there were no such rewards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_264.wav	4.01	He said Mr Holland was a disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_265.wav	3.76	I gave him a way out, and he took it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_266.wav	4.86	Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_267.wav	3.03	She became very good at it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_268.wav	3.76	We don't have the credible evidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_269.wav	3.50	It's one up to the Scots.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_270.wav	4.01	I'm just doing artwork.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_271.wav	3.54	And we still have to pay his salary.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_272.wav	2.99	Also, he was flawed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_273.wav	4.06	Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_274.wav	2.90	So there's a double whammy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_275.wav	3.03	I didn't have a trio.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_276.wav	5.12	Their three other children had died as infants.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_277.wav	4.01	That is a mark of what you are.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_278.wav	4.31	His wife Margaret was not in court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_279.wav	4.06	Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_280.wav	3.88	I hope my successor will do the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_281.wav	3.08	The manager knew me very well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_282.wav	3.84	I have been totally taken aback by this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_283.wav	3.12	Are you in this movie?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_284.wav	3.50	We've got a full house tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_285.wav	4.44	If they don't, they won't get what they want.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_286.wav	3.59	The fans will support us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_287.wav	2.65	Make sure you see it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_288.wav	4.14	It has, however, been a long time coming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_289.wav	3.88	We are aware of the two incidents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_290.wav	4.57	We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_291.wav	4.01	It was just one of those things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_292.wav	3.08	The whole team was rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_293.wav	3.29	Now we need to keep our heads up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_294.wav	4.23	You've got it coming Kabul.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_295.wav	3.97	They must act now to tighten the rules.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_296.wav	4.18	They too refused to come out and talk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_297.wav	3.84	But, mainly, it is up to ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_298.wav	4.14	It's the curse of our time, irony.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_299.wav	3.16	That was enough for the committee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_300.wav	3.20	It's a source of deep concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_301.wav	4.65	Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_302.wav	3.84	But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_303.wav	4.87	Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_304.wav	5.51	It is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_305.wav	4.57	However, there are also many areas of agreement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_306.wav	3.84	Last month he made his debut in Japan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_307.wav	3.33	The Dow Jones is way up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_308.wav	3.50	We have to adapt to this level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_309.wav	3.67	They were the better side on the day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_310.wav	3.89	What are you going to do exactly?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_311.wav	3.84	We have lost the round, but not the fight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_312.wav	2.99	There is nothing like a fresh start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_313.wav	3.42	Calderwood would agree with that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_314.wav	3.12	No-one thought about this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_315.wav	3.25	We're all in a state of shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_316.wav	3.50	I thought he was part of the camera.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_317.wav	3.80	You will never forget the clutching horror.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_318.wav	4.36	Farmers have been an endangered species.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_319.wav	2.91	This is very bad news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_320.wav	3.59	He was released in March this year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_321.wav	6.40	No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_322.wav	3.46	I stayed away from the defence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_323.wav	4.40	We do need to get the message across.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_324.wav	3.33	Instead, she just went away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_325.wav	3.93	That did not go down well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_326.wav	4.57	The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_327.wav	3.97	It was chaotic and frightening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_328.wav	3.80	It is a question of balance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_329.wav	4.23	Soon the whole country will be level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_330.wav	4.23	And huge, indeed, it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_331.wav	3.89	Tax is a matter for national governments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_332.wav	4.61	I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_333.wav	3.93	Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_334.wav	6.11	For his opposite number, this was just triumph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_335.wav	4.78	He said he needed no more evidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_336.wav	4.27	People might not actually want the job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_337.wav	5.98	It is the logical extension of audio description.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_338.wav	3.16	It broke up my marriage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_339.wav	3.50	They told us about it the next day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_340.wav	4.61	Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_341.wav	3.25	If there is default.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_342.wav	3.42	We are very nearly there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_343.wav	3.42	He also was in debt to drug dealers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_344.wav	2.86	We have to go for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_345.wav	4.18	I'm surprised that it has taken this approach.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_346.wav	3.50	Barry will be able to handle this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_347.wav	4.14	This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_348.wav	2.78	The urgency is real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_349.wav	2.82	I've already got them in.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_350.wav	3.63	He takes time out for everyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_351.wav	4.57	The science is well known, the solution is simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_352.wav	4.87	They are just bewildered and very concerned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_353.wav	3.12	I can't stop people thinking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_354.wav	3.88	The workers said they were treated like animals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_355.wav	4.05	I have not been so angry for years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_356.wav	4.01	She had every right to read the warrant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_357.wav	3.08	This is normal for him now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_358.wav	3.12	Nothing was going to go right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_359.wav	3.33	There is too much at stake for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_360.wav	3.54	Nobody ever gets to see them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_361.wav	3.29	That's an old idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_362.wav	3.25	Scotland is losing business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_363.wav	3.59	The place became a war zone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_364.wav	2.90	What's happening to her?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_365.wav	3.97	It was to get even better for Motherwell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_366.wav	5.34	Both parties can win, and Scotland can win as a result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_367.wav	4.82	The surprise is its product is so poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_368.wav	3.08	I don't have a new house.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_369.wav	4.57	It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_370.wav	4.14	Thus the story will continue to thrive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_371.wav	2.78	You are a liar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_372.wav	4.61	Her advice for Glasgow is just be visionary.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_373.wav	5.42	He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_374.wav	3.03	See it while you can.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_375.wav	3.67	Folk music is in her blood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_376.wav	3.71	And we all understand that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_377.wav	3.33	One policeman was killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_378.wav	2.99	And it's not funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_379.wav	3.84	I didn't do too badly myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_380.wav	2.73	We cannot lose it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_381.wav	3.59	They have learned from that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_382.wav	4.14	We have been working together for some years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_383.wav	3.84	Chris Paterson is a class act.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_384.wav	3.63	We only lost the third goal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_385.wav	4.61	And that's the question for the Chamber.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_386.wav	3.97	That gave us some confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_387.wav	3.80	No-one has yet been charged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_388.wav	4.57	Such people do not exist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_389.wav	3.59	Is this new report the answer?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_390.wav	3.59	Then came the second round.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_391.wav	4.87	It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_392.wav	3.16	There was someone on the floor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_393.wav	4.61	Story time is over - it's a war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_394.wav	2.78	Maybe, who knows?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_395.wav	4.06	However, this idea is never developed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_396.wav	3.38	But it is all by design.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_397.wav	2.69	It was a sell-out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_398.wav	3.20	We've still got a say in this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_399.wav	2.65	Things are going very well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_400.wav	4.40	She can't say where she was, what she did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_401.wav	3.76	I'll take what comes along.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_402.wav	3.93	Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_403.wav	4.44	She will just have wanted her baby.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_404.wav	4.44	Golf has lost a great character.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_405.wav	3.88	You have to have some hope and faith.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_406.wav	3.63	They hold on for many years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_407.wav	3.89	However, the report was incorrect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_408.wav	4.01	Women reported more depression than men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_409.wav	2.73	He needs to be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p341\p341_410.wav	4.40	The euro is your money, it is our money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_001.wav	2.86	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_002.wav	4.05	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_003.wav	8.48	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_004.wav	5.76	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_005.wav	7.00	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_006.wav	6.32	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_007.wav	5.50	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_009.wav	5.98	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_010.wav	3.63	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_011.wav	7.51	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_012.wav	4.91	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_013.wav	4.78	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_014.wav	5.38	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_015.wav	7.60	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_016.wav	9.22	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_018.wav	7.21	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_019.wav	7.21	Since the physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_020.wav	5.29	Many contemplated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_021.wav	10.07	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_022.wav	7.30	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_023.wav	13.02	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_024.wav	7.93	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_025.wav	2.82	I've got a long way to go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_026.wav	2.65	I'll go to the races.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_027.wav	3.29	We will be back next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_028.wav	4.19	I was very, very pleased with our display.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_029.wav	2.69	It is a crucial award.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_030.wav	3.88	People don't feel safe, including me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_031.wav	3.97	Survival is our aim.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_032.wav	2.94	But it might have done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_033.wav	3.50	Nor is it likely to do so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_034.wav	2.73	What can you do?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_035.wav	3.37	I read it every year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_036.wav	2.56	I go in for the parts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_037.wav	3.54	It should be the reverse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_038.wav	3.88	We are a team of hard workers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_039.wav	3.42	It is up to Ann.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_040.wav	2.91	And you know something?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_041.wav	3.46	We were with him the whole time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_042.wav	3.84	That was the theory, anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_043.wav	3.33	We've all been here before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_044.wav	3.37	I had troubles with the producers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_045.wav	3.50	So, it took me back to boarding school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_046.wav	3.12	He died the following year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_047.wav	2.56	That's what we're trying to achieve.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_048.wav	3.24	He is trying really hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_049.wav	3.33	I have no doubt about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_050.wav	4.27	It is a beautiful country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_051.wav	3.12	I expect a rapid response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_052.wav	3.97	There was still more disquiet in Israel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_053.wav	3.29	This was never a support group.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_054.wav	2.82	I must take a seat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_055.wav	2.84	My mother is a widow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_056.wav	4.02	Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_057.wav	4.06	Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_058.wav	3.20	The matter will come up again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_059.wav	3.76	I don't believe in gesture politics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_060.wav	3.84	The decision is purely down to the clinic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_061.wav	3.33	He should be a great asset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_062.wav	3.67	But that's another story for another day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_063.wav	2.61	One thing is sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_064.wav	2.41	He has really done well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_065.wav	3.24	I'm just delighted to take it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_066.wav	4.05	This happened on three days inside a week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_067.wav	3.07	Funding needs to be long term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_068.wav	3.20	It's funny how it comes and goes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_069.wav	3.07	It was just awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_070.wav	4.27	That is really all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_071.wav	3.08	We played too deeply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_072.wav	3.63	We could have got three medals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_073.wav	2.65	I am ready to go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_074.wav	2.95	We are still suffering from that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_075.wav	2.43	The script was funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_076.wav	2.51	We are at the crossroads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_077.wav	4.06	I am about protecting the state pension.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_078.wav	3.12	They were at school together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_079.wav	3.63	I am looking forward to getting home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_080.wav	3.59	Painful, but only because it's true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_081.wav	3.54	Once they go away they won't come back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_082.wav	3.42	Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_083.wav	3.42	That was the easy election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_084.wav	2.78	I didn't understand it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_085.wav	4.01	We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_086.wav	3.71	Both sides have been hit by injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_087.wav	3.03	No one was listening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_088.wav	3.67	I will report in the spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_089.wav	4.31	We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_090.wav	3.90	I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_091.wav	3.84	It's terrible that this is happening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_092.wav	2.60	He's got the same story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_093.wav	4.27	They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_094.wav	4.18	It is par for the course, of course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_095.wav	2.73	And so it goes on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_096.wav	3.33	The winner will be announced next month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_097.wav	1.70	What was this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_098.wav	3.20	I am not a fan of books.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_099.wav	2.43	It may well have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_100.wav	4.40	Frankly, the party was not being honest with itself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_101.wav	3.03	We can only go up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_102.wav	2.61	I am not a doctor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_103.wav	2.65	It is all in the mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_104.wav	3.03	And we have beaten them before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_105.wav	3.67	Many others are subjected to violence by men.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_106.wav	3.72	Actually, it turned out to be the concerto.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_107.wav	2.82	I am not a paedophile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_108.wav	2.95	I've got to get noticed!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_109.wav	2.52	Not that it was needed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_110.wav	2.78	It's up to them to decide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_111.wav	2.95	But we can't have a casino.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_112.wav	3.25	I would love to play in Europe again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_113.wav	2.82	The odds are that it will.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_114.wav	3.89	After this, they were always in the driving seat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_115.wav	3.67	I had no intention of misleading anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_116.wav	3.71	But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_117.wav	4.19	He also has property interests in the country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_118.wav	3.01	That is the position the MoD has adopted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_119.wav	3.89	The hearing was expected to last six weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_120.wav	2.90	I cannot believe this decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_121.wav	3.71	This decision is destroying my family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_122.wav	2.05	Why is that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_123.wav	2.95	Well, the big day has arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_124.wav	3.08	We reckon we can do very well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_125.wav	3.50	But it's been kept to a minimum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_126.wav	2.65	It has been a great day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_127.wav	2.27	We are not with you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_128.wav	2.57	Then came the crunch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_129.wav	2.39	If so, they were wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_130.wav	3.74	It is open season on the Old Firm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_131.wav	2.73	The answer is maybe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_132.wav	4.27	The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_133.wav	3.29	The referee had a shocking game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_134.wav	5.68	I haven't been able to do it since.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_135.wav	2.78	It's about doing things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_136.wav	3.59	For a few years we had good fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_137.wav	2.78	All the pressure will be on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_139.wav	4.14	This is the logic of punishment assaults.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_140.wav	2.99	That was a good effort.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_141.wav	2.71	We are very hopeful he will be cleared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_142.wav	3.18	He must not be removed from office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_143.wav	3.67	He had finally had enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_144.wav	3.03	But not all were so defiant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_145.wav	3.16	We are not going to get carried away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_146.wav	2.86	I told that to the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_147.wav	3.67	On the other hand, the poster did not help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_148.wav	3.46	In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_149.wav	3.08	But when we do it it is great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_150.wav	5.00	I'm going to win the gold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_151.wav	3.33	He pleaded for caution.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_152.wav	3.50	It always had to be about the gym.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_153.wav	3.24	Only one got through.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_154.wav	2.65	It's like a garage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_155.wav	3.29	They've been wonderful to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_157.wav	2.73	I can't believe the buzz.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_158.wav	2.95	It is a traffic warden.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_159.wav	4.66	When it comes down to it, this is a job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_160.wav	3.37	It had been played at festivals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_161.wav	3.63	That never came to court as a charge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_162.wav	3.08	Dancing was her life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_163.wav	3.16	The latter way is my way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_164.wav	2.78	Staff have been informed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_165.wav	2.56	It is one of those things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_166.wav	3.80	His is a success story by any standard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_167.wav	3.59	Are his works inside out?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_168.wav	2.60	He can do no wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_169.wav	3.71	On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_170.wav	4.10	Do they have to create seven majors?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_171.wav	3.38	It has been handled entirely properly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_172.wav	3.93	I shall be voting Yes to support him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_173.wav	3.50	Is something which we just don't do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_174.wav	2.86	That began as an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_175.wav	4.10	It is, though the law is not clear cut.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_176.wav	3.37	He will want to utilise the midfield.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_177.wav	3.63	Two others were also seriously injured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_178.wav	2.99	I am looking forward to this film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_179.wav	3.93	This has been very frustrating for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_180.wav	3.50	The talking cannot go on too long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_181.wav	2.52	I've got a young family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_182.wav	3.37	I hope that that will be forthcoming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_183.wav	3.12	But experience is a wonderful thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_184.wav	3.29	Footage has been passed on to the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_185.wav	3.03	Of course, there was still much to be done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_186.wav	3.50	If he does, he has a real chance of gold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_187.wav	5.85	Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_188.wav	2.82	It was good today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_189.wav	3.16	She really suffered for her art.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_190.wav	3.41	I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_191.wav	2.43	That tells you something.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_192.wav	2.90	It has been a magical moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_193.wav	3.07	Is that not uncanny?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_194.wav	4.76	Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_195.wav	2.44	The hotel was huge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_196.wav	2.52	These days are over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_197.wav	4.48	A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_198.wav	2.35	Well, you can have a tree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_199.wav	2.56	Or so it is hoped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_201.wav	4.01	He said to give a local injection.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_202.wav	2.86	This is an internal matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_203.wav	3.63	Entries from the event are still being accepted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_204.wav	3.93	They made such decisions in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_205.wav	3.59	That has proved to be a lasting lesson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_206.wav	3.58	I was influenced by all of these things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_207.wav	3.59	He is helping police with their inquiries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_208.wav	4.19	The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_209.wav	3.76	Children also died in Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_210.wav	3.76	I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_211.wav	3.33	We want to get there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_213.wav	3.84	His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_214.wav	4.14	He said he would appeal the sentences.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_215.wav	3.63	The hearing was fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_216.wav	3.76	He has the edge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_217.wav	3.33	This was not a summit about the euro.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_218.wav	3.33	If he leaves, the band is finished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_219.wav	3.12	He saw it all as a big game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_220.wav	2.86	I didn't actually work up a speech.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_221.wav	4.01	Here we have not had one hour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_222.wav	2.99	That was never their agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_223.wav	3.16	But he kept on repeating it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_224.wav	3.67	She is currently in foster care.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_225.wav	2.95	That's the only thing that matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_226.wav	4.52	They were understanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_227.wav	4.19	The service will only survive with change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_228.wav	3.50	It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_229.wav	3.59	As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_230.wav	3.59	You have a very persuasive president.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_231.wav	3.42	It's always the same, isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_232.wav	4.35	She has not returned to work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_233.wav	3.24	We could learn a lot from them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_234.wav	3.67	He is the saviour of South Africa.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_235.wav	3.84	The players are obviously keen to do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_236.wav	2.99	Men should avoid it like the plague.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_237.wav	2.78	It's really good fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_238.wav	4.40	Our positions remains unchanged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_239.wav	2.65	We are expecting a big crowd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_240.wav	3.03	Is a drug dealer?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_241.wav	3.84	We did not complete the process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_242.wav	4.61	Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_243.wav	2.43	Where are you taking her?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_244.wav	4.78	The weather forecast isn't good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_245.wav	4.14	They have not been named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_246.wav	3.59	He died later in hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_247.wav	5.13	It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_248.wav	2.73	He had a great game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_249.wav	4.44	It's still got that at its heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_250.wav	3.16	Actually, nothing much will change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_251.wav	4.61	We will turn the corner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_252.wav	4.78	Of course, it is a tough assignment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_253.wav	4.78	There were too many mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_254.wav	2.73	He says it often enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_255.wav	2.99	However, my position remains the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_256.wav	2.82	It was totally out of the blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_257.wav	2.43	Horses are not affected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_258.wav	2.61	It went on forever.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_259.wav	3.08	I'm not going to change from it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_260.wav	2.01	And they are different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_261.wav	3.24	It would have been very easily done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_262.wav	3.80	He knows the course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_263.wav	4.78	That idea is rubbish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_264.wav	2.86	There is no room for error.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_265.wav	4.14	Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_266.wav	3.24	As, indeed, they would be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_267.wav	4.87	If he could have prevented it happening, he would have.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_268.wav	2.65	We are all suffering.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_269.wav	4.18	People should make their own decisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_270.wav	4.52	That is a question for the next manager.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_271.wav	2.90	I knew people on that committee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_273.wav	2.90	Again, we were lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_274.wav	2.39	There was no argument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_275.wav	3.42	He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_276.wav	3.08	She is a valuable member of Government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_277.wav	3.29	I just need a bit of luck.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_278.wav	3.67	But it's not the end of Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_279.wav	3.29	We are talking about one family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_280.wav	3.58	He is not a pathetic figure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_281.wav	3.93	The error appeared in a warrant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_282.wav	2.48	Everything is so new.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_283.wav	3.41	It may take time to get it back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_284.wav	3.42	Would they work together again?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_285.wav	3.33	I can feel the sound inside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_286.wav	2.73	The answer is yes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_287.wav	3.42	I believe in debate and dialogue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_288.wav	3.46	The second aspect was the fear of failure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_289.wav	3.12	That is a personal matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_290.wav	3.63	The princess has had other health problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_291.wav	3.67	I would rather say nothing at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_292.wav	2.90	The clarity is vital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_293.wav	2.56	I could not sit in the stands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_294.wav	2.60	He had a decision to make.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_295.wav	3.12	Strikers like to go to the ground.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_296.wav	3.16	It makes no influence on the public.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_297.wav	2.44	It's ahead of Labour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_298.wav	3.16	It's the whole package.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_299.wav	2.32	I was totally wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_300.wav	2.69	This has got to stop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_301.wav	2.51	It was a matter of chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_302.wav	3.42	There is no point of looking any further.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_303.wav	2.39	It is a real concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_304.wav	2.39	Is it the flight?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_306.wav	3.71	Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_307.wav	4.06	Scotland doesn't even have a target.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_308.wav	3.08	They really shouldn't have put it out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_309.wav	2.90	A compromise is essential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_310.wav	3.57	Last night, the company could not be contacted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_311.wav	3.50	They need to be involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_312.wav	2.90	It was not a cover-up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_313.wav	4.27	The children continue to talk to us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_314.wav	2.52	You know the sort of thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_315.wav	3.03	I cannot say too much about them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_316.wav	3.72	She went home from school and never returned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_317.wav	3.50	I will work on her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_318.wav	2.26	We told them in August.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_319.wav	3.80	It is not easy to live in Russia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_320.wav	3.63	Green is desperate to play on The Open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_321.wav	4.44	What on earth is happening to rugby?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_322.wav	3.60	It is now being examined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_323.wav	3.12	It is so out of character.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_324.wav	3.42	Otherwise we would all pay the price.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_325.wav	3.93	Our thoughts are with her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_326.wav	2.73	It is time, he said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_327.wav	3.24	Everyone believes in it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_328.wav	2.60	We must learn to finish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_331.wav	2.52	He was a one off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_332.wav	2.78	That should give me a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_333.wav	3.63	Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_334.wav	3.12	It is my last chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_335.wav	2.43	We played them off the pitch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_336.wav	3.46	The service from the other players was super.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_337.wav	4.23	That fight begins today for the freedom and liberty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_338.wav	2.82	He didn't let me down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_339.wav	2.18	You have been warned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_340.wav	3.50	We're not comparing like with like.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_341.wav	4.06	I started on fire a couple of times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_342.wav	4.61	The Shadow Chancellor is always on holiday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_343.wav	2.86	It wasn't good, but we'll get better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_344.wav	3.12	They will be up for it for sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_345.wav	2.56	So you let me know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_346.wav	3.29	He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_347.wav	4.01	That will just be the beginning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_348.wav	3.12	No one can say that about me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_349.wav	2.95	That had not happened on this occasion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_350.wav	4.57	After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_351.wav	3.20	As a nation, we must become more active.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_352.wav	3.42	At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_353.wav	3.03	It is safe in our hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_354.wav	3.03	HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_355.wav	2.74	We will need to look at that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_356.wav	3.24	It comes down to the police in England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_357.wav	3.67	Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_358.wav	2.22	It is a gamble.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_359.wav	3.67	I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_360.wav	3.08	The tribunal continues today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_361.wav	3.76	These things have not happened by accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_362.wav	3.84	So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_363.wav	3.72	Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_364.wav	2.65	There's a hint of classical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_365.wav	3.70	We had to take action to protect them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_366.wav	3.76	Surely they were on a hiding to nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_367.wav	3.37	In the end, however, it all came together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_368.wav	2.73	He is a visionary.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_369.wav	4.57	The warning was lifted late last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_370.wav	2.30	There is always the smell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_371.wav	3.16	I have to take some of the blame.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_372.wav	3.93	And if he hasn't become a musician?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_374.wav	3.38	He is lying to save his skin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_375.wav	2.94	You have to do your research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_376.wav	4.61	He really has everything, including a beautiful swing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_377.wav	2.78	He took away my childhood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_378.wav	3.20	I have spoken to the skipper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_379.wav	2.69	The call was ignored.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_381.wav	3.55	It has happened, and that is the end of the story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_382.wav	3.12	We don't do this for everyone, of course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_383.wav	3.33	And there is another problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_384.wav	2.43	That is the theory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_385.wav	2.31	It almost certainly is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_386.wav	3.20	They will have five minutes to decide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_387.wav	2.44	Because it's a secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_388.wav	3.89	My wife and family are the support system.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_389.wav	2.82	The body follows the mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_390.wav	3.59	I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_391.wav	2.65	They are there to help us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_392.wav	4.01	It just isn't a defining issue for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_393.wav	2.26	You take a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_394.wav	2.86	Which he is, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_395.wav	3.24	Each one is as good as the other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_396.wav	3.20	Sub Not Used, McArthur.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_397.wav	2.52	I have hardly any commitments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_398.wav	2.18	There is no formula.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_399.wav	4.11	The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p343\p343_400.wav	2.90	I love the feel of the place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_001.wav	2.18	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_002.wav	4.91	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_003.wav	7.90	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_004.wav	5.51	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_005.wav	7.55	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_006.wav	6.83	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_007.wav	5.29	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_008.wav	8.45	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_009.wav	5.12	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_010.wav	3.07	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_011.wav	6.74	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_012.wav	6.11	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_013.wav	5.16	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_014.wav	4.99	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_015.wav	5.81	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_016.wav	6.53	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_017.wav	4.14	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_018.wav	5.98	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_019.wav	7.13	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_020.wav	4.31	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_021.wav	9.05	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_022.wav	7.51	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_023.wav	11.61	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_024.wav	7.09	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_025.wav	3.46	This is a new era.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_026.wav	2.94	I want to go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_027.wav	2.56	All the people here are local.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_028.wav	3.03	The racist abuse was terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_029.wav	2.95	What is the new religion?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_030.wav	2.82	The Farmer is called an idiot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_031.wav	2.95	It's an amazing landscape!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_032.wav	2.31	I am prepared to step down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_033.wav	3.72	It's a lot of pressure on me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_034.wav	3.67	We had to laugh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_035.wav	3.37	It is too pretty, it is too small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_036.wav	4.40	We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_037.wav	3.50	I was completely knackered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_038.wav	3.20	I'd rather be singing Verdi.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_039.wav	2.69	A killer is also on the loose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_040.wav	3.58	Rangers are struggling and their team have injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_041.wav	3.03	You've got to be vigilant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_042.wav	3.38	You can see how he made his money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_043.wav	3.42	However, there were some alarming findings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_044.wav	2.82	Who wants to be a Millionaire?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_045.wav	3.33	We would certainly consider the proposals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_046.wav	3.20	I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_047.wav	3.46	His record with England was not good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_048.wav	2.73	The opposite is the case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_049.wav	2.35	Who would be a referee?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_050.wav	3.54	Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_051.wav	3.46	It was time to act.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_052.wav	2.35	It's a question of fashion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_053.wav	2.52	I could never be cool.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_054.wav	3.16	We will be paying agency rates.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_055.wav	3.46	Others said he had gone too far.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_056.wav	3.54	We expect them to deliver for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_057.wav	3.20	He was between people and God.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_058.wav	2.65	I've never seen anything like it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_059.wav	3.25	They were willing us to get a second.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_060.wav	2.82	No casualties were reported.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_061.wav	2.44	The classes are taking place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_062.wav	2.95	If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_063.wav	2.86	The sleeper was six hours late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_064.wav	2.82	There will be no threat to the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_065.wav	2.78	It would be a last resort.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_066.wav	3.12	That is part of athletics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_067.wav	2.31	Who would have known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_068.wav	2.39	We were caught out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_069.wav	4.69	It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_070.wav	3.80	I haven't made any definite decisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_071.wav	2.18	I had to lie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_072.wav	3.16	Among them is his beloved teacher.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_073.wav	2.86	Everyone was writing me off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_074.wav	2.73	How do we get more people in?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_075.wav	3.16	The defender made an impressive debut.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_076.wav	3.16	But her parents will never see her again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_077.wav	3.50	Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_078.wav	2.39	I have nothing to lose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_079.wav	2.35	He would have loved it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_080.wav	3.12	We should be capable of managing it, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_081.wav	2.86	It was that kind of afternoon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_082.wav	2.56	It is a freedom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_083.wav	2.18	What happens next?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_084.wav	3.76	All our futures will already have been decided.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_085.wav	3.03	I would have been shot dead in bed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_086.wav	3.20	He insisted that his staff were too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_087.wav	2.35	They should come clean.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_088.wav	2.95	He was pronounced dead in hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_089.wav	2.65	I believe that so strongly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_090.wav	2.56	That, though, is an old story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_091.wav	2.69	Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_092.wav	2.35	They don't work anymore anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_093.wav	4.10	It's about time something was done about equipment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_094.wav	3.12	It was a funny feeling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_095.wav	2.61	He was at it again yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_096.wav	2.31	You can't go on forever.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_097.wav	2.78	So far this season this approach is working.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_098.wav	2.99	However, his involvement was instant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_099.wav	2.05	It has to work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_100.wav	2.94	It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_101.wav	2.99	Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_102.wav	2.90	There's something about being cut off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_103.wav	2.69	This is his personal life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_104.wav	3.29	I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_105.wav	2.82	If not, a deal could take many months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_106.wav	2.90	It's as eventful as it is momentous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_107.wav	2.56	I was going to help with the dinner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_108.wav	2.61	Would you pay to come and see it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_109.wav	2.01	What are they like?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_110.wav	2.99	I would probably have to agree with him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_111.wav	3.24	They were back in favour with the SAC.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_112.wav	1.71	He had a moustache.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_113.wav	2.52	I have been thinking about that this week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_114.wav	2.35	Let's get it on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_115.wav	4.23	Together they will attempt to express the whole.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_116.wav	3.55	Everyone is deeply shocked by this appaling accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_117.wav	2.52	It is really good news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_118.wav	2.60	We just want a fair deal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_119.wav	2.56	I'll just have to live with that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_120.wav	2.65	Neither of them was badly hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_121.wav	3.54	He is the Acting and Deputy First Minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_122.wav	3.20	We wanted it left for a wee while.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_123.wav	4.48	At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_124.wav	4.66	It is sad and frustrating.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_125.wav	5.30	Our intentions are real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_126.wav	5.34	The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_127.wav	6.23	Finding the answer is a hugely enjoyable experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_128.wav	3.29	She has left the island.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_129.wav	3.80	That will be the case on Tuesday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_130.wav	3.25	As to rugby, well, no-one knows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_131.wav	3.88	It certainly should not be used too often.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_132.wav	3.80	The whole matter is done and dusted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_133.wav	3.46	I don't know where that one came from.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_134.wav	3.20	The shooting created panic in the street.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_135.wav	3.93	He would just say it was terrible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_136.wav	2.69	Our destiny is in our own hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_137.wav	2.78	That's not fair to the supporters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_138.wav	2.22	I was on my own.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_139.wav	2.86	They were part of our own family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_140.wav	3.37	It doesn't exactly have the same appeal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_141.wav	2.39	I don't have any perspective on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_142.wav	2.56	Scotland has lost a great man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_143.wav	3.50	Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_144.wav	3.20	In fact, they will not be disciplined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_145.wav	2.90	His name has not been released.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_146.wav	3.16	For some, it was more painful than others.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_147.wav	2.56	It plainly does not work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_148.wav	2.14	His words were not audible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_149.wav	2.18	That's a huge amount.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_150.wav	3.20	See the amazing arrogance of this, they say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_151.wav	2.56	It was even worse than at home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_152.wav	2.82	I still think he will win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_153.wav	2.65	But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_154.wav	2.52	Normally it would be four minutes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_155.wav	2.95	It may have been a cry for help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_156.wav	2.44	But the damage had been done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_157.wav	2.26	No, you couldn't make it up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_158.wav	2.52	We are trying to clarify the issues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_159.wav	3.25	However, he did not stay there very long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_160.wav	2.26	And so they have.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_161.wav	2.78	I have a great respect for her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_162.wav	2.48	I suggest a new plan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_163.wav	2.74	IT takes the biscuit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_164.wav	3.76	But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_165.wav	3.20	We don't have a solution to the problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_166.wav	2.82	Miller was every bit as happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_167.wav	2.90	The result is utterly compelling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_168.wav	3.03	But it won't be the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_169.wav	3.16	Other forces were, however, at work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_170.wav	3.67	Inspiring public confidence is crucial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_171.wav	3.12	It is a hobby for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_172.wav	3.46	If only the acting profession was that simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_173.wav	3.16	It was like a kick in the belly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_174.wav	2.91	Bombing is the easy option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_175.wav	2.60	We should have gone solo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_176.wav	2.26	Directing, if you like.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_177.wav	2.39	That will be the case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_178.wav	2.91	Now, it's all right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_179.wav	2.43	All will be revealed in due course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_180.wav	3.93	They have known the hard times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_181.wav	2.35	We don't know what happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_182.wav	3.07	You cannot enter the clubhouse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_183.wav	3.24	They had seven children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_184.wav	4.10	That in itself is an erotic experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_185.wav	5.00	Death is outside the language.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_186.wav	2.99	You have a plan?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_187.wav	4.01	It's all too early.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_188.wav	5.55	Everything in the world was focused on London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_189.wav	4.95	We've seen that time and time again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_190.wav	5.16	I was never alone with her, right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_191.wav	4.23	It's not only my respect for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_192.wav	3.63	Tonight's matches European Championship.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_193.wav	4.40	This is a very high price.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_194.wav	3.54	That's when you hope to take advantage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_195.wav	4.48	I never want to have any children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_196.wav	6.06	Business has never been so bad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_197.wav	2.90	There is no way to do this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_198.wav	5.51	Edinburgh was not included in the survey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_199.wav	2.65	I know my sons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_200.wav	3.50	Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_201.wav	2.52	It was too close to call.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_202.wav	2.26	But who is the killer?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_203.wav	2.48	No, it's never been mentioned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_204.wav	3.16	Things were so intense in the studio.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_205.wav	3.46	The devil, of course, will be in the detail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_206.wav	2.22	Then another one came.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_207.wav	3.29	Progress is being made but it is slow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_208.wav	2.91	Everything has been destroyed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_209.wav	2.52	The Lobby is not failing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_210.wav	4.23	But it is looking very positive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_211.wav	2.94	Drugs are getting through.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_212.wav	2.91	He would have come into the house.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_213.wav	3.46	I want to put myself on discussion also.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_214.wav	3.20	It happens in real life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_215.wav	3.41	At the time, he was a living legend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_216.wav	2.56	And we will do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_217.wav	2.52	It's a human tragedy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_218.wav	3.03	But we are losing that connection.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_219.wav	2.78	I am going to fight to the end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_220.wav	3.58	Either group is living in fantasy land.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_221.wav	2.69	It's the right thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_222.wav	3.03	That was a disgraceful performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_223.wav	3.76	Must have been at the bar.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_224.wav	3.08	But this is just the start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_225.wav	2.56	I can't get away from it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_226.wav	2.56	I believe in the Union.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_227.wav	2.60	SCOTLAND has shown the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_228.wav	2.69	But he is not hopeful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_229.wav	3.24	It will be all about the Olympics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_230.wav	2.26	They are very frightened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_231.wav	3.08	We have all been there at some point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_232.wav	3.80	This is my homeland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_233.wav	3.38	The game was up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_234.wav	3.72	That is not an easy thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_235.wav	3.76	Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_236.wav	2.99	I didn't know where they were.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_237.wav	2.61	Rangers are my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_238.wav	4.18	Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_239.wav	4.52	Three weeks later, he resigned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_240.wav	2.35	There are two options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_241.wav	2.01	I can't describe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_242.wav	2.56	Surely it should be the other way round.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_243.wav	3.59	There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_244.wav	2.99	I get on him, he gets on me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_245.wav	3.50	This is wonderful news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_246.wav	6.10	I am appalled by this news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_247.wav	4.78	No injuries were reported.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_248.wav	5.63	It is not surprising, but it is appaling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_249.wav	4.99	It is understood he had been stabbed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_250.wav	3.29	It's too much work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_251.wav	5.21	We were extremely arrogant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_252.wav	4.14	Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_253.wav	3.97	THE waiting game continues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_254.wav	3.50	Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_255.wav	2.99	I don't think he was being very fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_256.wav	3.20	You've got to fight to stay up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_257.wav	4.01	But the foundations have been laid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_258.wav	2.90	We're looking for unity in the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_259.wav	4.31	The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_260.wav	4.10	What is so unusual about this case?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_261.wav	3.16	Fatherhood is important to Tony Blair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_262.wav	2.73	But this is different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_263.wav	3.54	I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_264.wav	4.23	It doesn't look good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_265.wav	2.22	That will not change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_266.wav	2.31	He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_267.wav	3.24	Her presence was almost everywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_268.wav	3.88	Asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_269.wav	5.38	It doesn't make a whole lot of difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_270.wav	4.06	There is enormous interest in Scotland the Brand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_271.wav	2.95	They've been at it for five hours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_272.wav	2.65	This action could have been avoided.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_273.wav	3.16	The distinction is also supported by doctors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_274.wav	4.27	And they still have the final to come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_275.wav	5.59	Anyone else can apply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_276.wav	2.52	He looked like a schoolboy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_277.wav	2.56	It was like the old days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_278.wav	2.82	But that is about to change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_279.wav	3.20	The whole thing has been a fantastic experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_280.wav	2.61	We can build on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_281.wav	5.85	It could be a danger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_282.wav	3.16	We are not going to be complacent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_283.wav	2.90	The only problem was, they were on himself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_284.wav	3.25	His body was found in May.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_285.wav	2.69	He's a joy to follow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_286.wav	2.82	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_287.wav	3.03	I'm sure you all can relate to that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_288.wav	2.65	My wife is coming over at the weekend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_289.wav	3.12	Sure, he is the best player in the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_290.wav	2.69	It starts to get you down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_291.wav	3.59	I don't think we could have expected better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_292.wav	7.34	My life has been turned upside down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_293.wav	3.24	Somebody has to speak up for common sense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_294.wav	2.95	But they miss the whole point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_295.wav	2.90	You have to count on other people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_296.wav	2.99	I said, What was that about?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_297.wav	2.65	Immediate action must be taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_298.wav	3.20	This could prove a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_299.wav	2.60	I was a local hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_300.wav	3.42	He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_301.wav	3.12	It will be extremely difficult for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_302.wav	2.31	It's a gigantic con.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_303.wav	3.50	Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_304.wav	2.73	This club have been fair to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_305.wav	2.56	I didn't know she could do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_306.wav	3.80	What does she consider her greatest achievement?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_307.wav	3.16	This is too much like Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_308.wav	3.41	I can't say anything about any figure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_309.wav	2.86	A counter reaction was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_310.wav	2.35	That goes back a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_311.wav	2.95	I wouldn't have had the abandon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_312.wav	3.88	She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_313.wav	2.56	They were not missing much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_314.wav	3.84	It should not make the same mistake again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_315.wav	4.44	Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_316.wav	5.33	The record companies have gone through the floor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_317.wav	7.90	It's always a dilemma.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_318.wav	3.93	As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_319.wav	2.27	Is she in trouble?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_320.wav	2.95	It is a symbolic concert.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_321.wav	2.30	They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_322.wav	2.99	It is a very beautiful city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_323.wav	3.50	She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_324.wav	3.03	But could it afford to run it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_325.wav	3.03	I am very happy with him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_326.wav	2.69	I was waiting for that question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_327.wav	2.95	Her body was found on Monday morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_328.wav	2.65	I am not against a further inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_329.wav	2.99	His father said, My son was lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_330.wav	2.30	WHO would have thought it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_331.wav	2.26	We will win the argument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_332.wav	3.42	Five years later, the deception continued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_333.wav	3.29	I might get an injury very easily.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_334.wav	3.08	I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_335.wav	3.33	Stock markets will be watching closely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_336.wav	2.01	I just want to do the good work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_337.wav	2.65	I'm very happy tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_338.wav	3.46	He was overwhelmed by the response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_339.wav	3.93	Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_340.wav	2.90	Now it was serious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_341.wav	2.61	This is his first movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_342.wav	2.56	He is already in place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_343.wav	2.52	No one would believe him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_344.wav	2.78	We live in shorthand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_345.wav	3.93	But something has been lost in the translation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_346.wav	3.16	Spent three months alone at sea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_347.wav	2.69	I made a big mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_348.wav	2.90	I just know it's a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_349.wav	2.39	I saw one body.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_350.wav	2.01	I am very happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_351.wav	2.82	There was no discussion about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_352.wav	2.78	Three hours later, the man was free.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_353.wav	2.78	It was a very big win for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_354.wav	3.37	I've never felt affection for Emu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_355.wav	2.05	Everything is up for grabs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_356.wav	2.57	We had a good time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_357.wav	3.63	I was utterly hopeless at it, it must be said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_358.wav	2.65	This was a good performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_359.wav	5.80	However, the snow was welcomed by some.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_360.wav	2.86	It is not simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_361.wav	3.03	We also enjoyed a lot of support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_362.wav	2.86	Our task is to complete the picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_363.wav	2.65	It is a road of death.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_364.wav	2.95	The Government would be ready, they said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_365.wav	2.99	Her life is now back on track.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_366.wav	2.61	I said at the time it was wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_367.wav	3.76	By now he was very ill with cancer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_368.wav	2.99	Anything that was going, really.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_369.wav	2.91	He will take it in his stride.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_370.wav	2.39	I don't believe a word of it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_371.wav	2.26	I couldn't put my finger on it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_372.wav	3.67	People can really get themselves in a mess.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_373.wav	3.25	The winner will be announced in December.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_374.wav	2.01	This is bound to happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_375.wav	2.95	Suddenly, there was an audience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_376.wav	3.54	It has not yet opened to pupils.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_377.wav	2.82	The letters are going out today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_378.wav	2.27	I did not name it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_379.wav	2.65	And therein lies the problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_380.wav	3.37	I also thought, This is a feature film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_381.wav	3.42	McMaster had already seen the first part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_382.wav	2.01	Or is it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_383.wav	2.60	Is he going to look after them?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_384.wav	3.08	They are appealing for witnesses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_385.wav	4.44	This is the last chance, and everyone knows it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_386.wav	3.50	It is quite simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_387.wav	0.09	My whole life has changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_388.wav	1.11	But perhaps it was all for the best.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_389.wav	3.33	It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_390.wav	2.52	His instructions were clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_391.wav	3.12	There is ample evidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_392.wav	2.82	It was a game we had to win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_393.wav	4.48	I've never had problems with any football managers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_394.wav	2.73	To begin with it looks good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_395.wav	2.48	I won't go back to Holland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_396.wav	2.95	There is still a long way to go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_397.wav	3.08	Almost overnight, he found his voice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_398.wav	2.90	This was a unique election.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_399.wav	2.69	It was still there last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p345\p345_400.wav	3.67	In his absence, the council adopted the change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_001.wav	2.39	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_002.wav	4.27	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_003.wav	8.28	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_004.wav	5.47	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_005.wav	9.30	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_006.wav	6.44	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_007.wav	4.82	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_008.wav	9.99	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_009.wav	4.82	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_010.wav	3.71	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_011.wav	8.45	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_012.wav	5.25	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_013.wav	4.78	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_014.wav	5.34	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_015.wav	6.19	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_016.wav	6.96	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_017.wav	3.97	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_018.wav	6.36	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_019.wav	8.92	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_020.wav	4.87	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_021.wav	11.82	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_022.wav	7.39	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_023.wav	13.23	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_024.wav	7.17	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_025.wav	3.29	A crucial moment has arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_026.wav	3.29	We still have a long, long way to go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_027.wav	3.58	Some will be deployed on submarines.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_028.wav	2.82	There are moments of silence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_029.wav	3.93	So now this series has had its day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_030.wav	4.14	Gaelic provision continued to be good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_031.wav	3.63	Bobby Robson called him a genius.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_032.wav	3.37	It's a policy which has worked for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_033.wav	4.05	Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_034.wav	3.03	That didn't happen for two reasons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_035.wav	3.12	His views are hardly surprising.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_036.wav	2.95	It is time for a new approach.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_037.wav	3.25	And look at the leading conductors, he says.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_038.wav	2.82	We have nothing to say about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_039.wav	2.86	We've tried every other way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_040.wav	3.37	I'll have to go out and impress.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_041.wav	4.44	Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_043.wav	2.96	He had a really frustrating time last year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_044.wav	3.07	It does make a big difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_045.wav	3.72	How many cases have there been?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_046.wav	3.37	Peter, of course, refuses to conform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_047.wav	3.25	You can't give in to the vandals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_048.wav	3.08	The Old Firm are going nowhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_049.wav	2.52	Everything was an effort.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_050.wav	2.57	And does it even matter?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_051.wav	3.46	George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_052.wav	2.09	My parents are exhausted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_053.wav	3.93	No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_054.wav	4.40	Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_055.wav	3.37	If he does not leave, he will be shot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_056.wav	3.25	My thoughts are with their families.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_057.wav	2.22	It will come up here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_058.wav	3.63	From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_059.wav	3.42	Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_060.wav	2.82	It is a very special city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_061.wav	3.12	This is only the start of my season.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_062.wav	3.37	The message is just not getting through.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_063.wav	2.86	It sounded awfully like panic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_064.wav	2.26	I've taken to the hills.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_065.wav	2.65	This is a big, big win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_066.wav	2.22	The crowd was awesome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_067.wav	2.61	My game is in pretty good shape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_068.wav	2.14	We were given a break.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_069.wav	3.07	He already had had complaints.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_070.wav	3.29	How come it is so often unnoticed?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_071.wav	3.55	I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_072.wav	3.80	Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_073.wav	2.86	They had not been handcuffed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_074.wav	3.24	I think we will join the single currency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_075.wav	3.59	Then it was the turn of the carnival.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_076.wav	2.90	You have to rely on each other.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_077.wav	2.22	One thing is certain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_078.wav	2.78	We cannot ask for them back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_079.wav	3.67	It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_080.wav	3.33	No-one said anything to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_081.wav	1.88	All of us do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_082.wav	2.91	That is in the public domain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_083.wav	2.65	The Hague is too good for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_084.wav	4.70	On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_085.wav	3.97	In just a fortnight, however, everything has changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_086.wav	2.77	It's a true story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_087.wav	3.08	This is a club on the rise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_088.wav	5.81	John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_089.wav	2.69	Theatre is not a museum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_090.wav	2.73	It is a hangover effect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_091.wav	2.10	This is my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_092.wav	3.16	Subs not used, McCulloch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_093.wav	4.18	Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_094.wav	3.03	The thing is to recognise that chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_095.wav	2.22	We gave them the goal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_096.wav	2.86	They don't take you to mass graves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_097.wav	3.33	There was no option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_098.wav	2.99	What's it got to do with art?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_099.wav	2.90	Could they perhaps be related?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_100.wav	2.69	But who shot the president?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_101.wav	2.95	We do not get that impression now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_102.wav	2.31	I'm looking forward to that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_103.wav	3.59	It was not a beautiful game, was it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_104.wav	2.82	Safety was also an issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_105.wav	2.09	That's why he visited.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_106.wav	2.78	I know a lot of people who don't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_107.wav	2.35	There was nobody on the roof.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_108.wav	2.52	Clark is back on top form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_109.wav	4.05	He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_110.wav	2.69	It needs somebody to give way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_111.wav	3.50	We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_112.wav	3.33	It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_113.wav	2.22	They are all Arabs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_114.wav	3.24	The days of empty promises are over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_115.wav	2.69	Henry was strong and talented.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_116.wav	2.61	That is our unfinished business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_117.wav	3.59	Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_118.wav	2.86	Faces from the Eighties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_119.wav	3.76	Why did it take a concerted campaign?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_120.wav	3.92	Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_121.wav	3.84	Whatever he does, however, it will be decisive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_122.wav	2.65	You can cope with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_123.wav	3.55	It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_124.wav	2.39	They will do their own thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_125.wav	3.59	Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_126.wav	3.12	We are in the business of selling tickets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_127.wav	3.63	It is just part of modern day life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_128.wav	3.46	A young Briton had a lucky escape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_129.wav	3.42	Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_130.wav	3.54	Treatment is not an issue with these people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_131.wav	2.73	YOU thought it was a headache.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_132.wav	3.08	All the people thought that we would die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_133.wav	2.61	It is never an easy game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_134.wav	3.07	This year it will be Billy Crystal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_135.wav	2.90	No-one else is like Michael Jackson.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_136.wav	2.31	I don't want to come down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_137.wav	2.69	However, it's good to turn the page.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_138.wav	2.61	I thought it was quite good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_139.wav	2.52	He had reason to be pleased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_140.wav	3.46	It was important to win the singles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_141.wav	2.99	That is impressive by any standards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_142.wav	2.86	I felt we needed to bring that in.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_143.wav	3.24	There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_144.wav	3.20	I'm thinking, what would be easier?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_145.wav	2.78	That alibi is now gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_146.wav	3.59	But the cost to his health was enormous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_147.wav	3.54	Too many factors are now working against him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_148.wav	2.27	Is the war over?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_149.wav	2.43	You do have a way out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_150.wav	2.35	It is simple, really.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_151.wav	2.86	I just wasn't very good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_152.wav	3.08	Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_153.wav	2.39	But he is not using them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_154.wav	3.46	Christians in Pakistan are terrified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_155.wav	2.95	I certainly believe we can do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_156.wav	3.29	They've got a sort of unwritten contract.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_157.wav	2.78	It was a breathtaking moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_158.wav	2.99	That's been our position all along.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_159.wav	2.69	I was in jail for five years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_160.wav	2.90	We have not had a formal request.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_161.wav	2.13	I never had a childhood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_162.wav	3.29	Its effect on humans is not yet known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_163.wav	3.07	We offered something different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_164.wav	3.16	We were very much a happy family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_165.wav	2.90	They won the trophy in the Hoops.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_166.wav	3.80	It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_167.wav	2.52	It's going to be epic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_168.wav	4.10	Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_169.wav	3.25	It was large enough to fit the wall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_170.wav	2.56	She could easily have been killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_171.wav	3.33	British officials said they could not say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_172.wav	4.18	Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_173.wav	2.22	I never found my rhythm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_174.wav	2.26	I didn't mean to kill her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_175.wav	2.99	It is a job creation scheme.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_176.wav	3.76	In less than two months, the women have achieved a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_177.wav	2.61	We might be back next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_178.wav	3.12	It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_179.wav	2.48	The same goes for personnel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_180.wav	3.54	Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_181.wav	2.94	In fact, they should have scored three times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_182.wav	3.93	Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_183.wav	3.03	This area is perfect for children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_184.wav	2.65	The firm was down and almost out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_185.wav	2.18	I was chosen to do this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_186.wav	2.05	I learned a lot from that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_187.wav	2.31	I think we're very different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_188.wav	3.25	The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_189.wav	2.74	There was an element of jealousy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_190.wav	2.52	Glasgow then took control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_191.wav	3.46	Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_192.wav	2.95	My ambitions are still with football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_193.wav	2.99	That certainly brought me back down to earth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_194.wav	3.84	Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_195.wav	4.52	Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_196.wav	4.44	We have no idea what caused the derailment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_197.wav	3.59	Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_198.wav	2.31	Our approach will be different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_199.wav	2.44	It's not right of Labour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_200.wav	2.09	It is legally binding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_201.wav	2.73	We went straight into the bedroom.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_202.wav	3.33	Before the games it was pretty open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_203.wav	2.82	But you can go beyond that condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_204.wav	3.50	He is only now regaining his confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_205.wav	2.57	Singing has gone out of fashion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_206.wav	3.29	He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_207.wav	3.76	Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_208.wav	2.22	Who can tell?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_209.wav	3.93	However, the great thing is that it doesn't matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_210.wav	3.76	They might also be reviewed by their colleagues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_211.wav	4.14	My attitude is exactly the same as before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_212.wav	4.19	I've invented a village in East Lothian.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_213.wav	3.97	Or some thought that they have.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_214.wav	3.80	He has lost confidence and weight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_215.wav	2.73	That was moving the goalposts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_216.wav	4.44	This process of attrition is expected to continue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_217.wav	4.27	A Treasury spokesman derided the Tory charge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_218.wav	3.12	You'll get on like a house on fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_219.wav	3.08	Two and a half million people have died.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_220.wav	2.43	It could not be too high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_221.wav	2.26	Or so it would appear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_222.wav	2.99	Do not forget about Monaco.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_223.wav	2.69	I hope they understand that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_224.wav	2.01	You can never tell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_225.wav	2.95	But Annika is just amazing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_226.wav	2.61	Our job is to change that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_227.wav	2.56	She will also get a pay rise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_228.wav	2.69	The damage has been done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_229.wav	3.93	It is time for a more honest approach.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_230.wav	3.12	That's the National Grid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_231.wav	4.14	That is very, very bad news for our nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_232.wav	3.72	Nobody can change it overnight, but you can make a start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_233.wav	2.73	It is a big time for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_234.wav	3.42	There were two things going on at once.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_235.wav	2.73	He wouldn't allow that to happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_236.wav	2.48	It is a cause for concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_237.wav	2.60	Stalkers are capable of killing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_238.wav	1.92	That is the key message.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_239.wav	2.43	It ignores the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_240.wav	2.60	This is the subway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_241.wav	3.63	Altman has every right to be bitter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_242.wav	2.22	What's the rush?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_243.wav	3.54	Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_244.wav	3.03	He's in with the furniture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_245.wav	3.67	Do not go into government buildings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_246.wav	2.82	There is only one caveat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_247.wav	2.99	We are still getting signals.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_248.wav	3.50	What's it got to do with them, anyway?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_249.wav	2.86	I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_250.wav	3.25	Nothing is being offered in exchange.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_251.wav	2.44	Everyone can be bought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_252.wav	2.31	There are a few changes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_253.wav	2.43	You're not going to get hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_254.wav	2.61	THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_255.wav	4.23	The New Deal will constantly be improved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_256.wav	4.82	THE headless man has finally developed a face.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_257.wav	2.77	I heard some of his remarks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_258.wav	2.39	I am a little bit tired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_259.wav	3.46	Staff should be paid for what they produce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_260.wav	2.95	I was just overwhelmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_261.wav	3.08	It had been in place since last July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_262.wav	3.07	I have just got to get back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_263.wav	4.18	In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_264.wav	3.20	Players want to know what is on offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_265.wav	3.42	Well, when did he ever refuse?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_266.wav	3.46	We will have to see, but it makes you think.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_267.wav	4.01	I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_268.wav	3.07	The singer's condition was not specified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_269.wav	2.82	How much of a cop out is that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_270.wav	3.07	The whole region is in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_271.wav	4.18	It was a journey into a new life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_272.wav	3.29	It will be the final push.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_273.wav	3.54	Life, as many people know it, in other words.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_274.wav	2.31	You were the kidnappers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_275.wav	3.07	It is a very interesting subject.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_276.wav	3.03	Arguably, they have already done it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_277.wav	3.88	She had been in Germany for medical treatment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_278.wav	2.77	Raymond was always on the outside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_279.wav	3.20	The women were on their way home yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_280.wav	2.78	I could feel the blood on my face.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_281.wav	3.07	I am a committed European.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_282.wav	2.90	There are no plans to change this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_283.wav	3.21	The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_284.wav	4.99	It's in the eyes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_285.wav	3.71	Working with him is like working with myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_286.wav	2.82	It is just too long since the war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_287.wav	2.73	She didn't tell us anything new.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_288.wav	2.22	I mean it happens.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_289.wav	3.21	My wife is totally behind me on this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_290.wav	2.43	Debbie Harry was cool.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_291.wav	4.44	Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_292.wav	2.85	Receiving this medal is an honour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_293.wav	3.46	Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_294.wav	4.38	Six months later, they returned to Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_295.wav	3.07	It is typical of me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_296.wav	3.54	Raised the way you want it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_297.wav	3.54	However, consumers may take a different view.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_298.wav	3.16	I know you went back this morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_299.wav	3.03	They played it like a cup final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_300.wav	2.69	This has a number of benefits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_301.wav	2.18	I will carry on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_302.wav	3.33	I think it is a great shame.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_303.wav	3.12	A review of the decision is being sought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_304.wav	4.18	It will be about commitment, not compliance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_305.wav	2.65	The chief constable is right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_306.wav	2.35	And we were right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_307.wav	3.20	That is where the club has gone wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_308.wav	4.36	A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_309.wav	3.12	Surely it can do better than that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_310.wav	2.90	It's my favourite place to hang out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_311.wav	3.16	I think that could work to our advantage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_312.wav	3.12	I, like an idiot, agreed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_313.wav	4.19	Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_314.wav	3.12	He will make an excellent chief inspector.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_315.wav	3.59	We hope this scheme will change that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_316.wav	3.29	I cannot confirm the name of any driver.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_317.wav	2.52	The red card was okay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_318.wav	3.16	The Government has to grasp the nettle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_319.wav	4.61	Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_320.wav	3.89	I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_321.wav	3.59	However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_322.wav	3.50	I was doing well at the hustings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_323.wav	4.18	But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_324.wav	2.26	This is my music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_325.wav	2.48	I haven't won the world title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_326.wav	3.67	After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_327.wav	3.59	It's fantastic to have finally won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_328.wav	3.54	But she's also beautiful behind the face.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_329.wav	2.73	There is no date on this document.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_330.wav	2.56	And now he tells us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_331.wav	2.95	I am not changing my event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_332.wav	3.84	I know nothing about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_333.wav	2.71	Ferguson did not hesitate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_334.wav	3.20	That is as it may be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_335.wav	3.72	They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_336.wav	3.16	This is the start of a new campaign.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_337.wav	3.03	Eleven events are required.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_338.wav	4.31	It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_339.wav	2.35	You encourage them - you can do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_340.wav	2.67	The winner will be announced by early summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_341.wav	2.56	I always said No.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_342.wav	3.33	Britain is a peaceful nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_343.wav	3.61	Government must recognise the problems of Aberdeen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_344.wav	3.12	It is very much a matter for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_345.wav	2.65	Our future was his future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_346.wav	3.29	His name is Michael Owen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_347.wav	2.60	It has made a difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_348.wav	3.93	He's got a great chance of making it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_349.wav	3.46	Tartan Day is not a Scottish event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_350.wav	3.35	Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_351.wav	2.39	So now you know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_352.wav	4.01	But, at the same time, they made you think about life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_353.wav	3.07	It's a very special unit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_354.wav	3.46	We will learn lessons from what has happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_355.wav	2.95	I foolishly had done nothing about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_356.wav	4.48	Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_357.wav	4.23	By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_358.wav	2.69	Smith has not let him down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_359.wav	2.13	Which he can do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_360.wav	3.33	No, it's actually in a block of flats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_361.wav	2.31	They were that poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_362.wav	2.52	And we're talking Big Money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_363.wav	2.99	His silence on the issue is interesting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_364.wav	2.86	I was a little surprised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_365.wav	2.99	It was a bit like having children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_366.wav	2.55	With Pierre, you can never be sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_367.wav	2.28	They believed it worked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_368.wav	3.07	I'm really proud of my young players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_369.wav	3.33	As it happened, it was much more than that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_370.wav	2.95	It's an internal matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_371.wav	2.52	They should feel ashamed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_372.wav	3.50	You realise what this means?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_373.wav	2.86	We're delighted about the vote.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_374.wav	3.24	They were only there for three weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_375.wav	3.29	I'm just looking to take my chances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_376.wav	4.35	Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_377.wav	2.99	It is just completely erased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_378.wav	4.66	To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_379.wav	3.71	It's been like that for ages, according to the guys.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_380.wav	2.65	It's not just for classical music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_381.wav	3.33	This must be kept in total perspective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_382.wav	2.95	Election results are expected soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_383.wav	2.99	All of the names are familiar to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_384.wav	2.69	There are moments of honesty, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_385.wav	2.35	They didn't find anything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_386.wav	2.26	Is that where we are?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_387.wav	3.07	We used to keep our business rates.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_388.wav	3.59	It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_389.wav	2.22	I suspect that it will.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_390.wav	2.31	But there's no eye contact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_391.wav	2.82	There was no energy behind it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_392.wav	3.84	They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_393.wav	11.14	Even for a British Open, this is different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_394.wav	2.43	I took a minibus into town.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_395.wav	3.46	They have not allowed them to defend themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_396.wav	4.48	Completion is expected by October the following year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_397.wav	2.91	It is not a wish list.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_398.wav	3.37	Some of the players have not progressed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_399.wav	2.61	They were both very brave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_400.wav	2.61	There is no margin for error.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_401.wav	3.29	Why should we even be asked to share?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_402.wav	2.39	It was not a foul.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_403.wav	2.82	I get very excited by that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_404.wav	3.20	The members have clearly spoken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_405.wav	3.16	In the end, it will mean an awful lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_406.wav	2.01	I believe in God.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_407.wav	2.39	Which means it matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_408.wav	3.63	There is great potential on this river.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_409.wav	3.20	We can't win a big game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_410.wav	2.22	It was a stunning strike.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_411.wav	2.86	This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_412.wav	3.16	She said he showed no remorse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_413.wav	2.78	We are going through difficult times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_414.wav	3.41	There can be no compromise on that demand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_415.wav	2.35	What exactly is your job?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_416.wav	3.63	However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_417.wav	2.56	There's nothing for you here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_418.wav	2.86	I grew up listening to these people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_419.wav	2.77	They wanted to show what they could do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_420.wav	2.44	I just want to get rid of it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_421.wav	3.37	Officials say the city must achieve this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_422.wav	3.89	It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_423.wav	2.99	I have not come in to take over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p347\p347_424.wav	2.44	Is this accurate?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_001.wav	2.31	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_002.wav	3.67	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_003.wav	7.43	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_004.wav	4.70	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_005.wav	5.89	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_006.wav	5.93	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_007.wav	4.61	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_008.wav	7.21	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_009.wav	4.70	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_010.wav	3.46	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_011.wav	6.96	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_012.wav	4.82	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_013.wav	4.44	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_014.wav	5.12	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_015.wav	6.32	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_016.wav	6.83	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_017.wav	4.27	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_018.wav	5.76	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_019.wav	7.04	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_020.wav	4.74	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_021.wav	9.00	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_022.wav	6.32	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_023.wav	9.99	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_024.wav	6.32	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_025.wav	2.86	It was by the numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_026.wav	2.99	I don't think they can complain about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_027.wav	3.20	I have not seen the term immediate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_028.wav	2.30	My Dad is a hero.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_029.wav	2.30	It is my fault.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_030.wav	3.12	He was the Bill Gates of theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_031.wav	3.29	He added, We have the same desire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_032.wav	3.50	Thirty schools were closed in the Western Isles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_033.wav	3.63	As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_034.wav	2.86	Teachers have been given the offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_035.wav	2.65	We have to win every game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_036.wav	2.56	They also have good neighbours.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_037.wav	2.73	Both sides will be aware of this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_038.wav	2.60	They are not advertised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_039.wav	2.90	I have got a wife to feed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_040.wav	2.90	We are getting people into work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_041.wav	3.03	Will we ever play together again?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_042.wav	2.65	What are the barriers?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_043.wav	3.50	He is keen to stay in public service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_044.wav	2.90	Who are the democrats?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_045.wav	3.03	You had to go and see him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_046.wav	3.07	What did you learn in school today?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_047.wav	2.82	We know we can defend it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_048.wav	2.48	That is not the case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_049.wav	2.72	He met his wife and married in England.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_050.wav	2.20	Instead we were shot in the back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_051.wav	2.39	This isn't a gimmick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_052.wav	2.78	I won't go back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_053.wav	3.76	There is no signature on this document.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_054.wav	2.61	We could not compete with Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_055.wav	2.74	There was mystery back then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_056.wav	3.16	We're all involved in deciding where it goes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_057.wav	3.16	Now it has become a big picture.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_058.wav	2.56	The jury is still out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_059.wav	3.33	Hopefully, they will not go through with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_060.wav	3.07	They have been very lucky with the ice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_061.wav	2.83	We are not the first to be affected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_062.wav	2.65	My players are special.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_063.wav	2.86	We are the gateway to justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_064.wav	2.57	The devil is in the detail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_065.wav	3.25	His handling raises a wider issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_066.wav	2.94	We have got the school holidays on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_067.wav	2.14	We can't go home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_068.wav	2.78	That just wasn't good enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_069.wav	3.67	The working families tax credit is far better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_070.wav	3.03	those who are preparing to give up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_071.wav	3.46	It's really good, as long as we play well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_072.wav	2.99	I feel alive and good today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_073.wav	2.91	She was married with one son.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_074.wav	4.06	There may be some work in construction, but not enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_075.wav	3.16	It was a pretty terrible day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_076.wav	3.03	His track record is impressive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_077.wav	2.86	Clearly it is very disturbing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_078.wav	3.03	It is tough, but possible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_079.wav	2.90	This youngster is so exciting!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_080.wav	2.22	I don't understand it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_081.wav	3.46	The band was good, and it's been a great day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_082.wav	3.59	He was rejected because he had retired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_083.wav	3.84	I just wanted to get off the course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_084.wav	2.99	She was also very brave.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_085.wav	3.55	He promised a final decision within a fortnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_086.wav	3.07	Friday night was a pretty good night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_087.wav	3.84	Things are meant to be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_088.wav	3.54	One year later, he finally decided to act.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_089.wav	3.37	That doesn't just happen, you have to build it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_090.wav	2.73	This is already happening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_091.wav	2.52	We have a rehearsal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_092.wav	3.33	Four had been brought down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_093.wav	3.33	Only he's not as young as he looks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_094.wav	3.59	The matter is under discussion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_095.wav	5.12	Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_096.wav	3.76	Surely this is not supposed to happen?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_097.wav	4.27	This is a defining moment in this parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_098.wav	3.16	They have played their part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_099.wav	3.29	They were unable to revive him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_100.wav	3.72	He confirmed that the document was valid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_101.wav	3.42	In part that reflected the times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_102.wav	2.35	That is not true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_103.wav	3.11	Yes, it was too short a night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_104.wav	2.73	I didn't deserve to be sent off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_106.wav	2.95	We have no excuses.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_107.wav	3.25	- Really you will !
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_108.wav	2.69	The driver was unhurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_109.wav	2.18	Who will pay for this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_110.wav	3.29	This is wrong, but it's what is believed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_111.wav	2.52	You have caught a serial killer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_112.wav	3.25	It's all about money, money, money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_113.wav	2.10	What's the problem?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_114.wav	3.29	Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_115.wav	2.86	The way forward isn't going to be easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_116.wav	2.95	It's the way we go about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_117.wav	2.22	I will be ridiculed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_118.wav	3.12	There's nothing new in that argument.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_119.wav	3.16	This time it was out of the blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_120.wav	3.03	We need to get the right people in.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_121.wav	2.69	It is a great shame.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_122.wav	2.86	We were not going to take that risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_123.wav	3.37	Last night he became one of the hunted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_124.wav	3.46	But that isn't what is worrying the Farmer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_125.wav	3.50	Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_126.wav	3.37	In my opinion, it was not working perfectly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_127.wav	3.25	The truth, of course, is very different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_128.wav	3.46	He has something in common with the Wallabies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_129.wav	3.33	These will take a little time to develop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_130.wav	2.01	I might come back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_131.wav	3.16	He said it was the worst possible result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_132.wav	3.84	But, still, it wasn't working.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_133.wav	2.91	That was my mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_134.wav	4.10	We can play better than that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_135.wav	2.13	My whole family is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_136.wav	3.63	However, everyone should do it once in their life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_137.wav	3.25	A career as a doctor is on hold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_138.wav	4.83	During the communist time they were very privileged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_139.wav	3.46	There has been no delay on government orders.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_140.wav	2.61	I think we can overcome it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_141.wav	2.61	We will be victorious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_142.wav	3.80	The other question is why the scaling down?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_143.wav	2.82	It was the crowning point of my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_144.wav	3.16	But it will be sorted out this week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_145.wav	2.35	It's just a fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_146.wav	2.91	Mr Smith was dismissive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_147.wav	2.77	It was a discussion paper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_148.wav	3.59	My neighbours are horrified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_149.wav	2.90	They will be ready.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_150.wav	4.06	Bin Laden is believed to be left-handed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_151.wav	2.82	He is walking free.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_152.wav	3.16	There is nothing they can't do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_153.wav	3.24	It certainly was a birthday to remember.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_154.wav	3.67	If you can work, you should work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_155.wav	4.31	This was a very tragic accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_156.wav	5.04	THE Paragon Ensemble is back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_157.wav	3.63	If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_158.wav	3.59	It is the voice of the survivors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_159.wav	4.95	The whole thing in general is moving on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_160.wav	2.91	They might also be parlous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_161.wav	4.95	Paterson can afford to be generous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_162.wav	4.01	No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_163.wav	4.78	The other is the existence of male colleagues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_164.wav	3.89	I'm just a piece in the jigsaw.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_165.wav	2.44	It is not an escape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_166.wav	2.78	It feels that the game is off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_167.wav	3.33	He is very confident at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_168.wav	3.46	Well, what can you do?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_169.wav	4.78	It is not the message alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_170.wav	2.74	They will be seen for years to come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_171.wav	3.50	I'm really happy with how things went there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_172.wav	2.86	He will be greatly missed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_173.wav	2.73	Sadly, they don't seem to know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_174.wav	4.52	But is that possible?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_175.wav	4.52	In many ways, that is as important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_176.wav	3.89	I think we're going to make it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_177.wav	2.22	It was really frustrating.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_178.wav	3.07	Clubs can only do so much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_179.wav	3.63	Many other areas are coming up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_180.wav	3.33	It would have very little impact on them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_181.wav	3.46	She didn't tell me anything the night before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_182.wav	3.80	That's the way things are heading.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_183.wav	3.37	We were extremely poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_184.wav	2.95	The parties have no contact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_185.wav	4.18	He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_186.wav	2.99	We are still paying the price for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_187.wav	2.99	It was better than a soap opera.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_188.wav	3.03	There will be no change in government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_189.wav	3.33	I am just grateful he is alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_190.wav	2.73	This is a special place for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_191.wav	4.14	This was a great result for us, a big result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_192.wav	2.52	Our policy is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_193.wav	3.07	This was an hour before the show.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_194.wav	3.55	It is crucial to understand this in context.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_195.wav	3.08	I now know that from memory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_196.wav	4.36	Another one said the couple came from Inverness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_197.wav	3.46	We expect a full house on the night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_198.wav	2.86	He invented the language.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_199.wav	3.03	We want to play at the worlds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_200.wav	3.07	We need to know more about her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_201.wav	3.25	I went away to recover fully.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_202.wav	2.56	Ownership was the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_203.wav	2.74	It makes a huge difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_204.wav	3.25	The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_205.wav	3.54	It's not a new device.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_206.wav	3.67	Like everything in Scotland, it takes time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_207.wav	2.99	Six years is too long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_208.wav	2.94	They are not a set of options.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_209.wav	3.46	It's a very important and beautiful day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_210.wav	3.54	If only the problems concerned the players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_211.wav	3.03	But it was money well spent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_212.wav	3.20	That's the most important thing for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_213.wav	3.33	At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_214.wav	3.16	No decision has yet been made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_215.wav	2.56	I have had a lovely summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_216.wav	2.69	Which is fair enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_217.wav	2.65	He took over our lives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_218.wav	3.29	The problem is worse in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_219.wav	2.86	This is a historic agreement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_220.wav	3.29	He had worked there for only two days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_221.wav	2.48	We just want them home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_222.wav	4.23	His was the best performance of the day, after all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_223.wav	2.39	I was happily surprised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_224.wav	2.27	It may not even be possible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_225.wav	2.78	I think it is a scandal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_226.wav	3.12	Perhaps it was just as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_227.wav	2.69	That, though, was then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_228.wav	2.27	I grew up with them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_229.wav	2.61	It was the train coming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_230.wav	2.99	I would have the hammer in the crowd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_231.wav	3.80	We are pursuing legal action against the government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_232.wav	2.73	Perhaps that was their mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_233.wav	2.65	We've never seen so many.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_234.wav	3.50	The way forward is working with other disciplines.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_235.wav	3.54	I am very, very happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_236.wav	2.56	The case was continued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_237.wav	2.69	That is important for the club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_238.wav	2.61	He is doing the right things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_239.wav	2.56	Blood samples were taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_240.wav	2.91	Now he is in charge of this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_241.wav	2.90	They want to play in the World Cup.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_242.wav	2.82	He was embarrassed about what he did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_243.wav	3.29	This is excellent news for the workforce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_244.wav	3.25	The home team also had their moments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_245.wav	3.03	Haven't been so lucky since.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_246.wav	2.61	He is under no illusions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_247.wav	2.27	It got no better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_248.wav	2.65	Some were close to tears.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_249.wav	2.56	It has become a way of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_250.wav	2.95	They seem to turn up for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_251.wav	3.33	That is a matter for the Scottish Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_252.wav	3.24	Now we are back on top of Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_253.wav	3.71	Now the show is for public consumption.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_254.wav	2.86	I want to create events.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_255.wav	3.54	I wish it wasn't so, but it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_256.wav	3.24	The old manager, he didn't like me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_257.wav	3.20	We had a court hearing in London yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_258.wav	3.46	The ministers are now to make their decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_259.wav	2.74	It was like being in prison.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_260.wav	2.69	I think it was his parents.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_261.wav	3.12	That is very important to people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_262.wav	2.56	I certainly hope not.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_263.wav	3.46	This is a dream come true for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_264.wav	3.63	No other country has ever won this tournament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_265.wav	2.22	There he goes again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_266.wav	3.67	However, there could be more bad weather to come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_267.wav	2.22	I feel pretty good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_268.wav	2.60	It's got to come from me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_269.wav	2.82	There were moments of humour too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_270.wav	2.65	He has a wealth of experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_271.wav	3.29	Don't you think it was a fine performance?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_272.wav	2.77	It happens from time to time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_273.wav	3.63	All my family are in Scotland, from Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_274.wav	2.35	They were too hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_275.wav	3.29	This is not a message from ministers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_276.wav	2.60	We have been very patient.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_277.wav	2.48	I don't take that view.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_278.wav	3.29	They have a car and cannot afford another.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_279.wav	2.86	My only concern is for my children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_280.wav	2.57	This is welcome news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_281.wav	3.12	The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_282.wav	3.08	We just wish they had done so before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_283.wav	2.10	It was a virus.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_284.wav	2.95	The rest, of course, is history.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_285.wav	2.52	They chose the latter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_286.wav	2.31	That was not the norm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_287.wav	3.67	I've not said anything to them, they know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_288.wav	3.20	It is giving out the wrong message.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_289.wav	3.07	I feel it is very irrational.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_290.wav	3.03	We were used to being in control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_291.wav	3.03	He's had a lot of injury problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_292.wav	2.99	Brady lost to Sullivan one hole.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_293.wav	3.42	It happened again, and again, and again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_294.wav	1.92	Does it matter?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_295.wav	2.52	She thought she was going to die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_296.wav	2.61	Were they under-age?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_297.wav	2.52	You are going to go to jail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_298.wav	3.03	It is a very worrying report.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_299.wav	3.37	I started it, but then forgot all about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_300.wav	2.52	My mind was made up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_301.wav	3.41	It was an ongoing exercise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_302.wav	2.69	I would love to see it back there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_303.wav	2.73	He then did just that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_304.wav	2.35	He should have won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_305.wav	3.12	He could hardly have been in greater demand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_306.wav	2.22	Who can predict?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_307.wav	2.99	It was all very proper and civilised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_308.wav	3.25	I've played them all in the Champions League.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_309.wav	2.35	Then you see it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_310.wav	2.52	And it had been a marvellous occasion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_311.wav	2.65	We don't believe anything anymore.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_312.wav	2.99	Either system could have prevented the crash.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_313.wav	3.12	Here, the fans have been fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_314.wav	2.14	There is good quality.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_315.wav	3.76	For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_316.wav	3.88	But these things are happening now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_317.wav	3.07	He will be really pleased about this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_318.wav	3.37	He had no access to the database.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_319.wav	3.20	They were not up to the required standard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_320.wav	3.24	He also seems to have been around forever.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_321.wav	3.58	However, it has had only a limited uptake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_322.wav	3.59	At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_323.wav	3.42	Others are expected to do so soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_324.wav	3.29	They were impressive against France.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_325.wav	3.93	Seven people were already in custody in France.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_326.wav	3.33	I played well but missed a few chances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_327.wav	2.90	Our approach will be different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_328.wav	2.69	It's my initial background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_329.wav	3.46	The board is currently resolving its differences.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_330.wav	2.69	They're just a nonsense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_331.wav	3.67	That has not been the case, as we now know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_332.wav	4.40	He also called in at another farm.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_333.wav	2.35	But he seemed to enjoy the challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_334.wav	2.39	He will go a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_335.wav	4.95	Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_336.wav	2.05	I lost a part of me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_337.wav	3.50	It's so much more fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_338.wav	5.68	That's just the kind of thing we have.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_339.wav	2.01	It's getting to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_340.wav	2.91	So we talked about that for a bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_341.wav	4.14	But he has strong links to Labour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_342.wav	2.14	I am proud of my team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_343.wav	1.92	I am a doctor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_344.wav	4.35	Secondly, there are other options for patients.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_345.wav	3.33	It will carry on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_346.wav	2.48	Our season is not over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_347.wav	2.77	I am not retiring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_348.wav	3.33	Money is not everything in life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_349.wav	3.42	She kept him on a string.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_350.wav	2.99	It will make a big difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_351.wav	2.95	There was no basis for their arrest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_352.wav	3.37	This latter suggestion is very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_353.wav	4.14	The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_354.wav	3.03	The Government has listened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_355.wav	3.20	It's only tackling congestion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_356.wav	3.46	That is a trend which will be encouraged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_357.wav	2.78	It's too horrible to think.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_358.wav	2.44	It can be frightening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_359.wav	2.65	He was, but only just.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_360.wav	3.33	It may be his last for a while, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_361.wav	1.07	Further details are expected later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_362.wav	2.56	What's wrong with that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_363.wav	3.37	You will never forget the clutching horror.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_364.wav	2.43	Off with their heads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_365.wav	3.25	I believe she was elected unopposed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_366.wav	2.56	We are not asking for the moon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_367.wav	3.38	Now we see the impact of global politics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_368.wav	2.52	The pain is still acute.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_369.wav	2.73	This was not the show for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_370.wav	2.91	It is a very big problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_371.wav	2.73	Frustration is not the word.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_372.wav	3.03	The police have to act to help them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_373.wav	2.09	The cause is just.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_374.wav	3.29	It may be down, but New York is not out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_375.wav	2.31	Our message is getting through.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_376.wav	2.35	But what lies ahead?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_377.wav	2.56	She makes me so happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_378.wav	2.82	They promised to fight the plans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_379.wav	2.73	My heart is not so sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_380.wav	2.22	I am happy for her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_381.wav	3.03	Finally, he paid for the movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_382.wav	2.82	They were just too good for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_383.wav	2.73	He was the architect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_384.wav	3.80	This should include procedures for personal imports.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_385.wav	2.91	It's a fantastic achievement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_386.wav	3.33	Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_387.wav	3.72	Police are appealing for witnesses to the accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_388.wav	3.12	He, too, was not satisfied.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_389.wav	2.65	It's easy to see why.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_390.wav	2.22	But it didn't happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_391.wav	2.91	All were believed to be adults.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_392.wav	2.69	This is the last straw.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_393.wav	2.65	The research was my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_394.wav	3.29	I am so, so, so lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_395.wav	2.73	What is it about this series?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_396.wav	2.43	You read it right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_397.wav	3.41	They would have been forgiven for doing so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_398.wav	2.78	I only wanted to give her a fright.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_399.wav	2.82	Where does it come from?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_400.wav	1.97	You find it bizarre?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_401.wav	3.80	I am very excited about this season.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_402.wav	3.93	It has proved a double whammy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_403.wav	3.33	Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_404.wav	2.99	It should be a great game, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_405.wav	2.82	But is he?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_406.wav	2.69	So it's a daily struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_407.wav	4.14	But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_408.wav	3.67	If it's not, they didn't go far enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_409.wav	3.67	Ministers are not involved in these discussions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_410.wav	3.46	Everyone has his share of trouble.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_411.wav	4.36	You need a licence to run a pub.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_412.wav	4.18	Everything else is second.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_413.wav	3.84	I am not sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_414.wav	2.78	This is a successful outcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_415.wav	3.54	His first album was a hit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_416.wav	3.25	The salary changes are long overdue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_417.wav	2.86	The plane was shaking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_418.wav	2.82	It was visibly on fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_419.wav	2.77	What's it for, after all?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_420.wav	2.77	We will be pleased to talk to them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_421.wav	3.42	A number of people could not speak English.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_422.wav	2.69	They have got off with murder.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_423.wav	2.52	I'm going to take it further.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p351\p351_424.wav	2.65	I kept going for her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_001.wav	2.18	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_002.wav	3.63	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_003.wav	6.49	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_004.wav	6.53	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_005.wav	6.53	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_006.wav	7.30	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_007.wav	6.23	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_008.wav	7.98	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_009.wav	5.17	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_010.wav	3.24	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_011.wav	7.34	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_012.wav	5.21	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_013.wav	5.08	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_014.wav	5.12	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_015.wav	6.40	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_016.wav	6.87	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_017.wav	4.18	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_018.wav	5.97	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_019.wav	7.00	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_020.wav	4.48	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_021.wav	8.66	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_022.wav	6.87	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_023.wav	12.81	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_024.wav	7.55	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_025.wav	3.25	You can never take a win for granted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_026.wav	2.56	My conscience is not clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_027.wav	1.84	Is that it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_028.wav	2.26	You have been warned.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_029.wav	2.39	You are not allowed to do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_030.wav	2.56	That depends on Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_031.wav	2.52	There are two problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_032.wav	3.20	Lose, and they would be ridiculed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_033.wav	3.29	It's something which is very important to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_034.wav	2.86	For once he was wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_035.wav	2.69	He would not have to explain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_036.wav	3.33	I want to deliver a learning society.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_037.wav	3.63	We are just happy that hasn't happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_038.wav	3.16	I had to be into it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_039.wav	2.65	I'm so grateful for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_040.wav	2.82	It's not been a good year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_041.wav	3.97	A similar exercise is expected in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_042.wav	3.16	I have no intention of resigning today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_043.wav	2.22	That has now gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_044.wav	3.88	Donald is genuine in trying to be inclusive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_045.wav	2.95	This will take up to nine months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_046.wav	2.44	And maybe they have.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_047.wav	4.10	Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_048.wav	2.31	Is he conscious?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_049.wav	2.48	But we are confident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_050.wav	3.12	It is like a football team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_051.wav	2.52	When he came to see me on Monday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_052.wav	2.65	That's a concern to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_053.wav	2.56	She said she was really sorry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_054.wav	2.14	That will be important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_055.wav	2.99	But here it is also very bad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_056.wav	2.56	That view has not altered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_057.wav	3.72	It was very full anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_058.wav	3.16	As for the warning, it was not needed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_059.wav	3.59	The incidents are not believed to be linked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_060.wav	2.86	But there is no easy option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_061.wav	2.61	I can't believe she is dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_062.wav	2.43	No person was charged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_063.wav	2.35	But it would say that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_064.wav	3.25	Most of the works are small in scale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_065.wav	3.16	He was pronounced dead at the scene.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_066.wav	2.78	Only the bomber was killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_067.wav	2.90	But he just carried on anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_068.wav	3.93	Nor was it a game without its lessons.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_069.wav	3.12	It was that kind of afternoon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_070.wav	3.29	His presence was very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_071.wav	2.44	What happens next?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_072.wav	3.12	They couldn't believe what had happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_073.wav	3.20	The bombing begins in five minutes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_074.wav	2.48	That took two weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_075.wav	2.31	It's worth it, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_076.wav	3.97	That perhaps is behind the problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_077.wav	3.07	I have to hand it to the bank.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_078.wav	2.78	The question was simple enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_079.wav	2.56	The voters rejected us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_080.wav	2.56	There was a definite prejudice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_081.wav	3.20	Nothing is going right at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_082.wav	2.77	We never publicise it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_083.wav	2.60	You will be very welcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_084.wav	3.88	His musicals were very much of their time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_085.wav	3.42	He became enchanted with the process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_086.wav	3.21	This year the exercise is being repeated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_087.wav	2.86	It seems very odd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_088.wav	2.60	They couldn't keep it together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_089.wav	2.95	We discovered that for ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_090.wav	3.76	We will continue to provide support for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_091.wav	3.46	I've always been very taken by the drink.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_092.wav	2.18	It was looking bad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_093.wav	2.99	That's what makes it interesting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_094.wav	2.78	It's nice to be involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_095.wav	2.26	It's not a game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_096.wav	2.69	Buildings are about people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_097.wav	2.77	There is much work to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_098.wav	3.50	The release attracted little attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_099.wav	3.07	It was the dreaded sentence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_100.wav	2.69	I have never considered it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_101.wav	3.03	It is not in the public interest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_102.wav	2.05	They had been forced to walk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_103.wav	2.60	It is harder than you think.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_104.wav	2.01	The call was ignored.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_105.wav	2.30	I am looking forward to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_106.wav	3.16	Consumers will also benefit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_107.wav	2.86	That would be even more disastrous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_108.wav	2.60	We opened up and everything was gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_109.wav	2.56	It is looking very special.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_110.wav	3.16	They offered to make an investment into it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_111.wav	2.43	People were hitting the floor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_112.wav	3.33	She was close to suicide at one stage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_113.wav	1.97	They took a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_114.wav	3.80	Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_115.wav	2.69	It has no place in football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_116.wav	3.03	It is frustrating that we cannot do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_117.wav	2.48	This is a classic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_118.wav	2.05	He played it like a veteran.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_119.wav	2.48	I have spoken to head office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_120.wav	2.99	I'm not thinking about anyone else.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_121.wav	2.14	They will run a mile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_122.wav	3.16	When she went off it was quite amazing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_123.wav	3.20	Britain has never had it so good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_124.wav	3.42	So many people will be affected by this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_125.wav	3.08	It was all very good stuff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_126.wav	1.75	Or was it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_127.wav	3.25	We are under no illusions about this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_128.wav	2.09	But they are a good team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_129.wav	2.69	We have a long way to go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_130.wav	2.82	I hope it has helped the prisoners.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_131.wav	3.76	Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_132.wav	3.33	I knew that we needed to get out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_133.wav	2.82	I had a train to catch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_134.wav	3.16	And this game is all about belief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_135.wav	2.31	I am ready for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_136.wav	2.69	It is a fantasy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_137.wav	3.29	The only safe investment is cash.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_138.wav	2.52	That's the way they are.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_139.wav	3.16	Elections would follow in about two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_140.wav	2.60	We are trying to be realistic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_141.wav	2.73	That was the theory.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_142.wav	2.14	Or so it seemed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_143.wav	2.52	Now we look forward to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_144.wav	2.27	That was worth it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_145.wav	2.73	What's it going to be then?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_146.wav	2.57	Who was being affected?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_147.wav	2.78	Our players are exhausted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_148.wav	2.52	It is deeply frustrating.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_149.wav	3.63	He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_150.wav	3.42	We've had an enjoyable adventure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_151.wav	2.74	This has been carried out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_152.wav	2.44	Our time is up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_153.wav	2.77	It was a moment of madness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_154.wav	3.12	But other Ministers are not convinced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_155.wav	2.52	First meeting was next week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_156.wav	3.46	No, we were not exactly favourites.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_157.wav	3.80	Conditions were very difficult for the players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_158.wav	3.89	This solution is not being considered in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_159.wav	3.03	I didn't think we deserved to go out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_160.wav	3.12	However, we will have to wait and see.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_161.wav	2.61	I told them they shouldn't say that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_162.wav	2.44	I don't know how they do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_163.wav	2.39	Little is known about them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_164.wav	3.07	It is a new company for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_165.wav	2.52	We're very unhappy about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_166.wav	2.26	A good actor doesn't think.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_167.wav	2.95	But the action is about to be restarted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_168.wav	2.39	It was extremely difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_169.wav	2.60	It is about the script for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_170.wav	2.82	I have a good feeling about this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_171.wav	2.48	And the results were impressive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_172.wav	2.48	The next game is today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_173.wav	2.65	Hopefully it will be a good day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_174.wav	2.86	I was a silly bastard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_175.wav	3.37	There is an ongoing problem with this company.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_176.wav	2.18	The process will start tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_177.wav	2.99	Was the punishment excessive?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_178.wav	3.41	The police have an awful lot to explain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_179.wav	2.95	That's when you hope to take advantage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_180.wav	2.44	I could easy do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_181.wav	2.26	We are really impressed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_182.wav	3.20	I try to be clear in the narrative.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_183.wav	2.01	You have to wait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_184.wav	3.16	I did not see anything to begin with.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_185.wav	2.73	It's their moment of choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_186.wav	2.78	I certainly do not agree with that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_187.wav	3.25	It was a disaster of a race.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_188.wav	3.37	Only one person can claim the credit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_189.wav	3.03	Maintain the highest standards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_190.wav	1.97	What could we do?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_191.wav	2.44	O Neill has delivered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_192.wav	2.78	But there was no going back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_193.wav	2.82	There are some good people in there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_194.wav	2.73	But it won't make a difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_195.wav	2.74	I'm not going to blame the band.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_196.wav	2.78	I think that he got the message.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_197.wav	2.91	Here it was very subdued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_198.wav	2.48	Stardom is a funny thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_199.wav	4.31	They are protesting, but they know it cannot go on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_200.wav	3.84	The atmosphere in the dressing room is superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_201.wav	2.48	I sincerely hope not.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_202.wav	2.90	I'm really looking forward to that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_203.wav	3.41	She would say he was still the best.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_204.wav	2.99	It is dangerous and it is a lie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_205.wav	3.16	We didn't, and it worked for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_206.wav	3.29	No-one has used it since then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_207.wav	2.99	The baby was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_208.wav	3.07	That remains the unanswered question.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_209.wav	2.52	Everyone is too upset to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_210.wav	2.65	They tried to give her advice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_211.wav	2.73	We should have no more problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_212.wav	3.07	Pensions are a long-term investment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_213.wav	2.91	An announcement is expected soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_214.wav	2.48	It was one of those things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_215.wav	2.48	I can understand that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_216.wav	3.25	But sometimes it was even worse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_217.wav	2.95	We had to work hard for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_218.wav	2.48	That's a big reduction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_219.wav	2.82	There will be good prospects ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_220.wav	2.22	I was pleased about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_221.wav	2.39	That has not changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_222.wav	2.48	It's a creative energy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_223.wav	2.61	We are not conducting the review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_224.wav	2.65	It just never comes together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_225.wav	3.80	The club has never won it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_226.wav	2.99	His leader wanted to celebrate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_227.wav	3.08	So it was at Easter Road.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_228.wav	2.86	It will be a huge difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_229.wav	3.33	Labour will almost certainly remain in control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_230.wav	3.59	The characters are always the first attraction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_231.wav	2.69	We've got better players here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_232.wav	3.29	We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_233.wav	1.84	This is wonderful news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_234.wav	3.20	So what's it all about?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_235.wav	2.99	I think he was lost for words.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_236.wav	3.41	In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_237.wav	3.03	I want to celebrate the World Cup.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_238.wav	2.82	This is a historic occasion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_239.wav	3.46	No-one expected that their parents would stay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_240.wav	2.18	And what happens?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_241.wav	2.52	It is all very upbeat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_242.wav	2.78	I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_243.wav	2.78	We're looking for unity in the council.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_244.wav	4.18	The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_245.wav	2.82	We deserved the draw.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_246.wav	2.95	Just one of those things, we suppose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_247.wav	2.52	It's up to the defence team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_248.wav	2.56	No one was injured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_249.wav	2.22	We have had our debate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_250.wav	2.18	It is part of his game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_251.wav	3.20	Did he just want to be on telly?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_252.wav	2.39	But it was too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_253.wav	2.39	I didn't see the point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_254.wav	2.56	It seems a shame to leave it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_255.wav	2.65	Who would have thought it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_256.wav	2.94	They were all on a mission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_257.wav	3.24	Human beings are always the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_258.wav	2.31	You will gain from that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_259.wav	2.65	It makes me feel difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_260.wav	2.52	We couldn't believe it at first.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_261.wav	3.89	The distinction is also supported by doctors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_262.wav	2.73	He could still be President.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_263.wav	3.12	It can take a long time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_264.wav	2.56	I don't intend to do so now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_265.wav	2.22	There is no answer to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_266.wav	2.94	He was pleased with his display.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_267.wav	2.94	The first time you read a play.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_268.wav	3.63	There was no let-up for the minnows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_269.wav	4.18	The bottom line is that this must stop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_270.wav	2.95	He is having a nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_271.wav	2.31	That was six years ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_272.wav	2.73	Players have to accept this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_273.wav	2.65	He is completely committed to us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_274.wav	3.42	Neither had the public.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_275.wav	3.84	It disappeared into the cup.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_276.wav	2.44	They might well be right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_277.wav	3.03	I have no further comment to make.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_278.wav	2.78	The warning is timely.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_279.wav	2.31	Those were the days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_280.wav	2.90	The joint bid is still on course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_281.wav	3.07	A press conference is about politics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_282.wav	3.12	It was important to bring them all together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_283.wav	3.76	We didn't play well and will certainly improve.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_284.wav	3.07	They tend to be female and retired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_285.wav	3.63	These things happen in football but shouldn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_286.wav	3.46	It looks as though he will be right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_287.wav	3.03	We know the fight is going to happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_288.wav	3.46	I have played well the past two days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_289.wav	2.73	Is it on a building site?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_290.wav	2.05	That is the key.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_291.wav	2.52	We've been here before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_292.wav	2.94	I am in a good position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_293.wav	3.03	I have never been unemployed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_294.wav	3.07	We are in it for the long-term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_295.wav	2.43	But it didn't bother me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_296.wav	2.31	I believe it will happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_297.wav	2.52	And Michael was just great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_298.wav	2.05	He did it well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_299.wav	3.12	Why have you decided to get married?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_300.wav	2.01	Is it all real?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_301.wav	2.09	He will be missed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_302.wav	3.37	I would not descend to that level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_303.wav	2.73	They were not at the property yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_304.wav	2.60	We will not tolerate it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_305.wav	2.18	I'm really proud of her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_306.wav	2.27	What does this mean?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_307.wav	2.26	They are not falling now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_308.wav	2.74	We are not physical at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_309.wav	2.69	Have we not been here before?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_310.wav	2.05	I've been waiting a long time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_311.wav	3.29	The meaning is very profound and complex.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_312.wav	3.03	You just have to get on with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_313.wav	3.08	The response from everyone was wonderful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_314.wav	2.73	And that match was played in June.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_315.wav	3.54	We are looking for Scotland to be inspired.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_316.wav	2.95	I don't mean in a frightening way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_317.wav	3.46	He is a sort of a mystery figure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_318.wav	2.39	I have learned a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_319.wav	2.35	It won't be their last.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_320.wav	2.52	You've got to have both sides.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_321.wav	2.73	He has yet to receive a reply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_322.wav	2.65	It has been only average.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_323.wav	2.56	He should be worried about me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_324.wav	2.78	Hopefully, it will be good enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_325.wav	2.95	For me, any manager is good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_326.wav	3.46	Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_327.wav	2.09	That was the gimmick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_328.wav	2.90	He refused to name the survivors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_329.wav	2.48	He has changed my life forever.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_330.wav	2.18	I have no idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_331.wav	2.73	This plan is all about respect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_332.wav	2.61	I don't think he played his best.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_333.wav	2.73	Pakistan denied the report.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_334.wav	2.69	It will be up to the government.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_335.wav	2.35	That is a tragedy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_336.wav	2.01	I am very happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_337.wav	2.48	A child is not a product.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_338.wav	2.48	But this is nonsense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_339.wav	3.37	You can't get the experience in Austria.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_340.wav	2.39	I'm going to miss it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_341.wav	2.77	There will be no backing down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_342.wav	2.69	The atmosphere was excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_343.wav	2.86	That must have had an effect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_344.wav	3.12	They have brought in the replacement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_345.wav	3.54	How did it all come about?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_346.wav	2.69	We are working so hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_347.wav	2.78	One was a lawyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_348.wav	3.72	Our position is extremely simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_349.wav	2.48	Where did that finish?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_350.wav	3.67	I suppose it is quite exciting really.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_351.wav	4.10	The most important thing was to win today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_352.wav	2.99	Golf is not like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_353.wav	2.94	This is a moment to seize.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_354.wav	2.43	I would not do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_355.wav	3.33	Lots of them haven't recovered that far.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_356.wav	2.56	They said that they stood by their statement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_357.wav	3.71	That is a trend which will be encouraged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_358.wav	3.29	That has to be allowed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_359.wav	3.08	He has never let them down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_360.wav	3.33	There was no-one of the required standard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_361.wav	3.03	That would be very good for Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_362.wav	3.67	It's something he has worked very hard on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_363.wav	4.31	It is time to fight a decisive battle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_364.wav	3.20	That gives it a spirit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_365.wav	2.48	She has never been back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_366.wav	2.94	It will set the tone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_367.wav	2.65	They are not going away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_368.wav	3.03	Having done it, he was asked again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_369.wav	2.05	I think he will.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_370.wav	3.03	The package is a changing one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_371.wav	2.91	I'm working on that one, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_372.wav	2.95	Frankly, that's not good enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_373.wav	1.67	Or is it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_374.wav	2.18	What's the difference?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_375.wav	2.90	The whole family was in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_376.wav	2.95	But everywhere the problems are the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_377.wav	3.55	Craig is a major concern for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_378.wav	3.16	The problems began a long time ago.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_379.wav	2.14	It meant a lot to us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_380.wav	2.90	What other retailer would do this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_381.wav	3.25	Other musicians were found in retirement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_382.wav	2.39	This country has many challenges.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_383.wav	2.48	Their families are gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_384.wav	2.69	IS Tony Blair on drugs?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_385.wav	2.01	I didn't do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_386.wav	2.56	They are with their father.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_387.wav	2.35	They're all doing it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_388.wav	3.54	I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_389.wav	2.86	No, they are not the same thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_390.wav	3.20	In football it is not always the case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_391.wav	2.90	Sometimes we find a person.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_392.wav	2.69	It is a natural reaction.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_393.wav	3.63	I am in a very difficult position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_394.wav	2.95	I had to win this race.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_395.wav	2.99	They could have been told in advance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_396.wav	1.67	And what do we have?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_397.wav	2.09	It is a relief.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_398.wav	3.20	The boat was fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_399.wav	3.20	These were the edited highlights.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_400.wav	1.60	That is the difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_401.wav	1.96	You will need it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_402.wav	3.12	There is so much at stake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_403.wav	2.69	It has great potential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_404.wav	2.35	They had three children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_405.wav	2.99	It was all too little, too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_406.wav	3.80	Still, it is a very good result for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_407.wav	2.61	And he's not alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_408.wav	2.60	What was all that about?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_409.wav	2.60	What's the problem with change?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_410.wav	2.52	I intend to end it on a high.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_411.wav	2.99	What she can't have is the money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_412.wav	2.31	I thought they played well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_413.wav	2.22	This is not the end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_414.wav	3.03	And they went on to win the title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_415.wav	3.20	Now, she will not be running at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_416.wav	2.39	It's not an impression.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_417.wav	2.65	This was great for our sport.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_418.wav	4.01	There's no place to hide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_419.wav	2.52	I don't think they are too serious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_420.wav	2.35	Tiger is the exception.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_421.wav	2.82	There was no happy ending.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_422.wav	2.65	They need time to think.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_423.wav	2.01	It's unfair on her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p360\p360_424.wav	3.42	As for Owen, class is permanent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_001.wav	2.27	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_002.wav	3.76	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_003.wav	7.17	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_004.wav	4.65	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_005.wav	6.06	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_006.wav	6.10	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_007.wav	4.99	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_008.wav	7.34	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_009.wav	4.91	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_010.wav	2.78	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_011.wav	6.36	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_012.wav	5.12	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_013.wav	4.48	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_014.wav	4.74	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_015.wav	5.89	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_016.wav	7.30	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_017.wav	3.55	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_018.wav	5.12	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_019.wav	7.81	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_020.wav	4.40	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_021.wav	9.18	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_022.wav	6.66	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_023.wav	10.71	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_024.wav	6.44	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_025.wav	2.44	Something has to be done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_026.wav	2.77	That is where the damage has been done.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_027.wav	3.12	He may not need to force that message.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_028.wav	3.07	These decisions are not simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_029.wav	2.78	The results were very clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_030.wav	2.69	We must convince the citizens.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_031.wav	2.86	I decided it is going to be William.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_032.wav	2.60	But we need to keep it there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_033.wav	2.99	It is a case of taking a risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_034.wav	2.82	I am really ready for it now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_035.wav	2.19	He was jailed for four years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_036.wav	2.65	We felt it was sufficient.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_037.wav	2.90	This decision is folly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_038.wav	2.39	And this was well known?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_039.wav	2.86	It took two minutes to respond.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_040.wav	3.03	Why you did it will never be known.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_041.wav	2.35	He was in his element.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_042.wav	2.82	That means an extra two years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_043.wav	2.31	So, we have to go back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_044.wav	2.14	I'm sure he does.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_045.wav	3.20	He was found again almost a year later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_046.wav	2.48	The answer was wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_047.wav	2.13	They need to be helped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_048.wav	2.95	It is all starting to come together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_049.wav	3.71	I am the fastest player on the course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_050.wav	2.94	It is the tip of the iceberg.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_051.wav	2.86	They were taken to prove a point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_052.wav	3.63	It doesn't have to be in Inverness.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_053.wav	2.72	It is an important step forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_054.wav	3.08	A final agreement has not yet been completed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_055.wav	3.16	And they removed a Borderer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_056.wav	2.44	That is the way it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_057.wav	2.61	That was something else.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_058.wav	2.86	This resulted in the following.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_059.wav	2.48	I want to deal with this stuff.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_060.wav	3.67	We will be patient but we will win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_061.wav	3.12	As good as they come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_062.wav	2.48	It is not for me to say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_063.wav	2.60	For that much we must be grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_064.wav	2.27	But the law is very clear on this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_065.wav	2.94	I thought it was quite a positive result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_066.wav	2.44	But we are very near.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_067.wav	3.84	Nobody else is at risk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_068.wav	2.69	We are not going to back off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_069.wav	2.82	He said it was for sale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_070.wav	2.95	We have a strong team at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_071.wav	3.08	This is a dream come true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_072.wav	3.46	The problem is not confined to the UK.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_073.wav	2.69	It is on the news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_074.wav	2.65	They said there was nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_075.wav	2.35	They were looking for things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_076.wav	4.65	I've got to be better than that   Quite.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_077.wav	3.20	I wouldn't give them a grade.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_078.wav	2.31	As it should be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_079.wav	2.95	We have never been short of volunteers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_080.wav	1.97	But who is it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_081.wav	2.73	Kenny Miller might come through.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_082.wav	3.29	Workers will now be balloted on the offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_083.wav	2.52	It just isn't there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_084.wav	2.39	Drama is not one of them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_085.wav	2.31	And we have a singer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_086.wav	2.73	It was exactly four months away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_087.wav	3.50	This is a personal decision for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_088.wav	2.78	It's just a failing service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_089.wav	2.74	We all want to be left alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_090.wav	1.97	I was saying, No.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_091.wav	2.78	Where are they?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_092.wav	3.93	I am delighted to hear this news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_093.wav	1.79	I knew him a little.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_094.wav	2.78	They just have a go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_095.wav	4.01	If it's going in, it goes in.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_096.wav	3.03	Nobody called me to explain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_097.wav	3.42	You didn't get a modified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_098.wav	3.59	What kind of person is he?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_099.wav	3.72	Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_100.wav	3.80	What has changed since then?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_101.wav	3.29	He knows he is good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_102.wav	3.03	I welcome the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_103.wav	4.01	It could take some time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_104.wav	2.77	The girls are so lucky to be alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_105.wav	3.55	It may be tomorrow - but it may be later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_106.wav	2.95	I've done a lot in that building.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_107.wav	3.97	Music is all consuming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_108.wav	2.95	The results are very positive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_109.wav	3.50	Talk of a crisis is absurd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_110.wav	4.61	Which is where we come in.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_111.wav	2.35	I'm not looking forward to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_112.wav	4.23	Next league matches, Aberdeen - Dundee United.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_113.wav	3.42	He is a pro.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_114.wav	6.45	They have to tell it as it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_115.wav	3.29	This could easily have been another tragedy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_116.wav	3.37	You should enjoy the day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_117.wav	3.12	He was taken ill in his office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_118.wav	3.85	We couldn't get enough of it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_119.wav	3.37	Cost is a factor, but not the only one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_120.wav	2.43	I am not very pleased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_121.wav	2.61	It is just a statement of fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_122.wav	3.16	It was on my mind a little bit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_123.wav	4.06	I will just have to be patient.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_124.wav	3.12	I didn't think about it again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_125.wav	2.22	And if they fail?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_126.wav	3.71	He has gone through the process before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_127.wav	4.27	Social workers are on stand-by to help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_128.wav	3.59	We've always had something to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_129.wav	2.14	How do you take them away?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_130.wav	3.16	It will be released in October.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_132.wav	2.99	That got me out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_133.wav	3.07	IT is called a killing in the trade.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_134.wav	1.86	It's a matter for the Committee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_135.wav	3.12	It will have to ratify the deal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_136.wav	3.93	I've never seen anything like it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_137.wav	2.09	It was highly successful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_138.wav	2.95	We needed someone and we now have him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_139.wav	4.01	It has to find out what went wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_140.wav	3.37	Only one was from Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_141.wav	3.84	I'm sure he will be aware of it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_142.wav	3.97	Until you hit the big games.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_143.wav	3.33	They received no money under the merger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_144.wav	3.50	It was a big departure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_145.wav	2.86	She has never mentioned it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_146.wav	2.56	I want my mum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_147.wav	3.16	It seems to have been an own goal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_148.wav	3.07	Or someone wants to say something different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_149.wav	3.08	There are no second chances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_150.wav	3.16	And it was great for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_151.wav	3.16	I am extremely sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_152.wav	3.33	This series is for real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_153.wav	3.55	It has still to be recovered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_154.wav	2.82	The conclusion is the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_155.wav	2.86	I wish they would commit to us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_156.wav	2.95	The driver just insulted me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_157.wav	3.59	Something has to be put in place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_158.wav	3.25	Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_159.wav	2.44	It's a mixture of everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_160.wav	4.36	That is the sensible outcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_161.wav	2.82	You can see the appeal of running away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_162.wav	2.95	This means a lot of hard decisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_163.wav	2.27	That comes at a cost.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_164.wav	2.56	And so did the rest of her team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_165.wav	2.78	He tells the truth and that's important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_166.wav	3.20	Those are difficult decisions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_167.wav	2.99	The omens are not good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_168.wav	2.39	The game was there to be won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_169.wav	2.56	Then there's the casting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_170.wav	2.43	There is no signature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_171.wav	2.35	We can't go on like this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_172.wav	3.03	It is a very demanding course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_173.wav	0.85	Can he do it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_174.wav	3.21	The quality of life is difficult for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_175.wav	2.31	I've won the British.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_176.wav	2.82	If they wish to go, they can go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_177.wav	3.25	However, it was a different story in the final.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_178.wav	2.35	I was just aghast.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_179.wav	2.57	They get money for it now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_180.wav	2.22	I could have been offended.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_181.wav	2.18	That's not the way to think.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_182.wav	1.84	I can see it now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_183.wav	2.86	Then everyone must consider their future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_184.wav	2.35	There was nothing she could do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_185.wav	2.26	We want to be part of it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_186.wav	2.61	It was a bit of a shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_187.wav	2.01	It's not long enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_188.wav	2.29	This is positive and welcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_189.wav	2.86	Now he is back on top again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_190.wav	2.61	Actors like to be in the centre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_191.wav	2.43	Anything less will not do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_192.wav	2.39	Failure is not an option.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_193.wav	3.29	That is clearly not happening fast enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_194.wav	3.29	We were not consulted regarding this appointment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_195.wav	2.01	You look at that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_196.wav	1.84	They will be very physical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_197.wav	2.73	It has been well worth it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_198.wav	2.18	It was just a feeling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_199.wav	2.39	People are trying to run away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_200.wav	3.29	On the face of it, this is excellent news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_201.wav	2.65	This is clearly not abuse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_202.wav	2.05	He should be careful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_203.wav	3.16	Everyone knew the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_204.wav	2.60	I am prepared to step down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_205.wav	3.33	Translation - we got it wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_206.wav	2.60	We will be working on that this week, all right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_207.wav	2.48	These are serious matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_208.wav	2.18	The pace is telling.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_209.wav	3.08	She has always been very friendly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_210.wav	2.48	Their loss is heartbreaking.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_211.wav	3.67	It is his script.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_212.wav	2.18	I am a socialist.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_213.wav	3.12	The response was really good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_214.wav	2.39	The squad is too small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_215.wav	2.61	You can blame the defence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_216.wav	2.82	Usually the enjoyment is two ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_217.wav	2.39	It just could be a good night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_218.wav	1.75	But we were wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_219.wav	2.56	This has gone on too long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_220.wav	2.31	It is an outrage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_221.wav	2.18	It is a performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_222.wav	1.58	It is the best place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_223.wav	2.09	We tried to get them down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_224.wav	7.13	There were other problems for Brown yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_225.wav	3.03	I don't know the full story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_226.wav	5.55	Part-time staff are being laid off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_227.wav	4.31	Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_228.wav	3.59	But they have taken the lesson to heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_229.wav	3.07	I just want him to win a tournament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_230.wav	3.35	Eight others are also believed to have died.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_231.wav	4.27	This time, he will be more on the defensive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_232.wav	3.63	I will never see my son again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_233.wav	3.37	But it is being pursued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_234.wav	3.16	He knew they were there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_235.wav	2.61	That would end it for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_236.wav	3.50	We didn't and it cost us the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_237.wav	2.60	It attracted no complaints.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_238.wav	3.29	Neil is never going to come back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_239.wav	3.63	The years of campaigning have been very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_240.wav	2.99	Four of the victims were women.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_241.wav	3.46	He was also very happy to listen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_242.wav	2.52	It's to do with this place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_243.wav	3.03	It's a technical demand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_244.wav	2.48	Sadly it is a mess.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_245.wav	3.76	That has to take its toll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_246.wav	2.95	We want to see the maximum of change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_247.wav	2.65	But those days are dead and gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_248.wav	4.31	However we must not be complacent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_249.wav	2.39	And that was just the start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_250.wav	3.37	Nothing was meant by it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_251.wav	3.93	That was my last game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_252.wav	2.65	Colour is another problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_253.wav	4.06	It is not just the agencies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_254.wav	2.75	It came in bits and pieces.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_255.wav	1.75	You don't see that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_256.wav	3.24	They seem to be, anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_257.wav	2.95	I thought they were just excited.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_258.wav	3.37	He will appear in court today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_259.wav	1.62	Or is he?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_260.wav	2.69	Was he confident about his prospects?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_261.wav	3.07	What can you do?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_262.wav	3.03	It's been very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_263.wav	3.46	Do something that we need.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_264.wav	4.01	There is no other offer on the table.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_265.wav	3.72	When she returned, it was a wreck.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_266.wav	3.67	Nobody is pushing out to the right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_267.wav	4.23	It is difficult to say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_268.wav	2.86	He is not the only one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_269.wav	2.99	We call it marriage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_270.wav	3.72	Full back was a bit of the unknown.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_271.wav	2.39	It's not the tour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_272.wav	2.60	So what is the secret of the success?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_273.wav	2.77	My husband was fighting for his life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_274.wav	2.39	So was the first half.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_275.wav	2.90	It is still under discussion with the board.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_276.wav	2.14	That is one point of view.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_277.wav	2.43	We are in this for the long haul.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_278.wav	1.79	Here we go then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_279.wav	1.80	No reason was given.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_280.wav	2.26	I can't wait for it to come out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_281.wav	2.73	I am really sorry that he is going.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_282.wav	3.42	Indeed, that has already begun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_283.wav	2.18	But it's the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_284.wav	3.24	We have been here before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_285.wav	3.76	And he did that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_286.wav	2.48	And she is very clear on this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_287.wav	2.43	His remarks were disgraceful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_288.wav	2.69	I did not think it was very proper.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_289.wav	3.12	I have really noticed that this week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_290.wav	2.48	In a way he was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_291.wav	2.35	I will never forget that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_292.wav	2.52	It was considered to be topical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_293.wav	2.27	Well, that's all right then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_294.wav	2.43	No-one is a winner in this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_295.wav	2.35	Who wants to be a millionaire?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_296.wav	1.84	What do you think?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_297.wav	2.73	They went back to the seventeenth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_298.wav	3.07	If we don't do it, someone else will.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_299.wav	2.65	Again, there was no detail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_300.wav	2.30	Let the voters decide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_301.wav	1.80	Then it will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_302.wav	1.84	It should be easy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_303.wav	1.54	Is it worth it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_304.wav	2.73	I will build a house on the site.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_305.wav	2.77	We are right at the heart of Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_306.wav	1.84	I do my job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_307.wav	2.27	They have to get that sorted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_308.wav	2.78	That is a dangerous assumption.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_309.wav	1.96	Does it make a profit?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_310.wav	1.92	I think it's a good sign.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_311.wav	2.69	A winter of discontent awaits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_312.wav	1.92	I knew him well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_313.wav	2.30	I am not ready to walk away.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_314.wav	3.37	Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_315.wav	3.50	They are already there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_316.wav	2.77	I'd never given up on myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_317.wav	2.61	The concerns were unfounded.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_318.wav	2.31	It doesn't look good for her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_319.wav	2.90	It was a management problem in the hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_320.wav	1.96	I have some comments.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_321.wav	2.05	You have to be realistic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_322.wav	2.44	There was nowhere for him to go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_323.wav	2.18	Not that he was complaining.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_324.wav	2.18	We are very proud of him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_325.wav	3.20	There they were, making excuses for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_326.wav	2.18	It just got out of control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_327.wav	3.20	Every case is completely different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_328.wav	2.61	It's all about unfinished business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_329.wav	2.99	Our own people are coming over on Friday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_330.wav	2.65	In Scotland, there should be vigilance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_331.wav	1.97	It will be fine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_332.wav	2.48	Yet the job is far from over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_333.wav	1.88	He has a point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_334.wav	2.22	He should emerge as the winner.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_335.wav	1.84	It is our other home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_336.wav	3.25	When you think you cannot go on, you can.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_337.wav	2.69	What a difference a game can make.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_338.wav	2.09	It is their day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_339.wav	4.36	They are a very good side, without a doubt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_340.wav	3.16	They are used to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_341.wav	3.12	And we are doing it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_342.wav	2.31	It's just not good enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_343.wav	2.01	I have a cold.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_344.wav	2.43	You've got to hand it to them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_345.wav	3.76	Next League matches, Aberdeen - Dundee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_346.wav	2.43	It was his own decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_347.wav	2.91	This is still happening in the US.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_348.wav	2.39	And that was the real problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_349.wav	2.56	But then the problems began.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_350.wav	2.73	It wasn't about her singing, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_351.wav	3.42	From the opening Could It Be Magic?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_352.wav	2.69	The duties are still to be drawn up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_353.wav	3.20	That there would be discussions.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_354.wav	2.09	It must not happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_355.wav	2.18	That would be unsafe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_356.wav	3.16	I did not go looking anywhere else.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_357.wav	2.86	We had no idea what was going on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_358.wav	2.44	If only it had been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_359.wav	2.39	So far, it is no more.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_360.wav	2.60	Seven people were critically injured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_361.wav	2.39	I am very sorry to be here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_362.wav	2.39	He could have given them a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_363.wav	2.01	It was up to him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_364.wav	2.35	It's going to happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_365.wav	1.75	I don't think so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_366.wav	2.35	And that was just about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_367.wav	2.35	By hard work, is the answer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_368.wav	2.94	It is really special to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_369.wav	2.48	This is a major step forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_370.wav	2.31	They haven't got the uniform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_371.wav	2.22	Well, you don't have time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_372.wav	1.88	It is very funny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_373.wav	3.29	I just hope it's not tonight against us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_374.wav	3.12	This is good news for the industry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_375.wav	2.01	There are no quick fixes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_376.wav	2.95	Because they didn't want to know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_377.wav	2.39	What do we have to do?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_378.wav	2.99	I have never seen anything like it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_379.wav	2.18	It's about New Yorkers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_380.wav	2.74	That was a real challenge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_381.wav	2.91	They will give it a couple of years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_382.wav	2.35	He certainly would have approved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_383.wav	2.09	Conditions were less than ideal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_384.wav	2.31	We want this place to work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_385.wav	2.35	Father is on the train.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_386.wav	2.35	It could have been prevented.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_387.wav	2.52	We have been going for three years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_388.wav	3.08	Firstly, we don't know we can do this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_389.wav	2.73	I think it was entirely the right decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_390.wav	2.65	It is planned for London in the spring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_391.wav	2.35	Everything is coming together well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_392.wav	2.69	They would have to go to the Royal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_393.wav	2.38	But we are not afraid of them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_394.wav	2.12	It didn't matter who was in their way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_395.wav	3.37	That will be the criteria for the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_396.wav	2.48	They thought they couldn't get any.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_397.wav	3.37	He was too good for me - too consistent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_398.wav	2.95	I am delighted to have her back home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_399.wav	3.20	This idea is a good starting point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_400.wav	2.91	She had denied the charge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_401.wav	2.44	It was cynical and callous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_402.wav	2.09	It's a dead end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_403.wav	3.59	What sort of man is that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_404.wav	1.84	The message was clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_405.wav	2.22	We are going nowhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_406.wav	3.12	It is truly masterly performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_407.wav	2.65	She failed to win any of them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_408.wav	2.74	It is believed he had been stabbed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_409.wav	3.12	Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_410.wav	3.80	It has a rally instead of a conference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_411.wav	3.33	I found that we couldn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_412.wav	3.03	He is very sensitive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_413.wav	3.33	That can benefit the larger companies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_414.wav	3.37	I am still waiting for a reply.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_415.wav	2.31	We told them in July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_416.wav	3.25	This was a very tragic accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_417.wav	2.44	We are very, very confident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_418.wav	2.90	It is a result we should savour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_419.wav	2.65	Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_420.wav	2.61	We certainly do not intend to disband.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_421.wav	2.10	My life is going to go on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_422.wav	2.14	It's really part of our mission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_423.wav	2.05	That was only the start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p361\p361_424.wav	2.56	But what took them so long?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_001.wav	2.35	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_002.wav	4.70	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_003.wav	7.81	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_004.wav	5.21	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_005.wav	6.31	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_006.wav	5.72	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_007.wav	5.04	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_008.wav	8.45	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_009.wav	5.47	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_010.wav	3.63	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_011.wav	7.51	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_012.wav	5.29	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_013.wav	5.25	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_014.wav	5.25	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_015.wav	6.75	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_016.wav	8.28	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_017.wav	4.61	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_018.wav	6.02	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_019.wav	9.22	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_020.wav	4.57	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_021.wav	10.63	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_022.wav	9.18	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_023.wav	13.31	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_024.wav	7.60	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_025.wav	4.14	We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_026.wav	2.35	This is your country.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_027.wav	3.54	Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_028.wav	2.60	I feel really good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_029.wav	2.39	It was a fairy tale.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_030.wav	2.86	But there are no plans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_031.wav	3.50	They responded in the most positive way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_032.wav	3.59	I have a very strong opinion about this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_033.wav	3.50	The British government said she was coming home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_034.wav	2.73	We are a peaceful people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_035.wav	2.18	His mother was English.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_036.wav	2.52	He was jailed for five years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_037.wav	2.86	It's not Big Brother at sea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_038.wav	2.73	Was this a new event?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_039.wav	3.88	To beat the European champion is quite nice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_040.wav	2.14	They had a confession.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_041.wav	4.70	As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_042.wav	2.52	The chances were plentiful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_043.wav	3.09	They were impressive against France.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_044.wav	4.10	This is only one example.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_045.wav	4.31	His style is suited to Scottish football.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_046.wav	2.39	The cause is just.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_047.wav	2.52	I am so upset.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_048.wav	4.14	England could not take anything for granted, however.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_049.wav	2.52	They finished second and third.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_050.wav	3.24	But this was refused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_051.wav	4.78	Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_052.wav	3.24	Hasn't let anyone down?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_053.wav	5.08	We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_054.wav	3.19	We certainly hope we have been successful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_055.wav	3.07	He is one of them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_056.wav	2.82	This was no accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_057.wav	2.99	He is a law unto himself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_058.wav	2.56	It is a sign of hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_059.wav	3.03	With him are the symbols of his faith.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_060.wav	3.24	They're interested only in profits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_061.wav	2.29	And there has been a good start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_062.wav	2.86	I feel my parents are in New York.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_063.wav	3.80	Policing the profession is important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_064.wav	3.16	Seems a sensible compromise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_065.wav	2.18	She had no chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_066.wav	3.29	In the meantime, you just have to get on with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_067.wav	2.44	I don't have a problem with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_068.wav	3.12	How is he enjoying life as a senior?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_069.wav	2.60	It's more relaxing this way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_070.wav	2.82	Allison is not convinced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_071.wav	3.24	We have to move forward from now on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_072.wav	2.39	And it was this one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_073.wav	2.56	I am going to win the next two.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_074.wav	2.18	She's afraid of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_075.wav	2.78	But there is good and bad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_076.wav	3.58	The real problem is the Usher Hall.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_077.wav	2.60	That is her job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_078.wav	2.82	They have broken that promise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_079.wav	2.56	I don't know what it means.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_080.wav	4.18	I found the course inspiring.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_081.wav	2.22	I have to accept that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_082.wav	3.21	It means the margin for error is tight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_083.wav	2.73	I thought he was part of the camera.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_084.wav	2.32	She is now on the back benches.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_085.wav	3.33	It is not a road of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_086.wav	2.82	Three bystanders were killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_087.wav	4.19	One is investment, one is reform.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_088.wav	2.65	They could not have done more for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_089.wav	4.31	There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_090.wav	2.44	It benefits the whole family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_091.wav	2.31	It's not my fault.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_092.wav	2.56	My husband was angry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_093.wav	4.53	Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_094.wav	3.46	Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_095.wav	3.20	Sure, this is a very important event for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_096.wav	3.33	They have to work so hard.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_097.wav	2.95	Well, was it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_098.wav	3.97	I thought he was my friend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_099.wav	2.57	What kind of person is he?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_100.wav	2.52	There's a strong involvement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_101.wav	2.78	This is complete nonsense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_102.wav	2.69	This Government is cutting taxes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_103.wav	3.97	The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_104.wav	2.60	They know their son was murdered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_105.wav	3.46	Most of them were one-year conscripts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_106.wav	2.52	So is that it, then?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_107.wav	2.35	The task is enormous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_108.wav	2.01	I know he meant it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_109.wav	3.58	A, The media has been great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_110.wav	2.61	There have been so many.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_111.wav	3.63	Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_112.wav	2.60	Of course, it is nonsense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_113.wav	3.42	I've never felt affection for Emu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_114.wav	2.99	He had returned to die.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_115.wav	2.39	Anyone can take a photo.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_116.wav	2.48	He is involved in everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_117.wav	2.22	No person was charged.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_118.wav	2.39	You see, my back has gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_119.wav	1.88	He's a nice guy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_120.wav	2.52	The fire was still coming down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_121.wav	1.92	It's always the way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_122.wav	2.52	I got the surprise of my life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_123.wav	2.01	It will be tight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_124.wav	2.65	He seems to be used to the attention.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_125.wav	2.43	Both are national treasures.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_126.wav	3.25	I accept that, but it is very upsetting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_127.wav	2.18	Well, you don't have time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_128.wav	3.76	I had never done anything like it before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_129.wav	2.73	I feel it's time to make the switch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_130.wav	3.12	But he thought the overall results were good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_131.wav	3.20	Stewart will travel with some confidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_132.wav	2.82	I had been hoping for justice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_133.wav	2.90	Labour is providing none of these.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_134.wav	2.56	The building was starting to come down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_135.wav	3.37	No other vehicle was involved in the crash.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_136.wav	3.59	There is enormous interest in Scotland the Brand.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_137.wav	2.31	There is a subtle difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_138.wav	2.39	He has created the confusion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_139.wav	2.01	He didn't get out much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_140.wav	2.18	She was very different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_141.wav	2.18	That is my dream.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_142.wav	3.29	Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_143.wav	4.49	The problem is not confined to Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_144.wav	4.10	Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_145.wav	2.01	The choice is simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_146.wav	2.86	Who is going to pay their wages?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_147.wav	2.95	I don't think we deserved to lose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_148.wav	2.78	It was that kind of match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_149.wav	2.43	We couldn't believe it at first.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_150.wav	3.20	Feel the air, the space.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_151.wav	2.39	I have nothing to regret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_152.wav	4.44	Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_153.wav	3.42	A century on, little has changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_154.wav	3.06	Wrong decisions Address in full
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_155.wav	2.82	I asked to take it up to Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_156.wav	3.42	He is having a nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_157.wav	2.82	And he still is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_158.wav	3.46	However, the story has a happy ending.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_159.wav	2.52	You never had it so good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_160.wav	3.63	Even for a British Open, this is different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_161.wav	2.09	Then he did it twice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_162.wav	3.29	So is the rest of British sport.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_163.wav	3.07	Genetic assessment is crucial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_164.wav	2.95	It was his greatest movie performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_165.wav	2.56	We go back a long way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_166.wav	2.31	So, easy does it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_167.wav	2.86	Not that he's declined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_168.wav	3.33	People also have trouble with the currency.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_169.wav	2.65	I always wanted her to be happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_170.wav	2.69	We've got to get back to normal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_171.wav	2.52	Do we want to see it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_172.wav	4.10	That is for certain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_173.wav	3.16	An inquiry has begun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_174.wav	2.39	I was a little surprised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_175.wav	2.82	That is not, however, the case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_176.wav	2.95	Only two players have done it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_177.wav	3.07	He is a master of deceit and delay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_178.wav	3.46	He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_179.wav	3.16	What was that all about?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_180.wav	2.69	This is a fine appointment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_181.wav	3.88	That was the finest moment in my career.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_182.wav	2.71	England will be quite prepared.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_183.wav	3.25	He is appealing to women.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_184.wav	3.03	There is no conflict of interest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_185.wav	3.46	She has the biggest part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_186.wav	3.03	Film music was never the same again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_187.wav	3.42	It was a deeply moving musical experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_188.wav	2.48	I thought he was at fault.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_189.wav	2.52	The First Minister is an addict.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_190.wav	2.90	We will win this tie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_191.wav	2.52	I think he's done it a few times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_192.wav	2.48	Something happened on that island.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_193.wav	2.01	This is a business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_194.wav	4.48	Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_195.wav	4.23	I never had any real direction at school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_196.wav	2.35	That's how it works.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_197.wav	3.93	It is quite a young team, so the future is there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_198.wav	2.56	Do what you want to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_199.wav	3.29	We know the quality of life goes up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_200.wav	2.65	Who are the public?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_201.wav	4.10	When it is ready, it will be signed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_203.wav	4.87	But we have learned that it doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_204.wav	3.67	I'm looking forward to coming home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_205.wav	2.69	They should not be blamed for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_206.wav	3.76	He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_207.wav	3.63	Glasgow is a very welcoming place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_208.wav	2.65	It was crucial strike.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_209.wav	2.05	I have no secrets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_210.wav	2.39	What do you want to say?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_211.wav	2.05	I was so relieved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_212.wav	2.56	They continue to do so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_213.wav	3.58	I think that's a bit of an invasion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_214.wav	2.69	It is a worry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_215.wav	3.50	We are not a retailer, we provide a service.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_216.wav	2.65	That is highly unfair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_217.wav	3.59	They are not the answer to staff shortages.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_218.wav	2.52	Gas is too expensive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_219.wav	3.67	This plan is an agenda for action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_220.wav	2.56	It was all relative.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_221.wav	3.37	And, within itself, it is visionary.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_222.wav	2.65	Are you up for business?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_223.wav	3.67	It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_224.wav	2.69	You are not in any kind of trouble.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_225.wav	3.12	It also makes for interesting viewing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_226.wav	2.48	Life becomes a song.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_227.wav	2.61	No wonder he missed the conversion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_228.wav	2.31	Sadly, they did not.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_229.wav	2.05	We have nowhere to go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_230.wav	2.56	He has every right to do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_231.wav	4.95	Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_232.wav	2.61	That had never happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_233.wav	3.29	However, our players will fight for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_234.wav	2.05	They are not suitable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_235.wav	3.16	He is advised that he has done so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_236.wav	2.52	You mean he didn't get the girl?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_237.wav	3.84	He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_238.wav	3.46	The Prime Minister has been in touch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_239.wav	2.77	But the killing will continue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_240.wav	2.35	They've got to get better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_241.wav	3.07	But we are working together for this result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_242.wav	2.69	Mental health is a massive issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_243.wav	2.14	It doesn't make them evil.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_244.wav	3.03	We don't want to be too intrusive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_245.wav	2.82	The most important thing is the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_246.wav	2.48	He said nothing of the sort.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_247.wav	3.21	This would give Scotland around eight members.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_248.wav	3.46	In saying that, you just have to get on with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_249.wav	1.75	The door is open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_250.wav	3.08	Pulled a huge number of viewers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_251.wav	3.93	Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_252.wav	3.54	Lara is very, very much a girl.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_253.wav	2.26	So what went wrong?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_254.wav	2.48	We did not play well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_255.wav	2.61	We are in a very strong position.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_256.wav	3.08	This will have no effect on the championship.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_257.wav	2.43	That is the key.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_258.wav	2.18	So, how did you do?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_259.wav	2.91	Well, until recently he didn't think so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_260.wav	2.86	It was, however, the wrong side.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_261.wav	2.35	I can't deny that fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_262.wav	2.30	She is now planning a visit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_263.wav	3.25	We could have done without this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_264.wav	3.42	Boy is the town a mess.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_265.wav	3.33	Substantial pockets of resistance remain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_266.wav	2.73	He's a great dealer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_267.wav	4.06	Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_268.wav	4.44	I want to concentrate on the real issues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_269.wav	3.59	He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_270.wav	2.43	We are moving on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_271.wav	2.01	This is not a crisis.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_272.wav	2.05	There's always a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_273.wav	3.37	I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_274.wav	3.12	For me, it's a tension you can feel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_275.wav	3.93	For some, it might not make too much difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_276.wav	3.03	That's a very serious matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_277.wav	3.08	They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_278.wav	2.82	But it was to no avail.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_279.wav	3.48	Sad to say, it's still waiting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_280.wav	2.95	It has been a major success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_281.wav	2.57	It takes a bit of working out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_282.wav	5.42	I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_283.wav	2.56	But it didn't bother me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_284.wav	3.29	I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_285.wav	3.03	I'm very relaxed about that indeed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_286.wav	3.12	He will not be coming back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_287.wav	3.55	He is also a great finisher.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_288.wav	2.35	I don't see any problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_289.wav	3.33	It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_290.wav	3.59	Yet it seemed to work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_291.wav	2.65	Let us hope it doesn't come to that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_292.wav	2.52	I have never felt so well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_293.wav	2.78	There are other things going on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_294.wav	2.27	All is now forgiven.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_295.wav	2.01	So who is right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_296.wav	2.82	And this tournament will travel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_297.wav	2.86	There will be new memories.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_298.wav	4.01	Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_299.wav	2.39	We know the goals will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_300.wav	2.31	How can they get one?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_301.wav	2.22	It was an insult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_302.wav	3.20	But we all have to look at ourselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_303.wav	2.56	We have nothing to hide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_304.wav	2.44	He added, We are full of anger.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_305.wav	2.48	He did it all for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_306.wav	2.39	I don't think that is good enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_307.wav	2.39	Of course it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_308.wav	2.13	We all make mistakes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_309.wav	3.33	It was published yesterday on the internet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_310.wav	2.22	That is my commitment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_311.wav	2.77	This is the only problem with the story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_312.wav	2.69	It is good football in Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_313.wav	2.86	Knowledge is everything at this level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_314.wav	1.84	Is that right?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_315.wav	3.29	So other options had to be explored.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_316.wav	2.82	They should be so lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_317.wav	3.16	He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_318.wav	2.18	It is good news for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_319.wav	2.22	The timing is obvious.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_320.wav	3.63	He's a good player, but he's not the only one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_321.wav	3.12	Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_322.wav	3.16	I don't think it's very real.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_323.wav	3.89	Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_324.wav	2.14	I think she was right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_325.wav	2.31	Is that what people want?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_326.wav	3.29	CHRISTMAS is special, a time for reflection.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_327.wav	2.65	I'd like to continue that record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_328.wav	2.65	It will be a new experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_329.wav	2.99	The process itself has taken over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_330.wav	2.78	She asked for the appointment with me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_331.wav	2.65	The time commitment is the biggest thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_332.wav	2.56	It is quite hard to track.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_333.wav	2.44	It's not going to last five minutes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_334.wav	2.90	But his attendance is not guaranteed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_335.wav	3.84	Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_336.wav	3.93	I am sure all schools would accept that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_337.wav	2.73	It was quite an ordeal for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_338.wav	2.95	There are a number of possible outcomes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_339.wav	2.14	Doesn't matter what you do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_340.wav	2.73	O no it's not!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_341.wav	4.16	The result could be all down to turnout.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_342.wav	2.65	They are in good spirits.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_343.wav	3.37	Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_344.wav	2.69	He was their leader.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_345.wav	2.78	The support of Britain is assumed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_346.wav	2.78	So far he has not done so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_347.wav	2.56	Maybe they will show it next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_348.wav	2.35	They are a very good team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_349.wav	2.35	So there we are.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_350.wav	3.03	And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_351.wav	3.37	It doesn't make me feel any better.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_352.wav	2.82	The conversion didn't go over either.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_353.wav	2.31	The incident is dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_354.wav	2.65	We are delighted with the result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_355.wav	2.01	It will take time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_356.wav	2.56	They will do something big.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_357.wav	2.35	The programme was awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_358.wav	2.35	It is having a big impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_359.wav	2.86	That is very hard, alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_360.wav	2.69	I am feeling on top of the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_361.wav	2.22	Doesn't he miss it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_362.wav	2.35	The same goes for Russia.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_363.wav	2.22	They went down together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_364.wav	2.78	Cooking is intricate and complex.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_365.wav	5.17	One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_366.wav	2.73	We were getting very worried.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_367.wav	5.46	Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_368.wav	2.10	You can't really compare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_369.wav	2.78	We thought we were looking in good shape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_370.wav	3.24	Plot is not the issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_371.wav	2.99	We need to increase the membership.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_372.wav	2.82	Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_373.wav	2.35	We should not be complacent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_374.wav	2.56	We all want the same things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_375.wav	2.09	Maybe his time has gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_376.wav	2.95	She died in hospital two hours later.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_377.wav	2.95	Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_378.wav	3.41	SO, that is it for another year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_379.wav	2.26	The results are tragic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_380.wav	3.59	We are not getting him back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_381.wav	2.26	He was on a horse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_382.wav	3.46	Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_383.wav	3.84	I told her, and she was extremely grateful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_384.wav	2.73	There may be reasons for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_385.wav	2.60	He had taken everything from me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_386.wav	3.03	It's a good offer by any standards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_387.wav	2.26	Yes, it took time to recover.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_388.wav	3.07	The potential is always in the idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_389.wav	2.39	I am not a frustrated actor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_390.wav	3.21	No progress has been made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_391.wav	3.12	He can win every week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_392.wav	2.01	This makes up for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_393.wav	1.88	My mind was made up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_394.wav	3.63	The plot is changing as time goes on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_395.wav	2.95	I never got anything out of it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_396.wav	2.52	It is patently true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_397.wav	4.06	Locate in Scotland also refused to comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_398.wav	3.08	But don't just take my word, for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_399.wav	4.18	That is why he is so special.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_400.wav	2.52	You hope he prevails.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_401.wav	2.82	My mother was getting on at me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_402.wav	2.95	This is a very serious matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_403.wav	2.13	It's going to be great!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_404.wav	2.09	That's a good sign.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_405.wav	2.86	I'd never heard anything like it before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_406.wav	6.27	He added that he felt undermined.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_407.wav	2.18	Hopefully, it will be good enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_408.wav	2.35	He declined to be more specific.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_409.wav	3.29	But it looks good for next year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_410.wav	3.20	Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_411.wav	3.29	We want everyone to have a good time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_412.wav	2.39	We're going to rebuild.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_413.wav	2.61	We are trying to do it properly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_414.wav	2.95	We actually had a laugh about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_415.wav	2.31	It raises the edge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_416.wav	3.29	He is wanted by German police for questioning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_417.wav	2.01	I had no idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_418.wav	2.52	As indeed it did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_419.wav	2.86	We made a world record together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_420.wav	2.99	They were outside the circle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_421.wav	3.12	I want to help other women.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_422.wav	1.79	He got the part.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_423.wav	2.14	Or, rather, it isn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p362\p362_424.wav	2.82	He refused to name the survivors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_001.wav	2.26	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_002.wav	3.71	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_003.wav	6.96	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_004.wav	4.87	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_005.wav	6.96	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_006.wav	5.42	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_007.wav	4.74	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_008.wav	7.86	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_009.wav	4.01	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_010.wav	3.16	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_011.wav	6.43	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_012.wav	4.61	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_013.wav	4.74	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_014.wav	4.57	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_015.wav	5.64	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_016.wav	6.27	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_017.wav	4.27	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_018.wav	5.42	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_019.wav	6.83	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_020.wav	4.05	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_021.wav	8.07	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_022.wav	6.40	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_023.wav	10.07	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_024.wav	6.40	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_025.wav	2.91	It's never been to committee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_026.wav	3.20	Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_027.wav	2.91	It was actually very, very difficult.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_028.wav	2.74	The proposals were not new.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_029.wav	3.37	He scored one goal and was on fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_030.wav	3.11	His party never arrived.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_031.wav	3.97	Visitors are directed instantly to the shop.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_032.wav	3.46	If that is the case, it is a breakthrough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_033.wav	3.12	He gave no other details.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_034.wav	2.99	It's not an improvement for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_035.wav	3.07	I think it is wide open.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_036.wav	2.90	It certainly is cause for concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_037.wav	2.99	It's on with a roller.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_038.wav	2.90	The captaincy will help that, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_039.wav	3.38	That's probably the hard bit about being dropped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_040.wav	2.86	I think we're a long way forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_041.wav	2.78	The impact was immediate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_042.wav	3.42	There is a new confidence about the club.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_043.wav	2.30	His film is not.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_044.wav	2.52	It is the strength of the school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_045.wav	2.99	In my experience, he does not do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_046.wav	2.18	That is good news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_047.wav	2.90	This has come as a shock to everyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_048.wav	2.44	He will never be forgotten.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_049.wav	2.95	I was not overly concerned about this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_050.wav	3.37	He was very grateful for his health.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_051.wav	2.39	The nation has his music.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_052.wav	3.42	But real life is not like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_053.wav	2.01	So now we know.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_054.wav	2.86	That is why this action has been taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_055.wav	2.22	Who will pay for this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_056.wav	2.91	The defender should have won the bloody ba.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_057.wav	3.20	There has been a reduction in cleaning standards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_058.wav	2.43	We were upset about the referee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_059.wav	2.22	That is our objective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_060.wav	1.92	What's the problem?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_061.wav	2.10	He is not alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_062.wav	2.18	He did that last Sunday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_063.wav	2.31	There wasn't anything in it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_064.wav	2.65	The club is afflicted by injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_065.wav	3.71	Sentencing is also being considered in that review.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_066.wav	1.97	Lovely day isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_067.wav	2.78	It was far from business as usual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_068.wav	3.46	Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_069.wav	2.43	The show is not over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_070.wav	2.56	Saddam Hussein is a devil.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_071.wav	2.56	This is a judgment issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_072.wav	3.29	Thirty people have applied for his job!
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_073.wav	2.86	It was just an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_074.wav	2.73	We are not commenting at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_075.wav	3.08	Today we must not repeat that mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_076.wav	3.29	Somebody should have noticed that something was wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_077.wav	2.44	He is slightly confused.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_078.wav	3.67	We did not deserve to go through.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_079.wav	2.61	The course has helped a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_080.wav	3.76	All the time, that number was coming down and down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_081.wav	2.22	There is room for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_082.wav	2.56	That can only be a good thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_083.wav	2.78	I have never seen anything like this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_084.wav	2.43	They are difficult awards to decide.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_085.wav	2.48	It was that kind of war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_086.wav	2.30	That is my preference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_087.wav	2.99	He later told The Herald, It is true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_088.wav	2.78	It has come a long way since then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_089.wav	2.82	It was decided he should be dismissed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_090.wav	2.35	But someone has got to do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_091.wav	2.43	We have not given up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_092.wav	3.03	It was the turning point of the afternoon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_093.wav	2.82	I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_094.wav	2.22	What has happened?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_095.wav	3.72	If they are not, the commission will take action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_096.wav	2.35	Where will the money come from?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_097.wav	2.56	She is still very poorly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_098.wav	1.97	It was good fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_099.wav	2.13	This is a great shame.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_100.wav	3.37	We talk about effective military action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_101.wav	1.79	I can't get it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_102.wav	2.78	It was entirely justified.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_103.wav	2.52	He demanded to speak to the boss.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_104.wav	2.39	It's somewhere in between.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_105.wav	2.52	The play was to go straight ahead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_106.wav	2.60	He had never run the distance before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_107.wav	2.18	I am the head.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_108.wav	2.61	He is obviously very dangerous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_109.wav	2.56	It can be very worrying.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_110.wav	2.26	It's harder, believe me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_111.wav	2.60	We are making no comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_112.wav	2.22	I sit at home a lot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_113.wav	2.78	That was certainly the case for the parties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_114.wav	2.73	I hope the couples are still together.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_115.wav	3.59	We have learned a tremendous amount.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_116.wav	3.03	But that is not enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_117.wav	3.16	These people are helpless.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_118.wav	1.96	I wish him well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_119.wav	3.29	Only the details have to be sorted out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_120.wav	3.29	It would be really interesting if they did.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_121.wav	2.60	That takes a lot of courage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_122.wav	2.57	Sadly, it is not to be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_123.wav	2.48	Motorists will welcome this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_124.wav	2.27	I welcome this Bill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_125.wav	2.35	This is not a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_126.wav	2.48	he announced his plans.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_127.wav	2.65	He is the man to beat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_128.wav	2.35	We are getting not a penny.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_129.wav	2.52	Look at the turn-out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_130.wav	2.65	Which brings us to the question of money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_131.wav	1.92	It is very simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_132.wav	2.74	There was something special about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_133.wav	2.52	Many other areas are coming up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_134.wav	2.82	Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_135.wav	2.56	There were no reports of casualties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_136.wav	2.31	But it's a subtle process.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_137.wav	2.65	She didn't tell me anything the night before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_138.wav	2.99	I will be having talks with the workforce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_139.wav	2.43	Changes need to be made.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_140.wav	2.14	Things are going well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_141.wav	2.22	Hard it will be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_142.wav	1.97	I was deeply worried.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_143.wav	2.30	Maybe it will work there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_144.wav	1.88	How does it all work?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_145.wav	2.52	We could easily have lost that game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_146.wav	2.18	There's a lot of it going on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_147.wav	2.18	I doubt it would be genuine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_148.wav	2.39	It would be a masterclass.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_149.wav	2.82	It would have been a very explosive issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_150.wav	3.12	I didn't really expect to be called up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_151.wav	2.56	They will not be going back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_152.wav	2.35	The progress has been steady.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_153.wav	2.14	It has no chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_154.wav	2.52	His body was never found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_155.wav	3.25	If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_156.wav	2.48	We have been extremely busy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_157.wav	2.30	It appears to have been successful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_158.wav	2.22	This is a big game for them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_159.wav	2.27	We still have to wait for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_160.wav	2.65	He said it was his greatest work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_161.wav	2.31	I feel a little betrayed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_162.wav	2.39	The baby deserves the credit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_163.wav	2.09	I live for today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_164.wav	2.39	I have been very stupid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_165.wav	3.12	I always savour the company of The Voice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_166.wav	2.35	My father and mother are.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_167.wav	2.18	But that was his nature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_168.wav	2.65	We have been together for five years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_169.wav	2.26	They would never let him go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_170.wav	2.05	So what's in store?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_171.wav	2.35	He didn't know where to look.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_172.wav	2.31	The German had a point to make.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_173.wav	2.18	There are two characters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_174.wav	2.39	The only trouble is finding them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_175.wav	2.61	Scotland won by six wickets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_176.wav	2.77	Her body has never been found.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_177.wav	2.86	It is all credit to them today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_178.wav	2.48	That was a huge experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_179.wav	2.22	Perhaps it was just as well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_180.wav	2.39	Will he be here for the weekend?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_181.wav	2.22	He can do everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_182.wav	2.48	Now is the time for action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_183.wav	2.95	Public safety is paramount.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_184.wav	2.95	I feel really confident in that department.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_185.wav	2.48	They were not consulted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_186.wav	2.69	He had an apartment ready.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_187.wav	2.78	The prime minister will make the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_188.wav	2.82	THERE's only one word for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_189.wav	2.82	We're trying to get rounded performers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_190.wav	2.65	It was far more important than that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_191.wav	2.43	That is European law.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_192.wav	2.57	Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_193.wav	3.07	Their appeal will be heard this week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_194.wav	3.50	Their own instinctive response was confirmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_195.wav	1.97	Why is he not fighting for the Union?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_196.wav	2.73	A decision is expected tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_197.wav	2.65	I wanted to get on with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_198.wav	2.22	I don't think it's the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_199.wav	2.27	Well, you might have a point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_200.wav	2.35	It was a horrible moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_201.wav	2.48	It was quite distressing for the crew.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_202.wav	3.46	Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_203.wav	2.39	I really had to concentrate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_204.wav	2.86	We didn't want any trouble.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_205.wav	2.65	Frankly, they have to crack down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_206.wav	2.99	The training will take place in Downing Street.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_207.wav	2.86	We have still got the fight in us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_208.wav	2.82	That decision is now being appealed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_209.wav	2.52	This is really good news for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_210.wav	2.09	I wanted to have a go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_211.wav	3.07	A senior party insider said.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_212.wav	2.39	We got on very well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_213.wav	2.39	I think it must be the uniforms.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_214.wav	2.90	This is not a monument to the past.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_215.wav	2.52	We can all understand that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_216.wav	2.74	You are going to have to do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_217.wav	2.39	I was amazed at her knowledge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_218.wav	2.26	Where is the evidence?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_219.wav	2.73	It was important in training terms.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_220.wav	2.60	Ours is on for two days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_221.wav	2.31	We don't want that at all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_222.wav	2.69	Her appeal is to be heard this week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_223.wav	2.86	The group will report back in the summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_224.wav	2.73	Among them is his beloved teacher.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_225.wav	2.78	We don't come here for our health.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_226.wav	2.44	That in itself is a joke.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_227.wav	2.43	They know nothing about the sport.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_228.wav	2.35	But we shall have to talk to him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_229.wav	2.57	Well, we know now.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_230.wav	2.69	He was only doing his job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_231.wav	2.52	They chose the latter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_232.wav	2.90	The legal process could last weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_233.wav	2.95	All were later allowed home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_234.wav	2.39	I can do this on my own.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_235.wav	2.35	Will you just put it away?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_236.wav	2.99	I think it's more important to have fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_237.wav	2.44	By then it was too late.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_238.wav	2.57	I am very sorry to hear about this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_239.wav	2.46	I'm so looking forward to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_240.wav	1.34	I think we can do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_241.wav	2.69	That ignorance is crucial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_242.wav	2.56	It was an excellent performance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_243.wav	2.73	It is also claimed that he was murdered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_244.wav	2.48	Clearly, there was a mix-up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_245.wav	2.48	I have not had much of him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_246.wav	3.07	Sub Not Used, MacKay.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_247.wav	3.08	We are taking no chances this time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_248.wav	2.48	He is to be commended.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_249.wav	2.39	I can hardly believe it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_250.wav	2.22	The goals will come.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_251.wav	2.14	I don't feel like working.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_252.wav	2.52	Then one day it happened.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_253.wav	2.52	I sit in the car.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_254.wav	2.39	We stopped at half-time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_255.wav	3.16	I was brought up in a mining background.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_256.wav	2.78	All winners should be tested.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_257.wav	2.39	We would like to see them in court.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_258.wav	2.86	I thought his speech was a disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_259.wav	2.30	It is not a soap opera.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_260.wav	3.25	Whatever we do, we know we can do well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_261.wav	2.73	They may not always be so lucky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_262.wav	2.65	Where was the point in all this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_263.wav	2.35	He was travelling to see his daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_264.wav	2.91	It's an hour of the same response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_265.wav	2.82	This is the root of their problems.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_266.wav	2.82	Two other men have recovered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_267.wav	2.43	It will be a challenging film.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_268.wav	2.82	The test case is still awaiting action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_269.wav	2.61	She is under police escort.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_270.wav	2.90	However, that is not in itself enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_271.wav	2.78	That should not be their conclusion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_272.wav	2.05	We're going to fight it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_273.wav	2.18	The plot is minimal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_274.wav	3.42	His funeral is not expected until next week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_275.wav	2.48	Now we have had enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_276.wav	2.05	Can you believe it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_277.wav	2.69	He is certainly not looking for another job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_278.wav	2.35	I have a problem with these things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_280.wav	3.03	The gap is closing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_281.wav	2.56	Then there was her childhood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_282.wav	2.48	Other people had looked at it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_283.wav	2.44	And the other winners are.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_284.wav	2.26	It was quite a sight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_285.wav	2.22	But he was far from alone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_286.wav	3.29	We have got no money to go anywhere.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_287.wav	2.78	I believe he could have turned it around.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_288.wav	2.65	The Believer isn't just a movie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_289.wav	1.97	You are looking at him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_290.wav	2.14	The best team won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_291.wav	3.16	It being the weekend, there was no-one there.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_292.wav	2.43	It was an achievement all right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_293.wav	2.91	They think that it matters but it doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_294.wav	2.78	He was pronounced dead in hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_295.wav	1.97	It should be equal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_296.wav	2.39	It will make a big difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_297.wav	2.31	I want to make a difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_298.wav	2.78	What was the cause of all this outrage?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_299.wav	2.73	He will have it within two weeks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_300.wav	2.35	How do you feel?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_301.wav	2.69	It is a terrible state of affairs.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_302.wav	1.70	It was not the right time for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_303.wav	1.42	But they have the sound.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_304.wav	2.60	Not all women are dismayed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_305.wav	2.48	There will have to be a full inquiry.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_306.wav	2.73	It is not just in Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_307.wav	2.35	It's never happened before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_308.wav	2.27	It was a deeper deception.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_309.wav	2.30	Norton was delighted with his successes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_310.wav	2.15	The figures are bad, but not that bad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_311.wav	2.18	There is another side to it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_312.wav	2.39	His remit is specific.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_313.wav	2.95	It will be very damaging for research.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_314.wav	2.01	I'm a bit overwhelmed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_315.wav	2.48	The Old Firm are growing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_316.wav	2.26	They want to win the title.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_317.wav	2.95	Her concerns were not without foundation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_318.wav	2.95	This decision is a farce.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_319.wav	2.78	That would be the constructive way forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_320.wav	3.12	My view has now completely changed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_321.wav	2.60	It was blown out of proportion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_322.wav	3.16	You have no chance of planning permission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_323.wav	2.91	That is taking place in Strathclyde.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_324.wav	1.34	He was in a mood.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_325.wav	2.73	Was this element always there?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_326.wav	2.56	This is an awful lot of money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_327.wav	2.31	He was the architect.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_328.wav	3.03	The United Nations must act.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_329.wav	2.01	They haven't got a hope.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_330.wav	2.52	He was a national treasure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_331.wav	2.48	I think they are right to be impatient.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_332.wav	2.05	We need to regroup.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_333.wav	2.44	I must make that clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_334.wav	3.12	The board is currently resolving its differences.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_335.wav	2.43	I've never regretted coming here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_336.wav	3.37	He is in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_337.wav	2.60	I just had to go for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_338.wav	2.48	It seems to go down well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_339.wav	2.65	I am feeling on top of the world.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_341.wav	2.10	I don't know, really.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_343.wav	3.97	Therefore there is a threat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_344.wav	3.16	She would love it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_345.wav	3.37	One was taken to hospital.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_346.wav	2.65	You did not see it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_347.wav	2.52	Gritty he did not want.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_348.wav	3.12	The world is being invited to visit.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_349.wav	2.86	Nobody was able to escape.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_350.wav	2.73	Surely the answer is yes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_351.wav	2.86	Secondly, there is the question of money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_352.wav	2.35	He was later deported.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_353.wav	2.82	I only found out about it this morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_354.wav	0.91	I am not sure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_355.wav	3.54	One might think that it is a power.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_356.wav	2.73	This place is outstanding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_357.wav	2.44	Obviously we want to stop the rot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_358.wav	2.60	But it is a fact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_359.wav	3.41	They never seem to do anything about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_360.wav	2.60	We're going to sleep.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_361.wav	3.37	It raises a serious question mark.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_362.wav	3.42	The work with Alison was a great experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_363.wav	1.92	It was great fun.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_364.wav	3.16	Experience in this work is paramount.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_365.wav	3.88	It has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_366.wav	3.03	It is not needed, it should go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_367.wav	3.29	She had not suffered any physical injury.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_368.wav	2.56	We have a business to run.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_369.wav	3.20	We have been overwhelmed by the response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_370.wav	2.26	And there are others.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_371.wav	2.65	However, it was well worth the wait.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_372.wav	2.12	I think we did well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_373.wav	2.86	Only two things are certain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_374.wav	2.35	There is nothing to fear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_375.wav	2.44	Just look at his record.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_376.wav	2.05	He was a legend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_377.wav	2.22	It is a memorial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_378.wav	2.43	I have no evidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_379.wav	1.84	But is he?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_380.wav	3.12	We were very unhappy with the incident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_381.wav	2.65	The challenge is to win a cup.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_382.wav	3.16	It is something that we would support.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_383.wav	3.72	It was a double tragedy for the family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_384.wav	2.35	We are in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_385.wav	2.99	Does it really matter?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_386.wav	3.25	I loved it - and so did my friend.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_387.wav	3.08	A decision is expected today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_388.wav	2.01	I am enjoying it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_389.wav	2.52	It wasn't very pretty to watch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_390.wav	2.48	You have to go for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_391.wav	2.22	Are these immoral?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_392.wav	2.69	It has been a massive success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_393.wav	2.39	It is for the same reason.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_394.wav	2.73	The whole thing has been a nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_395.wav	2.90	Players are fighting to stay in the team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_396.wav	2.82	He will have something to say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_397.wav	2.48	You can't take a chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_398.wav	2.95	I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_399.wav	2.61	There is a lack of logic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_401.wav	3.25	We are about to have our own Parliament.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_402.wav	1.82	I am desperate to play for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_403.wav	1.95	It is a large number.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_404.wav	2.48	She doesn't know where to begin.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_405.wav	2.31	This is your chance.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_406.wav	2.61	I'm not allowed to speak to anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_407.wav	2.39	There's nothing she can't do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_408.wav	3.24	Nicolson is no stranger to the Highlands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_409.wav	2.73	I'd love the chance to play for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_410.wav	2.99	Clearly the impact is going to be negative.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_411.wav	2.27	He died in September.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_412.wav	2.69	It was not even this century.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_413.wav	2.14	That was really tough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_414.wav	2.65	It's not going to last five minutes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_415.wav	2.48	I am happy with my form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_416.wav	2.31	That's the name of the game, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_417.wav	3.08	With him are the symbols of his faith.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_418.wav	2.57	Overall, it has certainly worked out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_419.wav	2.26	This is actually true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_420.wav	2.78	Both were reduced to rubble.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_421.wav	2.86	It could have taken another two months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_422.wav	2.99	Hopefully, the answer is in the positive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p363\p363_423.wav	3.20	He said he had no reports of casualties.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_001.wav	2.39	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_002.wav	3.98	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_003.wav	8.58	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_004.wav	6.23	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_005.wav	7.15	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_006.wav	6.15	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_007.wav	6.19	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_008.wav	9.43	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_009.wav	6.36	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_010.wav	4.01	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_011.wav	8.24	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_012.wav	5.59	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_013.wav	5.21	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_014.wav	5.42	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_015.wav	7.94	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_016.wav	7.98	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_017.wav	4.49	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_018.wav	6.79	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_019.wav	8.67	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_020.wav	4.78	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_021.wav	11.06	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_022.wav	7.90	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_023.wav	14.29	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_024.wav	9.05	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_025.wav	3.33	Is that not pathetic?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_026.wav	4.14	Our nation has been changed by this event.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_027.wav	3.46	That would be a big step forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_028.wav	3.33	I love you so very much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_029.wav	3.63	Scotland needs to hear it, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_030.wav	4.10	Prime minister Blair is not that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_031.wav	4.10	But at the moment there isn't the budget.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_032.wav	3.38	It is not a matter of concern.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_033.wav	3.29	We're not either of those things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_034.wav	3.97	The man has already had too many chances.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_035.wav	3.16	It shouldn't be a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_036.wav	3.84	It was very moving, actually.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_037.wav	2.99	It isn't a free-for-all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_038.wav	3.76	PENSIONS have been hitting the headlines.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_039.wav	3.42	I was not fit enough and it showed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_040.wav	3.42	I thought it was the only way out.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_041.wav	3.54	We welcome the ministers decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_042.wav	3.20	Since then it has become a tradition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_043.wav	2.73	The concept is simple.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_044.wav	3.59	That is how the Farmer is feeling today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_045.wav	3.42	And that's the trouble with this business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_046.wav	2.91	So what did he do?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_047.wav	3.24	We must not give in to bastards.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_048.wav	4.06	The trial will open today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_049.wav	2.43	But it didn't happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_050.wav	2.61	What do you think they said?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_051.wav	3.50	There will be no disruption in the schools.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_053.wav	2.77	I can live with that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_054.wav	2.95	There is no doubt about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_055.wav	2.57	The president took offence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_056.wav	3.37	Our commitment is to move forward.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_057.wav	3.37	Partly, it is his own fault.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_058.wav	2.65	That's where it all started.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_059.wav	2.90	The family is so happy for him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_060.wav	3.41	Why has it taken so long?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_061.wav	2.82	No-one knows the numbers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_062.wav	2.30	You make the choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_063.wav	4.44	It is not the fault of one man, of course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_064.wav	2.95	I knew the script.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_065.wav	2.90	It's not going to work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_066.wav	2.91	He leaves a beat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_067.wav	2.78	Perhaps it was her demeanour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_068.wav	2.95	I see no need to change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_069.wav	3.20	It lasted longer than we thought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_070.wav	2.61	They've got more time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_071.wav	3.24	They made a huge impression on me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_072.wav	2.69	There is no hiding place.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_073.wav	3.93	A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_074.wav	3.37	This was a massive result for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_075.wav	2.91	It's not in my nature.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_076.wav	4.18	You see - this business is a good one.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_077.wav	2.22	Who is he?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_078.wav	3.03	Scotland were on Saturday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_079.wav	3.24	He wanted to talk to me about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_081.wav	3.37	That would be a big mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_082.wav	3.03	No-one has spoken to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_083.wav	3.46	His arrival could be the making of them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_084.wav	1.54	I was close enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_085.wav	2.35	He dismissed the action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_086.wav	2.86	I said How much?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_087.wav	3.38	I support the stand that they are making.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_088.wav	2.95	The couple had one daughter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_089.wav	2.90	But was it really so big?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_090.wav	3.29	Nature will not find its own level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_091.wav	2.65	I didn't have the choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_092.wav	3.07	But this has already been rejected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_094.wav	2.86	They have not seen her for years.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_095.wav	3.21	It was good to score the goal today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_096.wav	3.46	Allison is not convinced.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_097.wav	3.08	He felt there was no case to answer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_098.wav	2.69	This is a one-off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_099.wav	2.27	He liked to talk.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_100.wav	3.20	Lots of others were doing the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_101.wav	3.25	It is still holding good today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_102.wav	2.82	This takes the pressure off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_103.wav	3.16	Our legal advice is clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_104.wav	2.56	But he has a lifeline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_105.wav	2.73	This is a horrible loss.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_106.wav	3.67	Long-term, it was the right thing to do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_107.wav	2.78	We are not leaving the area.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_108.wav	4.22	The airspace above the theatre was closed off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_109.wav	3.07	Success in Scotland is important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_110.wav	2.95	We could do a lot worse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_111.wav	2.00	I know the worry over Iraq.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_112.wav	2.65	The outcome is now in our own hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_113.wav	2.56	It was just great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_114.wav	3.88	You are always aware of the injury potential.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_115.wav	2.95	We don't know what is happening to them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_116.wav	2.52	It's an old story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_117.wav	3.12	It was an important part of the course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_118.wav	2.69	It has been a great success.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_119.wav	3.46	I will be trying to do better tomorrow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_120.wav	3.97	Who will take them after that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_121.wav	2.65	It is part of their job.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_122.wav	3.80	This decision is a victory for common sense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_123.wav	2.44	One is too many.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_124.wav	2.13	What can you say?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_125.wav	3.84	This means that our programme is quite unusual.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_126.wav	3.16	The money all appears to be gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_127.wav	2.19	He was extremely ill.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_128.wav	2.68	This time, it was not be.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_129.wav	3.46	They are unable to say anything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_130.wav	2.84	The timing is wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_131.wav	2.21	That's why he is a national treasure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_132.wav	2.73	He just attracted people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_133.wav	2.18	He will be fine.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_134.wav	3.55	I love a clever reader.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_135.wav	3.33	There will be no exceptions to this rule.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_136.wav	2.78	But he's a very quiet man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_137.wav	3.37	Destruction came from within.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_138.wav	2.48	It's not their fault.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_140.wav	2.43	It won the match.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_141.wav	3.71	New investment will be openly tendered.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_142.wav	3.76	I'd never have called a doctor for myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_143.wav	3.20	It is sponsored by The Herald.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_144.wav	3.16	I don't entirely buy that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_145.wav	3.76	It was the rugby writers dinner in London.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_146.wav	3.93	The casting of her husband was an accident.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_147.wav	2.35	I would say so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_148.wav	2.40	I've had six days of rehearsal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_149.wav	2.43	It's a good story.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_150.wav	2.31	Do not listen to them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_151.wav	1.37	It was too soon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_152.wav	2.51	It is an absolute disgrace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_153.wav	2.26	I don't think it is the case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_154.wav	2.90	Everyone would have been happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_155.wav	2.39	It has paid off.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_156.wav	2.82	Ferguson had done his homework.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_157.wav	2.35	He deserved that much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_158.wav	2.82	We want to know about the policy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_159.wav	3.20	Mr Blair defended his wife.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_160.wav	2.69	He has gone back to school.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_161.wav	2.18	It is not illegal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_162.wav	2.82	I don't know where it went.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_163.wav	2.94	There was nothing anyone could do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_164.wav	2.52	I don't want to use the term.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_165.wav	3.55	I really feel sorry for the Irish.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_166.wav	3.42	Now they have to do something about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_167.wav	2.69	The post will be unpaid.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_168.wav	3.54	One-third of the places are already taken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_169.wav	2.52	I hope that doesn't happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_170.wav	2.99	It's all happening at a local level.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_171.wav	2.95	You will never replace the child.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_172.wav	2.18	We must do that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_173.wav	3.07	England will be under a lot of pressure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_174.wav	2.73	This has been fantastic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_175.wav	2.82	I'm delighted for the lads.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_176.wav	2.56	I learned that only yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_177.wav	3.12	It's very very frustrating.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_178.wav	2.82	We want him to continue that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_179.wav	3.20	But he did not rule out further talks.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_180.wav	2.86	Our children are our future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_181.wav	2.39	It's part of your life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_182.wav	3.20	We will see how he is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_183.wav	2.31	He had a horror.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_184.wav	2.69	So it was in politics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_185.wav	3.24	There are two offerings from Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_187.wav	2.99	The matter has been reported to the police.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_188.wav	2.43	We are at war.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_189.wav	3.97	We do know the reaction of the SAC.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_190.wav	3.37	The state is controlled by the left.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_191.wav	2.78	The principle is quite clear.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_192.wav	3.33	Despite that, it was a great day for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_193.wav	3.16	I would say the risk is very small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_194.wav	3.03	And there are different perspectives.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_195.wav	3.20	Mr Wallace was unimpressed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_196.wav	2.52	I put the drawing down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_197.wav	2.91	The hearing continues today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_198.wav	2.05	You would be wrong.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_199.wav	3.42	On recent evidence, he will not be missed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_200.wav	3.72	Police have refused to name the couple involved.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_201.wav	3.63	Our destiny is in our own hands.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_202.wav	2.69	The attitude was good today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_203.wav	2.69	I've got nothing to say.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_204.wav	3.03	It requires a wider team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_205.wav	2.52	It is so beautiful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_206.wav	3.16	It is suitable and sensible.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_207.wav	3.29	In many ways it was disastrous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_208.wav	2.95	I am really, really happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_209.wav	2.61	This is perfectly legal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_210.wav	2.82	I'm not interested in money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_211.wav	3.46	I'm looking forward to racing Donovan.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_212.wav	2.61	I can handle the pace.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_213.wav	2.39	I am happy to be here.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_214.wav	3.29	We are seeking a meeting with the Minister.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_215.wav	3.33	I believe it would have been successful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_216.wav	2.82	It's better to be happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_217.wav	2.95	It's happened, but it's a dream.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_218.wav	2.14	I had a son.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_219.wav	2.99	It was very, very frightening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_220.wav	3.37	That suggests that out fitness is good.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_221.wav	2.18	I had no choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_222.wav	2.43	What do you do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_223.wav	3.41	It would also delay the Scottish results.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_224.wav	2.35	This one would have been.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_225.wav	2.48	We just have to improve.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_226.wav	2.86	It hasn't worked out that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_227.wav	2.78	This is very good news.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_228.wav	3.80	Is it a warning to parents?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_229.wav	3.59	Everything is surrounded by confusion.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_230.wav	2.86	There is nothing wrong with that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_231.wav	2.69	I could not believe the results.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_232.wav	2.27	What do you do?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_233.wav	3.72	And there are some interesting conductors, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_234.wav	2.77	It was all over for us then.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_235.wav	2.78	They were assured that it would.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_236.wav	2.74	Thankfully they liked it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_237.wav	3.46	I am very encouraged by this poll.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_238.wav	2.82	We just do not do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_239.wav	2.56	It was a long time coming.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_240.wav	2.39	It had happened to him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_241.wav	2.86	That is our business.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_242.wav	2.78	We were completely outplayed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_243.wav	2.95	The car driver was not injured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_244.wav	2.77	It was a surprising decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_245.wav	3.24	Colin Cameron was excellent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_246.wav	3.24	I believe in having difficult times.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_247.wav	2.82	Stand by for action.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_248.wav	2.65	It was something special.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_249.wav	2.90	He deserves a top team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_250.wav	2.94	We just need the Government to act.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_251.wav	2.65	It was really surprising.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_252.wav	2.13	It was a nightmare.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_253.wav	2.73	But this is just the first step.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_254.wav	1.88	We can do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_255.wav	2.69	This is as bad as it gets.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_256.wav	2.95	The real issue is personal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_257.wav	2.56	That can happen so easily.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_258.wav	3.50	We deserved to get the victory today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_259.wav	2.95	That's the last thing he will do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_260.wav	4.31	FIRST, we had the Battle of Britain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_261.wav	2.69	It does not take much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_262.wav	3.38	It would be a bonus for this game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_263.wav	2.78	I've seen it work already.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_264.wav	2.31	Do you mean today?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_265.wav	3.67	Israeli forces denied the claim.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_266.wav	3.07	This could be the case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_267.wav	2.90	We try to keep it right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_268.wav	2.86	I have got to keep the lid on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_269.wav	2.22	Or so we thought.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_270.wav	3.80	For many, it had become a fact of life.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_271.wav	3.41	Last season was very hard for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_272.wav	3.24	It was a definite penalty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_273.wav	4.14	It's great fun to get to act.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_274.wav	2.94	We are keen to have him back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_275.wav	3.29	Horses have some sense.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_276.wav	2.31	It goes in cycles.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_277.wav	3.41	And now he has decided, enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_278.wav	4.82	Visiting fans were banned from attending the game.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_279.wav	2.31	He made no comment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_280.wav	2.35	We have to get on with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_281.wav	3.25	He was at the game, and he is indeed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_282.wav	3.24	It would be dangerous to resign.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_283.wav	3.16	It is a victory to that extent.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_284.wav	3.54	Clearly, the future remains uncertain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_285.wav	2.26	I certainly hope so.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_286.wav	2.74	She died later on Monday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_287.wav	2.56	It does and it doesn't.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_288.wav	3.12	It will not be today, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_289.wav	2.65	We suspect he was pleased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_290.wav	2.99	I have been here for only three months.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_291.wav	2.73	We have no knowledge of this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_292.wav	2.52	I was the willing journeyman.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_293.wav	2.71	I know we ask a lot of you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_294.wav	3.33	When he got up he was hit again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_297.wav	1.72	It was just one man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_298.wav	1.45	It's going to be tough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_299.wav	1.93	You will be very, very welcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_300.wav	2.91	I really want to win in Glasgow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_301.wav	2.14	Is he any good?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_302.wav	4.23	The proposals have been taken out of context.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_303.wav	2.99	It was then that Rangers scored.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_304.wav	3.08	This was repeated the second time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_305.wav	2.60	I chose the former.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_306.wav	2.86	Sub Not Used, McKee.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_308.wav	2.90	They were very responsive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p364\p364_309.wav	2.22	We're talking to him.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_001.wav	2.78	Please call Stella.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_002.wav	4.48	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_003.wav	8.53	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_004.wav	6.40	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_005.wav	8.45	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_006.wav	6.53	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_007.wav	5.34	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_008.wav	8.92	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_009.wav	5.47	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_010.wav	3.59	People look, but no one ever finds it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_011.wav	7.81	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_012.wav	5.38	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_013.wav	4.83	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_014.wav	5.68	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_015.wav	6.23	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_016.wav	7.43	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_017.wav	4.05	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_018.wav	6.32	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_019.wav	7.94	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_020.wav	5.64	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_021.wav	10.54	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_022.wav	7.60	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_023.wav	13.31	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_024.wav	8.02	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_025.wav	3.12	She had to learn a new discipline.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_026.wav	3.33	This isn't some form of commission.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_027.wav	3.63	The game today is certainly different.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_028.wav	2.61	We did it in one take.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_029.wav	2.56	I'll take the blame for that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_030.wav	2.95	And that was just for starters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_031.wav	3.67	In order to get there, we have got to invest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_032.wav	3.41	Why did it take a concerted campaign?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_033.wav	3.25	I will always remember the horrible images.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_034.wav	2.91	What you sow, you have to reap.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_035.wav	2.69	We are expecting a big crowd.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_036.wav	2.61	I was contacted this morning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_037.wav	2.82	He didn't want me to leave the house.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_038.wav	2.78	It's not just a challenge for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_039.wav	3.08	But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_040.wav	1.84	I've had a ball.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_041.wav	2.95	Treatment is not an issue with these people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_042.wav	2.39	YOU thought it was a headache.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_043.wav	2.39	I still hope to go.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_044.wav	2.78	Does that put pressure on us?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_045.wav	3.33	As a player you have to move on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_046.wav	3.50	It is so out of character.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_047.wav	2.60	I am inclined to play it down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_048.wav	2.99	However, it's good to turn the page.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_049.wav	2.95	His condition was serious but stable.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_050.wav	2.74	He had reason to be pleased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_051.wav	2.31	We have a problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_052.wav	2.91	I find it puzzling and disturbing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_053.wav	2.56	That alibi is now gone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_054.wav	3.12	But the cost to his health was enormous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_055.wav	2.05	I suspect the latter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_056.wav	4.48	However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_057.wav	2.26	It is simple, really.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_058.wav	2.35	The net is closing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_059.wav	3.71	I cannot believe she has been admonished.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_060.wav	2.61	That took a long time to happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_061.wav	2.05	It was on fire.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_062.wav	3.67	This year the exercise is being repeated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_063.wav	2.61	Nobody did in those days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_064.wav	3.46	You, the British people, are the boss.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_065.wav	2.65	Where is the discipline?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_066.wav	3.25	We were very much a happy family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_067.wav	3.08	They won the trophy in the Hoops.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_068.wav	2.65	This time it is official.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_069.wav	2.52	It's going to be epic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_070.wav	2.86	She could easily have been killed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_071.wav	4.44	Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_072.wav	2.65	I didn't mean to kill her.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_073.wav	4.35	We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_074.wav	3.54	That money could have been coming to Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_075.wav	3.03	I'd love to do another Olympics.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_076.wav	3.08	What method of funding is being used?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_077.wav	2.65	It is not a standing army.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_078.wav	2.82	This is a great day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_079.wav	2.56	He got his degree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_080.wav	3.55	I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_081.wav	2.69	and their remit is limited.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_082.wav	4.10	I have great respect for all my players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_083.wav	3.59	They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_084.wav	3.03	There is no question of dithering.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_085.wav	3.03	His track record is not promising.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_086.wav	3.97	Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_087.wav	2.56	It would be very dangerous.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_088.wav	3.07	Now it has been eclipsed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_089.wav	2.56	Our numbers are small.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_090.wav	3.84	We have no idea what caused the derailment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_091.wav	3.24	I am confident of the outcome this week.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_092.wav	2.74	It's not right of Labour.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_093.wav	2.90	It doesn't always work that way.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_094.wav	2.73	This was much worse.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_095.wav	2.69	That, though, is not true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_096.wav	3.37	I'm working at the moment.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_097.wav	3.03	However, this is only the start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_098.wav	3.63	They might also be reviewed by their colleagues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_099.wav	3.03	He loved it, and so did they.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_100.wav	3.03	I want to be there by right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_101.wav	2.56	That was very important.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_102.wav	3.12	Two and a half million people have died.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_103.wav	2.52	I hope they understand that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_104.wav	3.37	Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_105.wav	2.90	It's a very, very special day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_106.wav	2.56	Let that be their memorial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_107.wav	2.30	We're all paying for it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_108.wav	2.26	Lester was like that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_109.wav	3.67	Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_110.wav	3.63	That is very, very bad news for our nation.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_111.wav	3.42	We were never told it was already decided.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_112.wav	2.61	It was a sickening sight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_113.wav	4.69	We are at an advanced stage, and are now instructing counsel.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_114.wav	3.20	I don't think it would make any difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_115.wav	3.50	They have just got to believe in themselves.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_116.wav	2.99	If that is not a warning, what is it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_117.wav	2.94	I fell in love with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_118.wav	3.71	It ignores the future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_119.wav	3.29	The quality of work is very impressive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_120.wav	3.12	That's not going to happen again.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_121.wav	2.61	Paterson was the man.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_122.wav	2.82	The course is in great condition.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_123.wav	3.42	Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_124.wav	2.78	It is too early to speculate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_125.wav	2.13	It's up to them.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_126.wav	2.30	They went to the press.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_127.wav	2.52	I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_128.wav	4.95	We are very pleased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_129.wav	3.03	You're not going to get hurt.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_130.wav	3.58	THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_131.wav	2.86	I was very fortunate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_132.wav	3.42	It had been in place since last July.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_133.wav	3.67	Players want to know what is on offer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_134.wav	2.31	They are a good team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_135.wav	2.73	The contest was already over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_136.wav	2.26	Does it make a profit?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_137.wav	2.94	Now, that would impress the kids.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_138.wav	3.33	It was the only possible decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_139.wav	3.03	How much of a cop out is that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_140.wav	3.25	The whole region is in shock.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_141.wav	2.86	Where is the logic in that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_142.wav	4.27	I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_143.wav	3.25	I told the players that at half-time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_144.wav	3.55	I see the extended family once a year.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_145.wav	2.35	Why is this?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_146.wav	3.07	It was indeed a night to remember.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_147.wav	3.16	Raymond was always on the outside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_148.wav	2.91	There is something in this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_149.wav	2.52	And so it should.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_150.wav	3.97	News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_151.wav	2.95	They may differ on other issues.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_152.wav	2.52	That's the important thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_153.wav	2.69	But opinion was divided.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_154.wav	3.42	Next league matches Motherwell.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_155.wav	2.82	I have been there already.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_156.wav	3.38	My wife is totally behind me on this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_157.wav	3.42	Scott and Emily were so happy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_158.wav	3.33	Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_159.wav	3.29	But every two minutes it was exploding.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_160.wav	2.99	And sooner than we may think.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_161.wav	2.22	It is a step up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_162.wav	3.33	You probably have never seen them before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_163.wav	3.84	However, it is not all bad news for women.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_164.wav	3.50	We're very proud of him and his achievement.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_165.wav	2.35	Something has got to change.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_166.wav	2.14	I made a mistake.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_167.wav	2.82	I'd never given up on myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_168.wav	3.63	That prevented any recurrence of the problem.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_169.wav	3.16	That's the kind of production it was.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_170.wav	2.69	Little girls are his victims.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_171.wav	2.22	It is not for me, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_172.wav	4.10	Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_173.wav	2.61	The rest is his own.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_174.wav	2.60	The statement was a lie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_175.wav	2.69	It is the manager's decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_176.wav	2.65	It was a day for records.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_177.wav	3.33	The Government has to grasp the nettle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_178.wav	2.52	There's no reason for panic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_179.wav	2.26	We have got away with it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_180.wav	3.76	However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_181.wav	2.90	I was doing well at the hustings.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_182.wav	2.44	He had planned to sell it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_183.wav	2.78	It was just one of those days.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_184.wav	2.39	But it did not last.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_185.wav	2.95	She has been unable to work since.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_186.wav	3.03	No-one has ever seen inside.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_187.wav	2.91	I know nothing about that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_188.wav	2.56	We have not given up.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_189.wav	4.35	Archer is no newcomer to the stage.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_190.wav	2.31	It's a matter of time.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_191.wav	2.05	The number never came.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_192.wav	3.24	You encourage them - you can do it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_193.wav	3.42	The winner will be announced by early summer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_194.wav	2.82	This is the New Edinburgh.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_195.wav	2.31	The stadium was full.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_196.wav	3.41	There isn't much of a scene in Austria.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_197.wav	2.56	Perhaps it is jealousy.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_198.wav	2.65	His name is Michael Owen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_199.wav	3.71	Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_200.wav	3.08	I didn't want to ignore the punters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_201.wav	2.86	This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_202.wav	3.20	I foolishly had done nothing about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_203.wav	4.19	Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_204.wav	2.31	It was so unfair.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_205.wav	2.73	Smith has not let him down.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_206.wav	3.71	They have to be dealt with.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_207.wav	2.95	Glasgow is a friendly city.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_208.wav	3.29	No, it's actually in a block of flats.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_209.wav	3.16	They were that poor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_210.wav	3.88	It was an odd affair, in many respects.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_211.wav	3.29	Stan is a vital part of our future.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_212.wav	3.50	We're very close to being a good team.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_213.wav	3.12	All these things have an impact.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_214.wav	3.25	I thought their commitment was superb.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_215.wav	3.33	I'm really proud of my young players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_216.wav	3.54	There was great support all round the route.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_217.wav	2.14	I had nothing to lose.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_218.wav	2.52	That is just not true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_219.wav	2.86	History is made at the Masters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_220.wav	2.69	This is not a European Army.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_221.wav	3.03	Not so, he insisted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_222.wav	3.16	All of the names are familiar to me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_223.wav	2.52	I wonder what they listen to?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_224.wav	2.61	Does a lot of drawing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_225.wav	3.97	A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_226.wav	3.59	There are moments of honesty, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_227.wav	2.30	He is doing just that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_228.wav	1.88	The night is young.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_229.wav	2.39	That is bad enough.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_230.wav	2.86	We used to keep our business rates.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_231.wav	2.31	I suspect that it will.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_232.wav	2.27	We need to think.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_233.wav	2.99	We are very happy with the verdict.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_234.wav	2.31	They want it to work.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_235.wav	2.65	For once it wasn't about money.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_236.wav	3.12	It's not the end of the matter, of course.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_237.wav	2.65	That doesn't happen in Europe.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_238.wav	2.43	Jackson may well be right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_239.wav	2.74	Then it was the turn of the carnival.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_240.wav	3.46	He's very, very lucky to be alive.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_241.wav	2.73	It's always somebody else's.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_242.wav	2.82	It could now be up to the courts.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_243.wav	2.44	We can make a difference.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_244.wav	2.52	This was not a contest.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_245.wav	2.61	It is just so sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_246.wav	3.63	Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_247.wav	3.42	This was not an easy meeting for me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_248.wav	2.73	It all depends on the Chancellor.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_249.wav	2.90	I get very excited by that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_250.wav	2.82	The members have clearly spoken.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_251.wav	2.35	It was not pretty.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_252.wav	3.08	It was like a scene from the Holocaust.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_253.wav	2.56	Which means it matters.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_254.wav	2.82	This is certainly not the case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_255.wav	3.37	There is great potential on this river.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_256.wav	2.82	It's very difficult to find a buyer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_257.wav	2.61	Our thoughts are with his family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_258.wav	2.01	It is a technique.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_259.wav	2.35	The court has not decided.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_260.wav	2.56	I feel sorry for the Reds.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_261.wav	2.35	I just want to get rid of it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_262.wav	3.59	I have not come in to take over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_263.wav	2.05	Is this accurate?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_264.wav	2.39	But what did it matter?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_265.wav	3.93	Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_266.wav	2.43	I am expecting to win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_267.wav	4.01	It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_268.wav	2.39	I was an athlete.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_269.wav	3.03	We don't need to change the law.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_270.wav	2.01	All of us do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_271.wav	3.46	Three months or so later, they are returning.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_272.wav	4.57	That is partly true, but there are ways of doing it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_273.wav	2.99	We can only do that for so long.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_274.wav	2.52	He got very close tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_275.wav	2.99	I don't know why you say goodbye.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_276.wav	2.65	It is our other home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_277.wav	2.44	Where do you start?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_278.wav	3.37	At the end of the day, two men have been shot.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_279.wav	2.60	It was the first time they met.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_280.wav	3.25	I am also delighted for all the players.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_281.wav	3.29	We are delighted with that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_282.wav	3.59	He did very well, but didn't win.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_283.wav	2.48	And we're not there yet.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_284.wav	3.33	People don't feel safe, including me.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_285.wav	3.58	Later we discovered it was a hoax.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_286.wav	3.42	They want to shut the Scottish Office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_287.wav	3.93	It is something that we will put right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_288.wav	2.86	I had a good life at Rangers.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_289.wav	2.73	Perhaps we should do the same.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_290.wav	3.37	He's very good at relating to adults.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_291.wav	2.48	It opened last month.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_292.wav	2.82	Just a year later he was dead.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_293.wav	2.82	You must be ready to play anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_294.wav	2.78	This is a club on the rise.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_295.wav	2.82	I had a sense of deja vu.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_296.wav	2.73	That was the theory, anyway.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_297.wav	2.86	I don't know them or anything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_298.wav	3.50	I couldn't make out what was going on.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_299.wav	3.03	That's what we're trying to achieve.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_300.wav	2.90	Because we do not need it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_301.wav	2.56	The atmosphere is businesslike.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_302.wav	3.08	They use them for everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_303.wav	2.26	I've already got this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_304.wav	2.22	There's a story, too.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_305.wav	3.93	There have been different reports from different people.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_306.wav	3.12	But it has all been worthwhile.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_307.wav	3.42	But that's another story for another day.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_308.wav	2.69	It was a foolhardy decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_309.wav	3.16	This is as bad as it can get.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_310.wav	4.18	And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_311.wav	2.43	It was just awful.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_312.wav	2.82	There was a hell of a row.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_313.wav	2.99	We are satisfied with this outcome.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_314.wav	2.78	I am not a threat to coaches.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_315.wav	3.12	It's never over until it's over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_316.wav	2.69	He had been a singer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_317.wav	3.42	I was very pleased with them today, though.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_318.wav	3.59	If you're going to do it, do it right.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_319.wav	3.76	We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_320.wav	2.18	No one was listening.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_321.wav	2.78	It's not one for the purists.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_322.wav	3.41	It may now be too expensive for anyone.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_323.wav	2.99	It really is good to be back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_324.wav	3.16	We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_325.wav	2.39	It will never happen.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_326.wav	2.35	We cannot go on like this.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_327.wav	2.52	The biggest thing is structure.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_328.wav	3.07	This could be a recipe for conflict.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_329.wav	2.48	This is great news for us.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_330.wav	2.90	We certainly have to try something.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_331.wav	3.37	SO now we know the secret.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_332.wav	3.33	Harrowing is easy, after all.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_333.wav	2.35	What is that?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_334.wav	2.78	We just want them home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_335.wav	2.95	And we have beaten them before.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_336.wav	2.18	He has two children.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_337.wav	3.37	That is the fact of the matter.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_338.wav	3.97	It was a matter of choice.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_339.wav	3.71	And that's good news for the magpies.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_340.wav	3.63	But we can't have a casino.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_341.wav	2.90	I'm looking forward to that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_342.wav	2.73	So what is their secret?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_343.wav	2.91	It's a great idea.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_344.wav	3.33	It was not being marketed properly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_345.wav	3.29	I have been struggling with my form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_346.wav	2.18	That was about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_347.wav	2.48	It is coming on very well.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_348.wav	2.91	We won't go down without a struggle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_349.wav	2.48	By hard work, is the answer.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_350.wav	2.78	We were unlucky not to score.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_351.wav	3.07	I did not have a bet on myself.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_352.wav	2.73	As if they ever stopped.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_353.wav	2.99	And that brings us to the point.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_354.wav	2.99	Clark is back on top form.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_355.wav	2.69	But happily, the story is true.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_356.wav	2.43	It does seem a mystery.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_357.wav	4.78	Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_358.wav	3.67	It's for that reason he should resign.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_359.wav	2.31	It's a good start.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_360.wav	2.86	One person had a broken back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_361.wav	3.37	I hope that is the lucky break.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_362.wav	3.84	It is almost like a family.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_363.wav	3.42	But when we do it is great.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_364.wav	4.01	I disagree entirely with the decision.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_365.wav	2.48	My game is coming back.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_366.wav	3.12	It was a game they could have won.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_367.wav	3.16	Then came the collision with Sergio.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_368.wav	3.25	It is a matter for Westminster.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_369.wav	4.18	And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_370.wav	3.16	I can't believe the buzz.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_371.wav	2.14	Sport is good for you.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_372.wav	3.67	I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_373.wav	3.67	This is not a struggle against Islam.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_374.wav	2.48	This is the goal.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_375.wav	3.63	The mood was euphoric.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_376.wav	3.03	I want to get at the truth.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_377.wav	2.91	Everyone here is very sad.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_378.wav	3.50	It was located on the remote control.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_379.wav	2.56	I am not changing my mind.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_380.wav	3.50	Is something which we just don't do.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_381.wav	3.24	He was taken ill in his office.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_382.wav	3.84	It is, though the law is not clear cut.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_383.wav	2.39	It's the only thing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_384.wav	3.33	Two others were also seriously injured.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_385.wav	2.78	What's the best thing to do?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_386.wav	2.43	For tragedy it is.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_387.wav	3.16	I'm trying to stay open on that.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_388.wav	4.14	Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_389.wav	2.18	It was good today.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_390.wav	5.68	We are all very pleased.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_391.wav	3.20	The hotel was huge.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_392.wav	3.20	These days are over.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_393.wav	2.56	They do it properly.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_394.wav	2.99	Well, you can have a tree.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_395.wav	3.33	I just don't know what she was doing.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_396.wav	4.44	However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_397.wav	2.95	You can't have both.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_398.wav	3.89	That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_399.wav	3.03	I was influenced by all of these things.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_400.wav	2.99	You do not change overnight.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_401.wav	1.92	Or so it seemed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_402.wav	2.69	I will have to think about it.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_403.wav	3.24	He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_404.wav	2.48	Well, you can't have everything.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_405.wav	3.11	They have not given them the evidence.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_406.wav	2.26	We need to chat.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_407.wav	3.46	We are obviously disturbed by this case.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_408.wav	2.65	That was never their agenda.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_409.wav	2.57	I certainly will not settle.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_410.wav	4.01	He said it was the worst possible result.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_411.wav	3.46	It's very tragic and traumatic.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_412.wav	3.33	It's always the same, isn't it?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_413.wav	3.03	I don't make it mystical.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_414.wav	2.86	So what was he really doing?
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_415.wav	3.29	Neither could be contacted last night.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_416.wav	3.37	That clearly wasn't what they wanted.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_417.wav	4.48	Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_418.wav	3.59	And well he might.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_419.wav	2.78	They have not been named.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_420.wav	2.48	It feels like too much.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_421.wav	4.27	This is the last thing we ever expected.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_422.wav	3.46	Next year this time  we will be home.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_423.wav	2.52	That time has passed.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p374\p374_424.wav	2.39	It will be crucial.
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_001.wav	3.37	"Please call Stella.  "
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_002.wav	5.29	"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  "
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_003.wav	8.71	"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  "
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_004.wav	7.00	"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  "
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_005.wav	8.62	"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. "
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_006.wav	7.09	"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. "
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_007.wav	6.06	"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. "
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_008.wav	9.22	"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. "
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_009.wav	6.02	"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. "

VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_011.wav	9.48	"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. "
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_012.wav	5.51	"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. "
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_013.wav	5.68	"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. "
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_014.wav	7.09	"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. "
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_015.wav	9.39	"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. "
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_016.wav	7.17	"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. "
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_017.wav	4.18	"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. "
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_018.wav	4.95	"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. "
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_019.wav	6.87	"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. "
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_020.wav	4.53	"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. "
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_021.wav	8.32	"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. "
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_022.wav	6.96	"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. "
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_023.wav	12.63	"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. "
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_024.wav	8.32	"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_025.wav	4.78	"It's a relief that a decision has finally been made."
VCTK-Corpus/wav48\p376\p376_026.wav	2.22	"But it failed."
